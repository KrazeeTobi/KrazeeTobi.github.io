<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Yes, thats right, SAGE is fast
approaching and now's the time to get your entries in! But hold it right there, you feisty
younger whipper-snappers, this year the registration involves a bit more than just the
name of your booth and link. This year...you have to put effort into your registration! <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Step 1: </u></strong><br>
Obviously is the usual stuff. Team Name, Fan Game Details, Brief Description. Also, I
would like to have the links to your booths at least several days before SAGE. Basically,
if theres no page up a day or so before SAGE's launch (16th September 2002), then you
ain't getting in easily and will be left out of some of the cool stuff planned. <br>
<br>
<u><strong>Step 2:</strong></u> <br>
Here's where the effort comes in. Attatched to your email entry, there must be a Banner ad
for your Booth. This can be a banner of your Team Name, or the name of your main Fan-game
your promoting.<br>
<br>
Also, make sure its decent quality, let below 500kb. Send me a massive BMP file, and I may
just e-mail you it back 10 fold. <br>
<br>
<u><strong>Step 3:</strong></u> <br>
Heres a groovy little addition we've dreamed up: Promo Items--A singular item of interest,
related to your team or game. It could be a little statue, or a pie, as long as it's
original and groovy. <br>
<br>
Also add a description of your promo item. All will be revealed at SAGE, on 16th of
September. <br>
<br>
So, lets run a check list: <br>
<br>
<strong>-Booth Details (Team Name, Fangame details, URL of booth site) <br>
-Banner Ad <br>
-Promo Item and Description </strong><br>
<br>
Remember, this year, original games are also welcome. Since your all members of the SFGHQ
community, it's fair to say Sonic has influenced your own games you make, and since Waffle
X has been welcomed at previous SAGEs, I think its only fair this is the case for all
other original games. However, this doesn't mean Mario fangames, or DBZ fangames are
counted, as that wouldn't be original or Sonic games would it ;P <br>
<br>
So, here's the address:<br>
