    <p CLASS="headline" align="center">Sonic Robo Blast 2</p>
    <p align="center">Sonic Robo Blast II will be the first 3D Sonic fan-game, offering true
    Sonic-style gameplay. The game has been in development since March 1998, so this
    definitely is not a quick three-week rush job.<br>
    <br>
    <b>THE STORY</b><br>
    <br>
    After Eggman was defeated back in the first game, he decides to take more time to
    reconsider his strategy, hiding away in an underground base for three months. All Eggman
    really had to show for this delay was a reduced robot army and a special battleship he
    built called the 'Doomship'. He didn't stand a chance against Sonic and his friends.<br>
    <br>
    Eggman's space-radar bleeped as the Black Rock came within its range. Eggman thought
    nothing of it at first, until he realised that he had a new battlestation! From there he
    could attack the world, and launch robot armies without the fear of anyone retaliating
    against such a huge weapon.<br>
    <br>
    And with the Chaos Emeralds, the world would be begging before his knees to end the
    suffering and let him rule the planet. It was a perfect plan!<br>
    <br>
    Eggman decided to quickly increase the amount of robots he was producing. World domination
    was within his grasp at last! He launched his Doomship a week later, full of robots to
    take temporary control of zones until he'd finished putting the final touches to his work
    on the Black Rock. They were also instructed to find any Chaos Emeralds they might find.<br>
    <br>
    His first target: Greenflower City.<br>
    <br>
    Sonic was enjoying his long overdue vacation. Without Eggman around, he and everyone else
    could relax whenever they wanted. Little did he know that today was going to be the end of
    it. Hearing Tails' voice in the distance, Sonic rolled his eyes. It was probably a stray
    beach ball, thrown out into the sea. No doubt Tails wanted him to recover it.<br>
    <br>
    Tails arrived, and told him that there were robots attacking the Forest Zone. Before Tails
    could finish, Sonic was already a tiny dot on the horizon.<br>
    <br>
    The robots were simple Crawla robots, destroyed with minimal effort. Sonic looked up at
    the sky and to his horror, saw an enormous battleship, with its guns pointing at the
    Greenflower City. He had been tricked into a diversion! Without wasting time, Sonic rushed
    up to the Doomship, even though there was nothing he could really do.<br>
    <br>
    But it was too late. In a blinding flash, the Greenflower City was a pile of ash and
    rubble. Laughing at Sonic, Eggman revealed his plan to control the Black Rock and turn it
    into an unstoppable force of destruction. Then he flew off, leaving Sonic standing dead in
    his tracks.<br>
    <br>
    However, unlike last time, he would not be alone in the fight. Tails was willing to help,
    and Knuckles had also offered his assistance, realising that the Floating Island would
    also be in danger.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CHARACTERS</b><br>
    <br>
    SONIC THE HEDGEHOG<br>
    The blue streak returns again, ready to tackle Eggman and his robots. Definitely the
    quickest of all the three, but also the least versatile. He will find several areas
    inaccesible and must find new routes around them. That's not to say he's not learned
    anything since last time. He has a special 'Air Spin Attack' move, allowing him to shoot
    forwards at high speeds, aiding him in longer jumps and giving him automatic acceleration.<br>
    <br>
    MILES 'TAILS' PROWER<br>
    Having missed his first chance to help Sonic back in Sonic Robo Blast I, he is more than
    ready to help Sonic this time round. While nowhere near as fast as Sonic, he has his
    flying ability, which will help him over longer jumps and reach new areas.<br>
    <br>
    KNUCKLES THE ECHIDNA<br>
    Having played a minor role in stopping Eggman from the original Sonic Robo Blast, he
    returns to put Eggman out of commission once and for all. While he lacks Sonic's speed,
    and is barely faster than Tails, he retains his climbing and gliding skill. Although
    Knuckles has problems climbing on some surfaces, such as slippy moss or hard metal, he
    makes up for it by being able to attack enemies with his glide!<br>
    <br>
    <b>ZONES</b><br>
    <br>
    The game will feature over 30 levels of action, spread across nine zones.<br>
    <br>
    GREENFLOWER ZONE -<br>
    Considering Eggman's invasion has just started, the zone is relatively free of any robots,
    but that still doesn't mean you have time to enjoy the lush landscape. Features
    waterfalls, hidden caves and plenty of fauna.<br>
    <br>
    TECHNO HILL ZONE -<br>
    This was once a beatiful landscape, but has been mostly tainted by Eggman's chemical
    factory, pumping out slime. The factory was abandoned after his unsuccessful invasion, but
    has since come back to life! Watch out for the machines inside the factory, and the
    chemical dumping which is taking place outside.<br>
    <br>
    DEEP SEA ZONE -<br>
    Sonic, Tails and Knuckles stumble across some ruins, which have been flooded, partly by
    nature and partly by Eggman digging away for the Chaos Emeralds. Be wary of water traps
    which can threaten to drown you!<br>
    <br>
    MINE MAZE ZONE -<br>
    Following Eggman's trail from the Deep Sea Zone, you come across one of his new mines.
    Sadly, Eggman is not happy with your presence and the mining robots have turned their
    attention to you. Watch out for some more unstable parts of the mine and the robots.<br>
    <br>
    ROCKY MOUNTAIN ZONE -<br>
    Emerging from the mines, you come across a huge mountain. While Sonic must find a way to
    scale this, Tails and Knuckles can use their abilities to the fullest. Be careful not to
    enjoy the scenery too much, as there are plenty of falling platforms and obstacles.<br>
    <br>
    RED VOLCANO ZONE -<br>
    Finding Eggman's robots entering the volcano, you follow them to investigate what's
    happening. Rather than worrying about Eggman's traps here, you should be more concerned
    with the deadly lava, that threatens to rise without warning.<br>
    <br>
    DARK CITY ZONE -<br>
    You've finally reached the heart of Eggman's operations, however the robot denizens are
    less than pleased to see you. Eggman's security is pretty tight, and will certaintely slow
    you down as you try to board the Doomship.<br>
    <br>
    DOOMSHIP ZONE -<br>
    Now Sonic has entered the ship, and he must make his way to the control room to divert the
    course to the Eggrock, where he can stop Eggman's plans. But first, he has the small
    matter of dealing with the security system.<br>
    <br>
    EGGROCK ZONE -<br>
    You've finally arrived at the Eggrock Zone. Who knows what's in here? Except for a few
    surprises, maybe.<br>
    <br>
