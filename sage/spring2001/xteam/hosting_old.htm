        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana">When
        being a member of the SSRG staff team, you are expected
        to hold your best efforts at hand. We expect as little
        laziness as possible. If you're site isn't up to
        standards, we will notify you to ask that you please fix
        it and you will be given a certain amount of time to fix
        it. If you do not choose to keep up the work we expect
        from you otherwise, your account will be deleted. We try
        to treat all our members with the very best respect that
        we can offer and respectivley, we don't like to be unfair
        to anyone. So, we expect full respect from you as well.
        We used to have a requirement where updating the site
        once a week was at hand. However, while this rule would
        help draw visitors to the site on a timely manor, it
        became silly to watch an update that could normally occur
        in one day be spead out over several days. So, we don't
        ask that your page be updated every day, but we expect
        you to keep working on something related to website
        assignment. You should do this in a timely manor that is
        convenient to you. Keep in mind that we do go through the
        sites avalible on SSRG on a regular basis for quality
        control. If we are able to ask you &quot;why this and
        that has not been updated for X amount of time&quot;,
        then you have a problem.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana">You must
        also be serious about the site or project you want to
        have hosted on SSRG. If your plan is to just have a site
        on SSRG so you can brag to your friends, don't bother e-mailing
        us. We have hosted far too many lazy people who claim
        that they will start a kick-butt site only to do little
        or nothing and then disappear a few weeks later. It would
        be another story if your project was truely done. People
        who do this waste our time from doing something more
        importand, like search for betas. =) SSRG is about
        hosting the best of the best Sonic the Hedgehog related
        projects and not every STH website on the net.</font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">If you feel that your project is done
        and there is nothing left to do and/or you want to move
        on to do other things, let us know. We will surely honor
        your request to leave and we will be more than willing to
        keep your site on the server permanently if you so choose.</font></p>

            and what we expect</u></strong></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">There are no true requirements. In
        general, we will accept any project or website that
        relates to Sonic the Hedgehog. However, no fan stuff such
        as an MP3 archive, a fan fiction archive, etc. If you
        want to run a site like that, talk to the guys at Sonichq.org.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Which sites/projects do we accept and
        which ones do we reject is based apon the simple
        procedure of &quot;if we like it, we will host it&quot;.
        If we don't really care for it, we won't host it. The key
        is originality. If your goal is to mirror a section
        already on SSRG but under a different name, don't bother
        e-mailing us. After all, does it make sense to have two
        sections that cover the same exact things?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">However, if you feel that a section on
        SSRG is slacking and that you feel that you can be of
        major help to improve that section on SSRG, e-mail us.
        Perhaps the two of you could work together. I prefer to
        see people work TOGETHER instead of AGAINST each other.
        Collaboration helps speed research and certainly it
        yields better content.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">You must provide us with either screen
        shots or the project itself to us to prove to us that you
        are indeed doing what you claim to be doing. As for the
        website, give us a URL to your site instead and we will
        review it. It is much help to give us some details on the
        stuff you send us as we talk about your project so that
        we are more aware of what it will be like.</font></p>

        Do NOT give your username or password to ANYONE. What we
        ARE responsible for is keeping you at home and ensuring
        that you are happy. That is out ONLY responsibility. The
        rest is yours. Of course though, all of that is very
