Sonic 2 Questions / Answers</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deviance forwarded some
questions he asked a former level designer for Sonic 2. This list
of questions and answers have been compiled onto this page.
Although, originally requested for me to not mention who the
person is, people pretty much already know who it is by now --
non other than Brenda Ross. This may posibly answer any questions
you have.</font></p>

<hr noshade>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. There is what appears to a
crocodile&#146;s head on the desert zone screenshot, could you
tell us what the rest of crocodile looked like?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I don&#146;t
remember anything like that. You&#146;ll have to send me the
image so I can see it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. What other badniks were on
the desert zone, and what did they do?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I had
nothing to do with creating enemies or characters, so I don&#146;t
remember, I&#146;m sorry. I would only Grab images to use as
placeholders when showing my art in various stages.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. If you could would you
recreate the desert and woods zone?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I think they
would look great in 3D. But no, I&#146;m happy with what I do now
for a living, which is running a few websites and writing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Could you explain the type of
equipment used to program the games?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Nope. You&#146;ll
have to ask a programmer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. What kind of computers were
you using? <br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">We used a
Japanese proprietary system called a digitizer. All the employees
at Sega Japan used them. Basically you did the work on a grid
like system, and you saw the results on a second screen, then you&#146;d
have a TV screen set up for color correction.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Which operating system was it
running under (UNIX, DOS, etc.)<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. What kind of compiler was the
game compiled under (C, ASM, etc.)<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Explain the &quot;synthesizers&quot;
some more.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. How were graphics for the
game generated and what programs did you use to generate them?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">See question
#5.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Explain the process of how a
level was designed: from concept to final product.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">That&#146;s
a question for Yasuhara, The game designer for Sonic.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. How far into the design did
desert zone see? Was a boss for that level ever created?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I think that
Dust Hill was completed entirely, and woods zone was mostly done.
Once you have the initial key pieces, you can go fairly far with
building a level.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Could you make a rough
sketch of how the level layout was?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">God, no.
Sorry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Why were these two zones
ditched?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">The last
artists added to the team were myself, and a guy named Craig
Stitt. Craig did the Hidden palace zone, which made it in. I came
along later to create the desert/winter dust hill zone and the
woods zone. There was a massive amount of pressure to finish this
game, and my zones, and perhaps one others of Craig&#146;s, if I
remember correctly, had to be scrapped. We were all upset,
naturally, but that&#146;s the nature of the game industry. 50%
of your stuff is likely not to be used.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. Why would there be a
crocodile in a desert?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I don&#146;t
think there was one. It&#146;s been 9 years, so I might not
remember.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Well, some people suspect
that the screen shot was not an actual screenshot. Rather, it was
an image created using a computer and some paint program. What do
you have to say about this?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">It was a
real level.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. Was Dust Hill Zone ever
completed? If not, at least how far was it?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I think it
was completed. I couldn&#146;t have gone on to create the woods
zone if it hadn&#146;t been. They just didn&#146;t have time to
add it to the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Was Dust Hill Zone planned
to be put back into the game? Reason asking is because I notice
how the Oil Ocean Zone music changed for level selection 03 -
supposedly to get the correct music to match the beta music.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. Was Wood Zone ever
completed? If not, at least how far was it?<br>
About half way done, I&#146;d guess. Or a bit more.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. What other objects were in
the desert and woods zone? There are plenty of empty object slots
in the binary, so we figure that plenty of it once had data there.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">The desert
zone was as you see in that image, with cactus and assorted
plants. It was designed to have a palette change, which turned
the sand into snow, and you&#146;d have a winter scene. We had to
be fairly ingenious with such a limited palette. In the winter
zone, (that&#146;s what I call it), instead of cactus, I had
created Christmas trees, which I thought looked kinda cool. I
remember the woods zone having pink flowers somewhere. Hey, I am
a girl&#133; heh.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. What was Dust Hill like was
it huge, what was the landscape like in general, etc.?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">I think half
above ground, and half below. It would depend on the level. Sonic
would travel through the sand or snow tunnel, depending on which
palette was being used.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. Was Dust Hill related to Oil
Ocean in any way with the hot sun and all?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Nope.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23. There is another zone,
referred to as the fifth lost zone, the 01 zone, some think its
emerald hill zone act 3, do you know anything about this?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A (means I
have no idea)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. Do you still have any
materials in used in development, like layouts, graphics, etc. in
the &#147;synthesizer&#148; formats or any other formats.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">No, It was
all left at Sega years ago.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. Do you have any paper
materials like a design spec for the levels or any level sketches
you can show us.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">See answer #24.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. If you can, can you explain
why sonic is off center in that desert zone screenshot.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">He was just
dropped in for placement for the marketing folks. It was totally
random and has nothing to do with any real gameplay.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. Did the desert, winter, and
woods zones have specific names?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Desert was
dust hill. I don&#146;t remember the rest.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28. Is Mystic Cave Zone in any
way related to the desert zone, because in the beta be have has
Mystic Cave Zone play when Dust Hill Zone is selected.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29. Was there ever any fire
sprite in the desert zone because there&#146;s been a fire sprite
found hidden in a Sonic 2 ROM image.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30. Was there ever a Genocide
City Zone even in development?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">That sounds
familiar, but I can&#146;t be sure.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31. Did Dust Hill Zone have any
music, if so did it stay in Sonic 2 final&#146;s sound test?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32. Was time travel a concept
intended for Sonic 2 ever?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33. Did Wood Zone have original
music, or was it a time travel zone (assuming that theory is true)<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34. Do you have any screenshots
of any of the lost levels?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35. Is there the possibility of
you finishing the levels in a ROM and anonymously releasing it to
the sonic community?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">No. I could
get sued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36. There is speculation that
the boss to the desert zone was a flying pyramid, any truth in
this.<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">There was no
boss designed for that level, if I remember correctly. If so, I
never saw it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37. Do you know anything about
Genocide City?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">38. Was act 1 outdoors, with act
2 indoors of the desert zone? (like Sandopolis from Sonic 3)<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">N/A</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">39. What is the deal with the
unusual ring positions in that desert zone shot?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">They&#146;re
unusual because I put them there. Lol. I&#146;m not a game
designer. They were there for temporary placement only.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40. If you were asked to
complete these missing zones for the Sonic Compilation on DC,
would you do it?<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">No. I&#146;m
way too busy now. Also, as I said, there are legal issues. Sonic
is very well protected. I think for a while there, that
particular character kept Sega of America from going under. He
did generate a massive amount of money, didn&#146;t he?</font></p>
