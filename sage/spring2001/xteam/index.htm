        slow, I mean REALLY slow. Well Rick is kind of busy until
        about August, until then I'm in charge. Well firts
        thing's first. Members of the X-Team if you are reading
        this we are regrouping the team. If you want to stay on
        the team and are going to work on it please contact
        Chris, on the matter (email later in this update). On a
        similar note newbies are also welcome to join the team,
        you can contact the same people about this.<br>
        Secondly, our first project is going to be started all
        over from scratch. We have yet to figure out what we will
        do exactly, but the new projects name is Project: Flight.<br>
        Well I think that's all for today. Oh and by the way
        since I'm in charge right now, I'm going to try harder to
        update this page.<br>
        And I'll be posting how the regrouping is going.</font><p><font
