<p><font color="#000080" size="5"><strong>SSRG Exclusive Sonic
Custom Levels CD</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">This project is in the works currently. This CD
will offer 100 custom 'exclusive' levels for Sonic 1, 2, and 3K.
These levels will not be avalible for download off the internet
however. These levels will only be avalible on this CD. The CD
cost is planned at $15. This is 'extremely' cheap for the amount
of work put forth to make all these levels. That's where YOU come
in. I am trying to get the Sonic community involved a great deal
here. You will receive 15 cents for each level you submit once
the CD is complete and we get the money to pay you. However, it's
a long way from complete. If everyone participates though, it
will happen much sooner. Once we get enough levels, we will
immediatly close offerings for levels. If we don't think your
level is up to correct standards that the public would generally
want, don't get upset. Just fix it up -- or you could have us fix
it up if you want, either way. You must however agree that any
levels you submit will be for profit reasons and therefore,
should not be avalible to the public outside this CD -- this
includes the internet, putting them on a disk of your own, etc.
Participating in making levels for this CD will not only give you
your profit of 15 cents per every level you send in, but it will
also get you a free copy of this CD.</font></p>
