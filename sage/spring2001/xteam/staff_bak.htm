        Andy is the original site maintainer and also the owner
        of the Emulation Zone in which SSRG is hosted on. When a
        lot of events were going in the Sonic scene such as the
        Sonic 2 beta, Sonic ROM hacking, and several other
        findings, the Andy started the SOnic Stuff Research group
        which allowed yhese findings to go public and to create a
        new Sonic hacking based scene. Although, not the
        maintainer anymore, he still comes back every so often to
        fix up some things and to do things for SSRG.</font></p>

        Damian (that's me) is the current SSRG maintainer.
        Although, could be considered the &quot;president&quot;
        of SSRG, I still consder myself at Andy's level of
        ownership and managing. When Andy got a lot lesser time
        to work on SSRG and Emulation Zone at the same time, he
        desided to hand over SSRG to somebody else by vote.
        Surprisinly, my vote was higher, so here I am, still
        maintaining and making the best out of SSRG.</font></p>

        Wiseman is the guy we depend on to translate the page
        into Spanish. He has also done a translation of Tom's
        Sonic Hacking pages. This is the type of guy who will do
        a lot of hard work to make sure SSRG is looking good not
        only to the English speaking people, but also to Spanish
        speaking people!</font></p>

        This is the guy who made the big SSRG boom with his
        famous site, Secrets of Sonic the Hedgehog. This site's
        purpose was to release many secrets in which some people
        didn't know about and to release the mysteries that have
        yet to be solved. To this day, Sonic fans of all kinds
        are releasing secret info. This popular routine wouldn't
        have happened without Andre Dirk. Although, he doesn't
        maintain/own the site anymore, he will never be forgotten.</font></p>

        Knuckles is now the new maintainer of Secrets of Sonic
        the Hedgehog. He is keeping the page alive after it took

        Secrets of Sonic the Hedgehog is even more popular than
        before with it's new sections and features.</font></p>

        This guy put together Area 51 before the Sonic 2 beta was
        out, but shotly after the beta was released to the
        public, this site as to many other sites got a big boom.
        It contained a lot of useful info on the beta and other
        Sonic games as it still does today. Then Andy Wolan
        talked to him and dragged him on into SSRG. Now he has a
        well dedicated site that even more of the world can see!</font></p>

        staff member of SSRG for his contributes. He isn't a PC
        type person, but when it comes to Mac, he is someone we
