<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Be afraid, be very afraid. Originally started
out as a way of taking the p*ss out of one of my mates. No prizes for guessing
his name. No proper storyline, graphics that could have been drawn by a
five year old and sounds that either blew up your speakers or were too
quiet to hear. Lots of 'in' jokes that you probably won't get. In summery,
download it, play it, laugh at it, <strike>delete</strike> archive it.

Adventure 2</u></b>
<p>Oh no, not again. By this time I was enjoying making the game so much
that I had to make another. So here it is. Much the same as Brett's Adventure,
but longer, and with some sort of storyline. You might actually enjoy playing
this one, but I doubt it.</td>

in the future, for some more stuff see the demos page.
