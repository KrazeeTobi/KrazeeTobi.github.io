    The blue streak returns again, ready to tackle Eggman and his robots. Definitely the
    quickest of all the three, but also the least versatile. He will find several areas
    inaccesible and must find new routes around them. That's not to say he's not learned
    anything since last time. He has a special 'Air Spin Attack' move, allowing him to shoot
    forwards at high speeds, aiding him in longer jumps and giving him automatic acceleration.</td>

    Having missed his first chance to help Sonic back in Sonic Robo Blast I, he is more than
    ready to assist Sonic this time around. While nowhere near as fast as Sonic, he has his
    flying ability, which will help him over longer jumps and reach new areas.</td>

    Having played a minor role in stopping Eggman from the original Sonic Robo Blast, he
    returns to put Eggman out of commission once and for all. While he lacks Sonic's speed, he
    is faster than Tails and retains his climbing and gliding skill. </td>
