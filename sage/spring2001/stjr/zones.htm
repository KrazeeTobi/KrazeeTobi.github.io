GREENFLOWER ZONE -<br>
Considering Eggman's invasion has just started, the zone is relatively free of any robots,
but that still doesn't mean you have time to enjoy the lush landscape. Features
waterfalls, hidden caves and plenty of fauna.<br>

TECHNO HILL ZONE -<br>
This was once a beatiful landscape, but has been mostly tainted by Eggman's chemical
factory, pumping out slime. The factory was abandoned after his unsuccessful invasion, but
has since come back to life! Watch out for the machines inside the factory, and the
chemical dumping which is taking place outside.<br>

DEEP SEA ZONE -<br>
Sonic, Tails and Knuckles stumble across some ruins, which have been flooded, partly by
nature and partly by Eggman digging away for the Chaos Emeralds. Be wary of water traps
which can threaten to drown you!<br>

MINE MAZE ZONE -<br>
Following Eggman's trail from the Deep Sea Zone, you come across one of his new mines.
Sadly, Eggman is not happy with your presence and the mining robots have turned their
attention to you. Watch out for some more unstable parts of the mine and the robots.<br>

ROCKY MOUNTAIN ZONE -<br>
Emerging from the mines, you come across a huge mountain. While Sonic must find a way to
scale this, Tails and Knuckles can use their abilities to the fullest. Be careful not to
enjoy the scenery too much, as there are plenty of falling platforms and obstacles.<br>
<img src="question.gif" width="320" height="200" alt="question.gif (1735 bytes)"><br>
RED VOLCANO ZONE -<br>
Finding Eggman's robots entering the volcano, you follow them to investigate what's
happening. Rather than worrying about Eggman's traps here, you should be more concerned
with the deadly lava, that threatens to rise without warning.<br>

DARK CITY ZONE -<br>
You've finally reached the heart of Eggman's operations, however the robot denizens are
less than pleased to see you. Eggman's security is pretty tight, and will certaintely slow
you down as you try to board the Doomship.<br>
<img src="question.gif" width="320" height="200" alt="question.gif (1735 bytes)"><br>
DOOMSHIP ZONE -<br>
Now Sonic has entered the ship, and he must make his way to the control room to divert the
course to the Eggrock, where he can stop Eggman's plans. But first, he has the small
matter of dealing with the security system.<br>

EGGROCK ZONE -<br>
You've finally arrived at the Eggrock Zone. Who knows what's in here? Except for a few
surprises, maybe.<br>
