What I find funny is that you have the audacity to give Glaber a challenge and think you could win, yet you've never been in an OLDC, ever. Now I get why people dislike you... And yes, I'm against you. So what, you need to change your ways if you're going to thrive in any sort of community. Though, I understand that you probably won't ever change, given the many chances you'd been given from myself and others. Anywho, good chat overall. But do you think you should take a step back or two for a while and think through your actions?


Let me guess... SoupMob.
Hahahhahahah, silly me. LMFAO you mad.

That I do know. IMO I honestly care less about the SoupMob fued and whatnot.


Then again, the fuck did you do to not get shit on? Before you bring up the contrary, I read the chat logs. Let me tell you that most of the stuff SoupMob did is actually unbelievable and harmful...


I care honestly. I should tell people what stuff are and what stuff aren't, because I can't handle 3 server bans. Get those nuclear alarm bells in here...


God, I love the new Internet...


People couldn't tell my off-colour humor without using shitty attitude. And yet, here you are.


No, you're a very sensitive child.


Off-colour humor, one-sided fights and contradiction, laziness, attitude, etc...


Yes, it was. You'd see a bunch on SoupMob pissing their pants all day being pissed at a Moderator's word.

Put it this way, SoupMob. You're going to be incapable of thriving in many communities.

I don't care if someone finds this and leaks it from one of my folders on my Gitsite. 

The world needs to know about the fact that some people just can't take criticism.
