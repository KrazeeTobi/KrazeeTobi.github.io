<b>The Mettle Sonic Interview!</b> - 10-10-98</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Thanks for allowing us from Sonic HQ to do this interview with you, Mettle Sonic. 

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> No problem.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> How far are you in the development of Sonic RPG?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> So far I've only got 3 1/2 levels done. The first being 
Knothole; the second being the Wolfpack camp; the third being an 
ice cap level; and the last some sorta tunnel. I will get more though,
lots more...

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Are you looking for anyone to help with the full version?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> yeah, if you've seen the demo you've seen how pathetic 
the backgrounds look so I'm looking for someone to do that for me, I also 
need someone to make music for the game since all of the music is just a 
bunch of midis I got from variouse sites, but what I really need is 
someone to make a better webpage for me. Mine really sux.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> What do you have planned for those new levels?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> I don't know yet, I'm sorta working as I go along, 
trying to build up a storyline. But I basicly want to go through most 
of Mobius. And I could too, since there's enough room to make 99 maps.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Do you have any parts of the storyline planned yet?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> Some, but not a lot, since I want to incorporate things 
from all of the diffarent Sonic universes.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Which universe do you expect to be dominant in the story?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> Probably the comic one (Archie), but I intend to mix 
a lot of the Sega stuff with it too. Like the Little Planet and Metal
Sonic. I won't use much of the Fleetway though, since I dont know much
about it.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Any AoSTH?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> Most likely not since I absolutly hated it!!! But I will 
use the SatAM.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Which characters will be playable?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> So far I've got Mighty, Sonic, Tails and Ray but I will 
have much more. I'm working on Espio and Knuckles right now. I basicly 
intend to have most of the characters but unfortunatly I won't be able 
to do Bunnie or Vector.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Why not?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> Its basicly a size problem, both of Bunnie's ears would 
have to be down and look really messed up in order to fit on the screen 
and Vector is too tall also.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Are you drawing the characters?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> Yeah, most of them anyway.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Do you have any ideas on how you might differentiate the 
characters? (different moves/attacks, etc.)

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> Yeah, all of the characters already have different moves 
and attacks.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> How did you create Sonic RPG?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> What do you mean.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Well, how did you find the game engine that plays it, how 
did you make the .rpg file, and how did you make the graphics?

<p><b>MettleSonic:</b> Oh, I used a little program called O.H.R.RPG.C.E. to make 
the game and most of the graphics I made myself or imported from 
the actual Sega games.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Where can it be found?  How did you hear of it?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> I found it by chance. I got it bookmarked but I don't 
know the site by heart. I'm gonna put it on my webpage when I get the 
chance.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> I thought your music choices were great.  How did you 
decide on them?  Will O.H.R.RPG.C.E. let you use different music 
for different levels?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> I just downloaded lots of diffarent midis and decided 
which fit the levels best. And yes, I can change the music whenever 
I want.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> There were a lot of midis used for battle sequences.  Are 
those randomized or is the song chosen according to which enemies you
are fighting?

<p><b>Mettle Sonic:</b> All of them are set up specifically for different battle
formations.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Any estimate for a final release date?

<p><b>MettleSonic:</b> Not yet since I only started the game about a month ago.
Of course it will go faster if I get some help.

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> Last question, how did you first become a Sonic fan?

<p><b>MettleSonic:</b> When I was over at my uncle's place and we rented a 
Genesis with Sonic 1. I loved it!!!

<p><b>Sonic HQ:</b> I guess this concludes our interview.  Thanks again!
