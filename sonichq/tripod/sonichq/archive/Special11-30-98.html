Hi, this is Knux Lee here with my report on Sonic fandom in Malaysia
and well,
sorta includes Singapore in certain aspects.

<p><b>Malaysia Sonic Fandom on GAMES</b>

<p>I can say, many love the Sonic games. However, not many own Megadrives /
Genesises or Saturns. They instead play the Nintendo Sonic hacks. Some
of
these hacks include ones starring Mario. Get the picture? Mario running
as
fast as Sonic? I believe the 'Hidden Sonic Secrets' page has a rom of
this
but on Megadrive I believe. Also, the Nintendo version of Sonic has
lousy
graphics, as Nintendo and it's clones only are 8-bit machines. And these
people that like the games, sadly, aren't real fans and don't give a
care
to who Sonic really is. Only a few do. Also, the console that rules the
market here is probally the Playstation. I have met very few that own
Saturns
and only about THREE who own Genesises or Megadrive 2s. Also, there are
silly games like 'Sonic and Knuckles 5' which actually is just Sonic 1
where
(I believe) you can play Knuckles. And also, very few know about the
Dream-
cast except the hardcore gamers who have the money to buy magazines,
us, the
internet sonic fans, and the other gamers who have internet.

<p><b>Malaysia Sonic Fandom on CARTOONS</b>

<p>Our satellite tv, ASTRO links to the (Malaysian) Disney Channel which
shows
both the Sonic cartoons, AoStH and Satam. Because of this, many like the
Sonic cartoons but as the series is not completed, know little about
Sonic
and therefore aren't real fans. Sonic however, is 3 times a day and
therefore
is watched by those who watch cartoon after cartoon. (Like me, when I
go to
my grandparent's house a little south. I don't have ASTRO!)

<b><p>Malaysian Sonic Fandom on COMICS</b>

<p>Sonic sells pretty well here, as when I visited our capital, Kuala
Lumpur
last year, not one shop of the tens I visited had a copy of Sonic. All
said
"Sorry, sold out." Here up north in Kedah, we have very few comic
stores.
Therefore, I get my comics from Popular Bookstore, a large bookstore
with
branches everywhere. (even singapore and etc.) Comics are quite hard to
find as not many bookstores import comics. Comic bookstores also import
more of the DC, Image and so on comics. And also, those who read the
comics
tend to clash with those who only watched the cartoons. Note : All this
info
is on Archie, not Fleetway. I haven't seen ONE Fleetway comic here..)

<p><b>Malaysian Sonic Fandom on MISC</b>

<p>Well, I don't know what to put under MISC but all I can say is, the main
factor that draws people to Sonic fandom is the games. Then slowly when
they
see the cartoons, it's even kewler! Then they venture into the Internet
Sonicverse and meet us, after finding so many friends with similiar
interests,
they slowly develop more like for Sonic and then WHAM! They are fans.
Those
who DON'T venture into the Internet somehow lose interest after seeing
other
stuff. I lost my only fellow Sonic fan due to whaddya know, Hanson.
(&%$*^!)

<p>Summerize...

<p>Sonic Fandom is small in Malaysia and therefore must be watered and
fertilized with the Dreamcast and Sonic Adventure! Then, it will rule the
world!
