Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/19980929165700/http://207.155.180.70/">Sega X</a> reports that that the Sonic Team will make Burning Rangers 2 after Sonic Adventure. After Burning Rangers 2 (which should be done by summer of 1999), the Sonic Team will turn to a new project: Sonic RPG. Now this doesn't fit what the IGN sites are reporting, Next-Generation and IGN DC both already have Sonic RPG as a confirmed game (in other words, already in development). So which report should we believe? You decide for yourself for now.

<b>Sonic Newsgroup Summary.</b> - Vector 10:13pm CST, 9-25-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
I'm filling in for Swifty in this newsgroup report. He can't write this one because of Hurricane Georges.
<p>Good News for Sat-AM fans!  Benjamin Hurst, a writer for the Sonic Sat-AM series, is trying to bring the cancelled 3rd season storyline to Sonic fans.  Here are 3 quotes from him:
<p><i>It is my dream to bring the story lines which were left unfinished in the second season to their final conclusion - and I'm working now to bring that to pass - though it is an uphill road and I'm afraid my chances of success are slim. Nonetheless, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Believe me, I want to see this as much as all of those here who share the love of Satam Sonic.
<p>... I'm not trying to revive the Satam series - I am thinking more along the lines of a feature film - or direct to video movie featuring the Satam characters - and completing the storylines developed in the second season.
<p>There are no third season scripts.  The only thing in existence is the sketch that I did of the third season.  There are many twists and turns that I shouldn't disclose, just in case my efforts toward continuing these character and story lines is successful.  But, if I can't get anything moving on this project - I will reveal them or possibly write them into a "profic" as it was called by someone.</i>
<p>Someone had posted a suggestion that, if Ben Hurst's attempts were unsuccessful, he could put the story on the internet as a fanfic. (He was an official writer, hence the word "profic")
<p>How old is Tails? The Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles plush toys are sought by many Sonic fans.  One who is fortunate enough to have a Tails plush toy wrote a reponse to a message that described Tails' age as 8.  Here is part of the response:
<p><i>Hmmm, yeah but on the back of the box for the Tails plush toy it says, "Hi! I'm Tails! I'm almost 5!"</i>
<p>Another person wrote:
<p><i><center>Sonic - 16<br>Tails - 8<br>Knuckles - 15<br></center>
<p>Any person that has played Sonic Jam will know that these are the true ages.</i>
<p>In the Sat-AM continuity (and the Archie one that was based on it), he's 10, and Fleetway puts him in his mid-teens, from what I have read. AoSTH and the plush toy maker placed Tails at 4 and a half years. So did several gaming magazines that included character profiles - which may have come from SEGA - in their Sonic game previews.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about Tails' age, with 4 diffrent ages coming from different sources.
<p>Just how does Sonic eat chili dogs in a world of anthropomorphic animals?  Newsgroup theories ranged from vegetarian hot dogs to non-sentient animals.  My favorite:
<p><i>Anyone stop to think maybe hedgehogs don't eat meat?</i>
<p>However, one question was never brought up.  Since when have hot dogs contained anything that could be considered meat?
<p>I'll turn the reporting back to Zifei now.

If you have been wondering what's wrong with Artail Productions lately, wonder no more. Here's what Mike Reyes (Artie) said about his page:
<p><i>Well, here's the deal: When the site first went down, it was because Mighty (The owner of the server, yes, this site WAS actually hosted on mightyfox.com) quit his job at Stratos Internet (Where the server was hosted), and got a job at a newISP. It was down while he was trying to negotiate the conditions that the server would be hosted under there. It STILL hasn't come back up (The login & password thing you've been seeing is because the IP that artail.com used is now pointing to something else at Stratos). As of right now, I plan to drop artail.com alltogether, and just move my site back.
</i><p>So, in just a little while (a few days? or weeks?), you'll be able to goto <a href="https://web.archive.org/19980925220600/http://artail.simplenet.com/">Artail Productions</a> again.

Alrighty, Swifty here. There seems to be a cry for "plush" on the

<p>From: <a href="mailto:lukeld@triton.net">Lucas</a><br><i>

Would someone please tell me where I could get a tails plush toy I have been looking for one for 1 year! If anyone has any information pleas hit reply to group on this letter. if someone is willing to by one and send it to me I will offer a full refund on the merchandise.</i>

<p>There were more on this subject when I logged to the

NewsGroup, but it just dissapeared. Here's something else I found in the NewsGroup. A cute picture of Sonic and Sally in the distant future when they both are King and Queen. A very neat pic...until a little girl disrupts the fun. Probably the only version of the story of the "Birds and the Bees" to the Freedom Fighters. Nothing to get offended of.

<b>Sonic Comic Sales Go Down!</b> - Zifei 7:40 pm CST, 9-18-98</td></tr>



<tr><td colspan="2">



I was hoping for some good news to go along with the relaunch of Sonic News Press of Sonic HQ. But, I get this. Sonic the Hedgehog direct comic sales have gone down again! This time the comic sales went down by 5.2%, this means that Sonic went down 12.4% in direct sales over the last 6 issues! But, Sonic #64 is still the best selling comic of Archie in the month of August and is still at 206th place in direct sales compared to other comics. Now for some good news, total sales (direct sales + newsstands + subscriptions) for Sonic #64 went up again! Sonic is now nearing that magical 100,000 copies mark!
