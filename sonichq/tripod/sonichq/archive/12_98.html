Sega of Japan will release a VGA cable for the Dreamcast sometime in January 1999. The cable would allow the Dreamcast to use a computer monitor as a display. Monitors will allow better graphics. Sonic Adventure will be one of the first games to support this cable link.

Here's a bit of interesting information regarding the first Sonic Adventure add-on file you could download form www.Dricas.com from SegaNet:
<p><i>Turns out that the first use of the modem in conjunction with
                       Sonic Adventure will be to download a limited-edition file that
                       decorates a pine tree in the first town of the game! More
                       specifically, it decorates the tree with Christmas ornaments to
                       go along with the holiday season; the file will be available for
                       download from Sonic Adventure's website only during
                       Christmas. 

                       <p>Says an excited Sonic Team, "Let's begin experiencing new
                       possibilities, connecting Sonic Adventure to the Internet and
                       enhancing the game!" The Christmas tree file will be
                       downloaded into your VMS unit and stored there for
                       safekeeping.</i> 
<p>I have also recieved other hints saying that you could actually download new levels from the net! Also someone from a Sega board suggested that maybe there will be muti-player mode once the game gets here.

Reviewers of Sonic Adventure from Famitsu Magazine (which gave Zelda a 40/40 and SA a 38/40) talked about their review of the game:
<p><i>The reviewers don't want to give a game that's released so
                       early in a system's life-span such a perfect score; they are
                       sure Sonic Team and the rest of the Dreamcast developers
                       can do much better in future games. The reviewers also
                       commented that if they had reviewed Sonic Adventure
                       before Zelda, Zelda would of been ranked much lower.</i>
<p>Well...ok, I'll take that as a "we're sorry that Sonic Adventure did not get a perfect 40/40."

has it
that Sega is thinking of making a game of it. Yes a game, based off a
TV show,
which is based off a game. The show is to air in April of 1999. Another tidbit is
there is to be <i>a new song</i> each episode. Based off the pictures of the

Lien just recieved a letter from Manny Galan, the current penciller for Knuckles the Echidna comics. Here's some interesting quotes from the letter:
<p><i>
     I'm very touched that so many people care if I leave the book or not. One tends to forget
     that people are actually reading this stuff. After awhile it becomes a job and you forget
     people are actually consuming your product.

     <p>I was so moved by some of the letters particularly from the
     younger kids that I almost re thought leaving. But unfortunately after budgeting my time, I
     realise that it would be impossible. I've recently moved and married
     and Ta-Da! was surprised to find out I'm going to be a father!!! Can you believe that? I'm
     having my own baby Knuckles! Ha! Ha! After the baby comes I will really have no extra
     time. But for now I can tell you that for the
     forseeable future Knuckles fans (the greatest people on Earth) can look forward to seing my
     work on Knux back up stories and I'll also be doing the covers, and
     as I stated before my 2 last issues which will likely appear in the mid to late thirties, I hope!</i>
<p>Congrats from Sonic HQ, Manny! And we wish you well. Steven Butler, the current Sonic artist, will take over the main pencilling for Knuckles after Manny "leaves" (he will still draw backup stories for a while).

Ken Penders yeasterday on his message board made a post about the future of Knuckles comics, including Knuckles: Twenty Years Later:
<p><i>KNUCKLES: TWENTY YEARS LATER will more likely appear in SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #11 or 12. It
was pushed back at my request, so I could get the regular series ahead of schedule so I wouldn't be
rushing through this. It is NOT an alternate reality story. It definitely does chronicle what happens much
later in Knuckles' life. Despite knowing what this future shows, readers will still find that the path to the
future in the regular series will be a most surprising one.
<p>Chances are SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #11, however, will feature the FEMALE FURRIES issue, where
Sally resolves the Antoine situation once and for all with her father, Julie-Su learns a bit of her past,
Hershey shows why she's just possibly the most dangerous agent under Geoffrey's command, Bunnie
deals with her situation and Lupe stars in a sequel to the current 3-parter she's featured in the latest issues
of SONIC.

<p>MIGHTY is featured in a 3-part adventure beginning in KNUCKLES #26, in which he details his first
meeting with SONIC and RAY THE SQUIRREL. There's also a couple of major surprises tossed in,
especially for NACK and TAILS fans.

<p>ESPIO gets the solo-star treatment for 3-issues in the back-ups starting with KNUCKLES #30. Chances
are you'll see Constable Remington and Julie-Su solo adventures as well.

<p>You'll get an overview of Guardian history along with plenty of other surprises in KNUCKLES #25.

<p>Rob o' the Hedge, Antoine and General D'Coolette are featured players in the RETURN TO ALBION
storyline slated for KNUCKLES #33 through 35. (I'm still debating with myself whether or not to go with
FAMILY OBLIGATIONS as the overall story title.)</i>
<p>Nothing's really new here except that Knuckles: Twenty Years Later super special is being pushed back. That leads us to ponder what will be the filler. I mean, Archie didn't do a very good job with past fillers (Sonic #51-#52, #57-#61)...

<b>Where Are The Chaotix?</b> - Zifei 3:47pm CST, 12-8-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Ken Penders, the writer of Knuckles the Echidna comics, had this to say when our own, WB, asked him why the Choatix doesn't make much of an appearance anymore:
<p><i>One of the problems I have with KNUCKLES is too much story and not enough pages to tell it, so
somebody is always getting the short shrift. In this case, I'd have to agree the Chaotix haven't exactly
taken center stage. They do, however show up a bit more in the DARK ALLIANCE storyline taking place
in KNUCKLES #22 through #24. However, it's the KNUCKLES: THE FIRST DATE storyline in #26
through #28 where the Chaotix figure more prominently. Not only that, but they'll be taking center stage in
the back-up stories that begin in KNUCKLES #26.
<p>Incidentally, not only do we have RAY THE SQUIRREL finally making his debut in KNUCKLES #26, but
we have a major surprise for NACK fans as well. </i>
<p>Most of this stuff we already reported about a month or two ago, but the Nack thing is new. Last time I checked, Nack is still with Snively and bunch.

I got this from an e-mail from <a href="mailto:katharin@ellensburg.com">Michael Stearns</a>:
<p><i>Oh, as for that music, I talked to Alessandro [Sanasi], it turns out the "arcade" music is actually
from a CD, totally unrelated to anything, produced by a company called "arcade."  So it's an
"Arcade CD," and we all just got really confused.  Strange, but it makes sense, considering all
those songs about Sonic and Tails and tails isn't even in the game!!  Also, I'm afraid it wasn't
released on any home system, of that I am certain..</i>
<p>Apparently, Desert Dodge Zone was from the SEGASonic arcade game (Koryan, who lives in
Japan, composed it and listed it as a song from SEGASonic), while 'Sonic Electronic', 'King of the
Ring', 'They Call Me Sonic', and 'Sonic & Tails' (which all contained lyrics) were from the music
CD.  I don't know for certain where Metropolis Trance Zone came from, but I think it was also
from the CD, because that's how the MP3 was listed in the Sonic Corner's MP3 section.
<p><i>As for other info...the scanner IS in order, I've got it all figured out!  I'm going to recreate the entire
article from EGM in HTML, (I like htmling, what can I say?) once I scan the pictures this week.. 
(College slows things down soooooo much!!)  Once again, sorry it's taking so long.  Xmas break is

With all the talk centered around Dreamcast, there's still some hope left for the Sega Saturn:
<p><i>Majesco, the company responsible for the re-design and distribution of the
 Genesis 3, will begin manufacturing and distributing the Sega Saturn early in
 1999. The Saturn's US installed user base is estimated at 1.5 million, but if
 their expected sales of the Genesis 3 (1-2 million units) for '99 suggest
 numbers for Saturn sales, this could be quickly changing. The price of the
 system will be a mere $49.</i>
<p>The games will sale only for $15. Now here's the better news: 
<p><i>Majesco will also be re-releasing the Sega Game Gear at the low low price of
 $29.</i>
<p>The Saturn had 3 Sonic games and the Game Gear had over 10. With those cheap prices, I'm sure you can have them for your next birthday or something.

As far as I and about everyone else know, the Dreamcast will be launched in United States and Europe on September the first, but that may change according to this quote:
<p><i>My
                       Importer, Microplay, was present at the Nashville show and
                       they told me not to buy the DC because it will be released in
                       April. They aren't the only ones either. I have a good friend
                       who runs 3 local Software ect. and he also told me the same
                       thing.</i>
<p>Now Bernie Stolar has promised countless times that Sonic Adventure will be an launch title no matter what. Wouldn't it be great to have the whole summer to play Sonic Adventure (rumors right now are saying 120 hours rush straight through game)? Of course, until an official announcement, count this as a rumor.

<b>Sonic Adventure Delayed?!</b> - Zifei 3:27pm CST, 12-2-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Rumors are flying in the Japanese retail stores that Sonic Adventure will be delayed again, here's a quote from Gaming-Age:
<p><i>Without a doubt the most anticipated title for the Dreamcast,
                       Sonic Adventure, is rumored to be delayed to January of
                       1999. Some retail shops in Japan have refused pre-orders because
                       they've heard there is a possible delay on the game to
                       January of next year. However Sega is hard at work 24
                       hours a day hoping to complete the game for its current
                       release date, December 23. </i>
<p>Most likely Sonic Adventure will <i>not</i> be delayed. Why? Because Sega today announced that another great game launching on the same day as SA would be delayed. If SA would also be delayed, Sega would only have 1 great and 6 so so Dreamcast games in time for the shopping season.
