<br><b>Although we're the best (notice that I didn't say the fastest, but soon we will be!) source on the whole Internet for all kinds of Sonic related news (yeah, ONLY Sonic related news), there are quiet a few others out there. Here's some that I think are pretty good Sonic news pages. BTW, if you have a page that belongs down here, please email <a href="mailto:zw@rocketmail.com">me</a> the link, and I'll put it up.</b>

<p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~MaraRe/news2.html">Mara-Re's Sonicverse News Room</a> - Although a very simple design, it's one of my favorite Sonic news places...it's the only site that sometimes report news faster (I mean a lot faster) than us.

<p><a href="http://kedziek.simplenet.com/news/board/index.htm">tSf News Board</a> - An excellent place if you want a combination of Sega nd Sonic news on the run.

<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Realm/4631/news.html">Tiara's News Page</a> - If you're looking for Sonic gaming news, go here. Just beware of the background color.
