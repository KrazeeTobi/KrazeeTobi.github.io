<font face=garamond>
This is a simple little directory of my files stored at dragonwind.fsn.net.<br>
Fsn.Net doesn't allow you to look at my directories<br>( In fact, it doesn't allow ME to look at my directories ),<br>
so I've made one myself on a seperate server. <br>If you remember rat.org/sonic, it was set up pretty much like this one.<br>
The directories I've made are pretty self-explainitory,<br> but I'll describe them so no one gets confused.<br>
The files themselves may descriptions too, if I decide to put them up.<br>
Enjoy the files..<br>
