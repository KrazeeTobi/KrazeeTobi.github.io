<HTML><BODY><PRE>Used to be here, now he'd dead
just a sweet song in my head
can't think of nothing instead
sweet
songs in my head 
sweet
songs in my head
nothing ventured nothing gained
just a sweet song I've explained
 he's gone so I'm in pain
sweet
songs in my head
sweet 
songs in my head
all the music that we sang 
all the doorbells that you rang
all those people that were hanged
sweet 
songs in my head
sweet 
songs in my head
all those clothes that I did sort
can't come up with one retort
now I've gone to the airport
sweet
songs in my head
sweet
songs in my head
sweet 
songs in my head 
sweet
songs in my head
I used to know him now he's dead
just a stranger in my head
Now I think I'll go to bed
sweet 
songs in my head
sweet
songs in my head
sweet
sweet
sweet 
songs in my head
sweet 
songs in my head.
Sweet-By Crimson Kitty
