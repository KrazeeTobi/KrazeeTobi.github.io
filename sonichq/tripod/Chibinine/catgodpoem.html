<PRE>
A cat stood on a crate and looked over the ground.
Was in nighttime, the right time, he made a loud sound
That was heard by every cat in town
They came and gathered by this one cat
Little did they know why they came
This cat was the same
as them all.
Wrong, my friends, I am sure
This cat is different, this cat is pure
genious, yes, genious, and all the cats of the world indure
his speech, and trust me, 
he does it all through telepathy.
He says, " am the cat god, the ruler of you, clods
I am the cat god, bow before me.
All the egyptions and their sacred cat inscriptions
are true,
let this stick in your head like so much stiff glue.
I will rule city, no, country, no, more!
I will rule over a planet with felines galore!"
"How will you do that", one kitten said, with a ribbon on neck and a bow on her head.
The cat god replied,
"You've seen the humans travel though space! We'll go there too, and rule our own place!
They work the shuttles, so why can't we?
We are much smarter, much smarter you see!"
I've learned of the doors, the fridges the pots,
They work quite simply, all you lots.
A rocket of course, is far more complicated, but we can do it,"
The wonder cat stated.
"But those planets," said one, "which we can't survive. With no water, the coldness, why, how would we thrive?"
"We'll take what we want from this planet, you'll see!
There's a lot to be done with their technology. 
I'll be your leader, now here'd you first order.
Get all that we need from all round the border.
We need all the cats, the cats of the world. We need food, we need water, and everything else,
so everyone, go get what you can, use your mighty claws,
we'll prove there is less power in hands than in paws!
