<H1><center>Rescue Rangers Art</center></h1><p>
This is my 'Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers' Fan Art. I've just started drawing CDRR pics, so I'm not totally down with the feel of the characters yet ( whatever that means ).
This section is also very small, but it'll grow.<p>

<a href=gadget.jpg>gadget.jpg</a>A grayscale Gadget, looking angry, with a little "Gloom" cloud over her head. I had to draw in some computer-drawn hair over her eye so it'd look better. In ink and pencil.<br>
<a href=gadget2.jpg>gadget2.jpg</a>Gadget looking sad, and pointing out something. In pencil.<br>
<a href=gadget4.gif>gadget4.gif</a>My best Gadget pic so far, and one of my first. She's laying down, reading a book, badly shaded. Origionally in ink, edited to apperar to be computer-drawn.<p>
