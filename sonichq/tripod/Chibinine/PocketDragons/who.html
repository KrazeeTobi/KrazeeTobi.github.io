<H1><center>Who Are The Pocket Dragons?</center></h1><p>
The Pocket Dragons are very tiny dragons.. But not the kind with the sharp teeth and the fire breath and the red eyes, oh no- They're friendly, cute and have an uncontrollable love for cookies.
Read on about the many different Pocket Dragons.<br>
<b>Filbert</b><br>
Filbert is the only Pocket Dragon that doesn't have a kid's or baby's voice, so I think he's the oldest.
He acts like it too.. Well, sort of. He leads the others around, and is sort of bossy. Like the theme song says, he always thinks he's right. When introduced as Filbert, he adds nonchalantly, "The leader!"<br>
Filbert wears a red bandana with a big yellow star on it around his neck.<p>
<b>Specks</b><br>
Specks' main feature is his big glasses. He sounds older than the rest, but not as old as Filbert, and has a bit of a nasal voice. He's cunning, and likes to steer the Pocket Dragons from the right way, into a way that gets them into trouble.
He likes to play tricks on people, which leads him and the others into a big mess.<p>
<b>Scribbles</b><br>
Scribbles is my favorite Pocket Dragon. She's supposedly a genius, and makes lots of inventions. The only problem is that they never work! She keeps on trying though, and is pretty smart. She always carries a big pencil in a pink backpack-like thing with her all the time.<p>
<b>Cuddles</b><br>
Cuddles has a split personality. When he's awake, he's a sleepy, cowardly little dragon, but when he's asleep, he becomes the brave Sir Cuddles! As Sir Cuddles, he's sleep-playing, and mistakes ordinary objects for monsters and bad guys he must fight. This of course gets him into all sorts of trouble, and it's up to the other Pocket Dragons to wake him up.
When he's awake though, he's just the opposite! He's always got a pillow with him and is sleepy all the time. He'd rather take a nap than go on a big adventure. Cuddles is rathar chubby, and his stomach is purple as well as his ears.<p>
<b>ZoomZoom</b><br>
ZoomZoom's dream is to fly. He always wears pilot headgear, makes plane noises and actions, and jumps off high places trying to fly. His name comes from what you'll always hear him saying, "Zoom Zoom ZOOM!" He's pretty brave, but sometimes he doesn't look where he's going when he's playing airplane, which leads to.. you guessed it, trouble.
<p>
<b>Baby Pocket Dragon</b><br>
The baby Pocket Dragon has a name, but I don't know what it is. I'll find out, don't worry! I don't know much about her either, just that she seems smarter than the rest of the Pocket Dragons! I'll get some more info on her soon.<p>
