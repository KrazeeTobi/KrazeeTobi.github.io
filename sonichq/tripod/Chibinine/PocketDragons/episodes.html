<H1><center>Episodes</center></h1><p>
This section will list all the episodes of the Pocket Dragons TV show. This page is NOT finished.<br>
I still have yet to see all the episodes, let alone list them! If you want to see what I will do with this page, check out the Upcoming Stuff section, listed on the main page.<br>
A new episode every day, not on weekends or holidays. ( That's when I don't have a chance to see the show. ).<p>
<b>The Frog Prince</b>-Specks tries to become a magician to impress the Princess, and accidently turns her into a frog! To change her back, they must find something in the mountains. But the Princess Frog gets captures on the way!<p>
<b>Now You See Me, Now You Don't!</b>-Trying to do an invisibility spell, Scribbles gets an invisibility cloak from a con man. It doesn't work, but Scribbles doesn't know it, and the other Pocket Dragons don't intend to tell her that.<p>
