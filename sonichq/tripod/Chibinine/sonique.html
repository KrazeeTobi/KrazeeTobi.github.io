<p>
This is my Sonic the Hedgehog fanart. I'm starting out with all of my most recent art, since my drawings have improved.
You can still view the old art via the link at the bottom of the page.<br>

<a href=sally.jpg>sally.jpg</a>-Sally, in a grayscale. In pencil.<br>
<a href=amyrose.jpg>amyrose.jpg</a>-A pic of Amy Rose, saluting. I actually computer-colored this pic, which is a first. I originally painted it. In ink, and.. well, you know.<br>
<a href=bunant2.jpg>bunant2.jpg</a>-Heeheehee.. Bunnie and Antoine, kissing, in a more realistic form. Very sketchy. In pencil. <br>
<a href=bunnie2.jpg>bunnie2.jpg</a>-Bunnie and Antoine, again more realistic, in formal wear. Bunnie's de-rotboticized, BTW. I like how I did Bunnie, but I wish I'd done Antoine better. O whel. In pencil.<br>
<a href=hershey.jpg>hershey.jpg</a>-First it was gonna be a pic of Antoine. Then Tails. Finally, I settled on Hershey. Mouse drawn.<br>
<a href=sallycom.jpg>sallycom.jpg</a>-Sally,with a weird background. Mouse drawn. <br>
<a href=sonics.jpg>sonics.jpg</a>-A realistic Sonic, looking up. In pencil.<br>
<a href=tailsnamy.jpg>tailsnamy.jpg</a>-Tails and Amy Rose, the young'uns of the group. In ink and pencil crayon.<br>

<a href=/sonichq/tripod/Chibinine/bunnie.jpg>bunnie.jpg</a>-Bunnie Rabbot, in a basic standing pose. I sent this one as a sample pic to Artail Productions to apply for a fanart section.. Only time will tell.. In pencil.<br>
<a href=/sonichq/tripod/Chibinine/chibisal.jpg>chibisal.jpg</a>-Sally, kneeling. In ink.<br>
<a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://spacecat.virtualave.net/lonesome.jpg>lonesome.jpg</a>-Sally, looking sadly into the distance.<br>
<a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://spacecat.virtualave.net/salfigte.jpg>salfigte.jpg</a>-Sally, with her dukes up. She was origionally supposed to be nervous, but it scanned weird. In ink.<br>
<a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://spacecat.virtualave.net/sonic.jpg>sonic.jpg</a>-Sonic, just standing there, looking kind of worried. In ink and pencil crayon.<p>
