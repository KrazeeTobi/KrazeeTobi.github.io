Here are two pages from sonic the hedgehog #18, which featured for the first time, Julayla, Sally's mentor.
I apologize for these not being in color, and divided by each two panels, it's just that my scanner is too small, and I had to use an old photocopier to make copies of these pages to cut the panels up, and I don't want to cut up my issue of #18.
Enjoy this, just don't steal any of these scans. <p>
