<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Intro</div>

<div class=itemtext>Mega Man 2 introduced a lot of the conventions that would be used in most of the Mega Man series, like 8 robots, E-Tanks, a variety of utility items, and the robot teleporter room.  It also introducced some of the most famous Mega Man bosses and weapons, such as Metal Man/Metal Blade and Wood Man/Leaf Shield.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Story</div>

<div class=itemtext>MM2 probably has the simplest storyline of the entire series.  Dr. Wily has built 8 robots of his own to counter Mega Man, and has returned for revenge and another world takeover.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Unique Features</div>

<div class=itemtext>Most of the changes made in Mega Man 2 really became part of the series in general.  MM2 is realy, basically, the most basic example of a Mega Man game.  I can think of 2 differences, though.  Instead of Rush, Mega Man gets around on 3 lifts called "Items."  The most unique feature of MM2 is an adjustable difficulty setting.  In difficult mode, Mega Man's shots do only half as much damage, rounded up, against bosses as they do in normal mode, and a few enemies take more hits.  Difficult mode uses the same settings as the Japanese version of MM2.  The normal mode in the English version was added because Capcom thought the game would be too difficult for U.S. players.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Robots</div>

<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Vulnerability Loop</div>

<div class=itemtext>This is one of 4 original-series games that has a non-loop pattern.  The Crash Bomb is not the vulnerability of any particular boss, although it is quite powerful against several of them, and the Metal Blade is the vulnerability of Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Metal Man himself, who is also vulnerable to the Quick Boomerang.
<p>Metal -> Metal -> Flash -> Quick -> Metal -> Bubble -> Heat -> Wood -> Air -> Crash<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Damage Data</div>

<div class=itemtext><a href=mm2-data.html>Data For Mega Man & Robot Masters</a><br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Beginner's Level Orders</div>

<div class=itemtext>You'll need to fight 2 Robot Masters with the plasma cannon with this level order, but they're both fairly easy, and you'll get the Quick Boomerang and Item-2 faster.  The downside is that you won't have the Leaf Shield for the unlimited 1-up trick in Air Man's stage.
<p>Air -> Flash -> Quick -> Metal -> Bubble -> Heat -> Wood -> Crash
<p>This level order starts with Metal Man, and gives you the proper Master Weapon for all following bosses, while giving you the Air Shooter before entering the jumper-filled stages of Flash Man and Quick Man (see its weapon description for the reason).  However, you won't have Item-2 for Heat Man's stage.
<p>Metal -> Bubble -> Heat -> Wood -> Air -> Flash -> Quick -> Crash<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Advanced Level Order</div>

<div class=itemtext>If you're planning to use the plasma cannon against most or all of the bosses, this level order wil keep you equipped with the best weapons possible for each level.

<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Weapons</div>

<div class=itemtext>Metal Blade<br>
Usefulness: 10<br>
Energy Cost: 1/4<br>
The Metal Blade - one of the most popular weapons in MM history!  The Metal Blade actually has below average power, just a little bit better than MM's regular Plasma Shot, but everything else about it is great!  The Metal Blade is a wide shot, and it can be aimed in 8 directions, so you can easily make shots that would be impossible with almost any other weapon.  It is also one of the most energy-efficient MM weapons, surpassed in this category only by the Quick Boomerang (see below).  The Metal Blade is a true general-purpose weapon - many players use it almost as much as the Plasma Shot, if not more!<br>
Quick Boomerang<br>
Usefulness: 6<br>
Energy Cost: 1/8<br>
You read that right.  The Quick Boomerang requires 1/8 of 1 point of weapon energy.  This means that, with 28 points at the beginning of a level, you can fire off 224 Quick Boomerangs without a recharge.  This is by far the most energy-efficient weapon in MM history.  The Quick Boomerang is a rapid-fire boomerang, so you only need to hold down the fire button to keep a continuous stream of boomerangs firing.  However, against most enemies, it has only about as much power as a Plasma Shot and its range is small.  The Quick Boomerang is useful in many situations, since the rapid-fire feature is useful against both large enemies an swarms of small enemies.<br>
Leaf Shield<br>
Usefulness: 7<br>
Energy Cost: 3<br>
The Metal Blade - one of the most popular weapons in MM history!  The Metal Blade actually has below average power, just a little bit better than MM's regular Plasma Shot, but everything else about it is great!  The Metal Blade is a wide shot, and it can be aimed in 8 directions, so you can easily make shots that would be impossible with almost any other weapon.  It is also one of the most energy-efficient MM weapons, surpassed in this category only by the Quick Boomerang (see below).  The Metal Blade is a true general-purpose weapon - many players use it almost as much as the Plasma Shot, if not more!<br>
Air Shooter<br>
Usefulness: 6<br>
Energy Cost: 2<br>
This surprisingly powerful weapon can defeat some of the toughest enemies in the game in one shot!  The Air Shooter fires 3 tornados that fly upwards and forward at an angle.  2 or 3 tornados can beat Sniper Joe's jumping mech, and a single tornado will beat the fire makers in Quick Man's stage and the pesky flyboys (helicopter enemies)!<br>
Crash Bomb<br>
Usefulness: 7<br>
Energy Cost: 3<br>
The Metal Blade - one of the most popular weapons in MM history!  The Metal Blade actually has below average power, just a little bit better than MM's regular Plasma Shot, but everything else about it is great!  The Metal Blade is a wide shot, and it can be aimed in 8 directions, so you can easily make shots that would be impossible with almost any other weapon.  It is also one of the most energy-efficient MM weapons, surpassed in this category only by the Quick Boomerang (see below).  The Metal Blade is a true general-purpose weapon - many players use it almost as much as the Plasma Shot, if not more!<br>
Time Stopper<br>
Usefulness: 3<br>
Energy Cost: All<br>
The Time Stopper will freeze all the enemies on screen, and the effect will last as long as your weapon energy supplies it.  There is no way to pause in the middle of the freeze, so all the weapon energy will be used.  This also means that, unlike the Ice Slasher, the Time Stopper won't let you switch to another weapon, so you can only use it to get past enemies.  This weapon will come in handy if you're having troiuble getting past the lasers in Quick Man's stage.<br>
Atomic Fire<br>
Usefulness: 2<br>
Energy Cost: 1,3,10<br>
The predecessor of the Mega Buster, this weapon charges from a tiny shot, to a medium shot, to a huge shot!  The tiny shot is weak, the medium shot average, and the huge shot is one of the most powerful MM weapons of all!  However, the large shot takes up so much weapon energy that the Atomic Fire can really only be used effectively once in a while.  And since it can be used so rarely, you can't really keep it charged ahead of time like you can with the Mega Buster.<br>
Bubble Lead<br>
Usefulness: 1<br>
Energy Cost: 1/2<br>
The Bubble Lead fires a bubble that travels along the floor and has below average power.  It can come in handy against the springers that glide along the floors of some levels, but it's mostly useful against certain bosses.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Items</div>

<div class=itemtext>Item-1<br>
Energy Cost: 2<br>
Item-1 releases floating flatforms that continually rise, similar to MM4's Balloon item.  You can have 3 on screen at once.  Dr. Light invents it after you defeat Heat Man.  It's useful in Flash Man and Metal Man's stages.<br>
Item-2<br>
Energy Cost: Varies<br>
Item-2 is a jet board, similar to the Rush Jet.  Dr. Light invents it after you defeat Air Man.  The amount of energy used depends on how long it flies on screen.  This is a very important item in Heat Man's stage.<br>
Item-3<br>
Energy Cost: Varies<br>
Item-3 bounces forward until it reaches a wall, which it will climb when Mega Man jumps on it.  When he jumps off, it climbs downward.  Dr. Light invents it after you defeat Flash Man.  The amount of energy used depends on how long it climbs on screen.  This is a useful item in Quick Man's stage.<br>
E-Tank<br>
Mega Man 2 introduces the E-Tank.  Select it and Mega Man's energy will increase to the maximum 28 level, although weapon energy is unaffected.  You can store 4 at a time in MM2, and they aren't part of MM2's passwords.<br><br></div></font></td></tr></table>
