List Credit - M Sipher

Hey hey, I'm here to educate and help out the fans.
 
I will be posting the OFFICIAL names of the minor ememies and Wily- level bosses, separated by game. These names were taken from official Capcom books from Japan, and I've included the American names from the booklets as alternatives in parenthesis. (I don't include anything from Nintendo Power, though.)
 
I strongly encourage people to spread this list to their
MegaMan/RockMan fan friends. I'm all for spreading information... 
 
So far, I have all of the classic-series games up to "RockMan & Forte", and only the first X-series game (though that situation should be remdied soon). I don't know if I'm gonna bother with Legends, since the complete name list of enemies for that game can be found in the
official strategy guide...
 
Okay, to start, here's the cast of RockMan/MegaMan 1...
 
Oh, and by the way. All of Wily's vehicles are simply called "Wily Machine (insert game number)" unless otherwise noted...
