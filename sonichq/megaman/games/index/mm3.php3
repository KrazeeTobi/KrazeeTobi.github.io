<div class=itemtext>Mega Man 3 is considered by some to be the greatest Mega Man game of all.  It's definitely one if the longest, one of the most uniquely styled, and one of my favorites.  This is actually the game that introduced me to Mega Man.  I happened to go to my brother's friend's house when they were playing it, and I was instantly hooked by the music, the feel of the game, the challenging, themed bosses, and the fact that you were supposed to use a different weapon for each boss.  The cards with Dr. Light's original robt series in the epilogue ade me curious about the series as a whole, and I rented MM4 as soon as it came out so I could play an entire Mega Man game myself.  I became an instant MegaManiac.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Story</div>

<div class=itemtext>Dr. Wily has supposedly defected to Dr. Light's side again, and he is working with ight to build a humongous peace-keeping robot, Gamma.  However, in order to complete construction, they need 8 special metals from mining colonies on various moons of the solar system.  Mining robots on these colonies have suddenly started a rebellion.  Once Mega Man wins, however, instead of going to the Skull Castle, he fights Doc Robot, another weapon-copy specialist who is designed to fill in for other robots during repairs.  He copies the attacks of all 8 robot masters from MM2.  Then, MM confronts Break Man, who appears to be the ringleader.  SPOILER:  However, Break Man retreats, and Dr. Light informs you that Dr. Wily has just stolen Gamma.  Mega Man meets up once again with the Rock Monster and the cloning machine from MM1, and defeats Wily, who is piloting Gamma.  However, this time, the Skull Castle starts to cave in, covering both Mega Man and Wily.  Break Man appears, apparently to help him fight Mega Man, but instead he takes Mega Man back to Dr. Light's lab.  Dr. Light recognizes Blues' whistle, and the player is told that Break Man was actually Proto Man in a mask.  Why he worked with Wily, and then took Mega Man to Dr. Light's lab, is not explained.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Unique Features</div>

<div class=itemtext>Mega Man 3 is the first MM game to have truly SUPERB music.  It's really just as good musically as any other in the series.  The level graphics also seem to have a darker, but very attractive style.  It also has 19 levels, the most of any Mega Man game yet.  It should also be mentioned that the game introduced Rush.  It's also the first of numerous MM games in which Wily is not supposed to be the villain, at least as far as Mega Man knows.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Robots</div>

<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Vulnerability Loop</div>

<div class=itemtext>This is one of 4 original-series games that has a non-loop pattern.  It actually has 2 loops, one of 3 robots and one of 5.  Also, Magnet Man has 2 vulnerabilities.  It should also be mentioned that all of the MM3 Robo Masters are vulnerable to their own weapon.

<div class=itemtext>You'll need to fight just 2 Robot Masters with the plasma cannon with this level order.  Magnet Man is fairly easy, and has the best weapon in the game, and Snake Man's weapon is great in Top Man's stage.
<p>Magnet -> Hard -> Snake -> Top -> Spark -> Shadow -> Gemini -> Needle<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Advanced Level Order</div>

<div class=itemtext>If you're planning to use the plasma cannon against most or all of the bosses, this level order will keep you equipped with the best weapons possible for each level.

<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Weapons</div>

<div class=itemtext>Magnet Missile<br>
Usefulness: 7<br>
Energy Cost: 2<br>
This weapon fires forward and then moves straight up or down when it fins an enemy above or below.  The Magnet Missile is very useful against flying or hopping enemies, like the kero hoppers, parachutes, and dragonflies, especially when you have to navigate around pits and need to prevent enemies from interfering with your jumps.<br>
Search Snake<br>
Usefulness: 7<br>
Energy Cost: 1/2<br>
The Search Snake travels along the floor very quickly and climbs or runs down any walls it finds.  It's a great weapon in places with a "staircase" design, like Top Man stage (use it against the top dispensing robots and the cat mini-bosses) and Shadow Man's stage (use it on the walking suzies and the floating lights).<br>
Hard Knuckle<br>
Usefulness: 6<br>
Energy Cost: 2<br>
The Hard Knuckle lets Mega Man fire off a fist, ewhich will start out slow and pick up speed as it moves.  You can also guide the Hard Knuckle's path by presing up or down.  The Hard Knuckle is required to break certain barriers in Wily's Skull Castle.  It also comes in handy against Hammer Joes.<br>
Shadow Blade<br>
Usefulness: 6<br>
Energy Cost: 1/2<br>
The Shadow Blade is actually very similar to the Metal Blade, except that it has a short range, it returns like a boomerang, it's a little bit less powerful, and you can only fire one of them on screen at a time.  The Shadow Blade is useful for hitting enemies at an angle.<br>
Top Spin<br>
Usefulness: 4<br>
Energy Cost: Varies<br>
The Top Spin allows Mega Man to use contact with enemies to his advantage.  Just jump, and press the fire button, and MM will spin, damaging the enemies he spins into.  This is an extremley powerful attack, but it can be difficult to time your spins.  You'll often take damage yourself.  Many enemies are also immune to this attack, so you'll have to test to see which ones it actually works against, and that is obviously not easy.  The weapon energy used for the Top Spin depends on how long you hit the enemy and how much of Mega Man spins into it.  A spin move may take up very little energy or quite a bit.<br>
Gemini Laser<br>
Usefulness: 4<br>
Energy Cost: 2<br>
The Gemini Laser fires forward and bounces off walls diagonally.  It's fairly powerful in general and very useful against the powerful porcupines in Needle Man's stage and several other enemies.<br>
Needle Cannon<br>
Usefulness: 5<br>
Energy Cost: 1/4<br>
The Needle Cannon is similar to the MM2 Quick Boomerang, except that it fires straight forward instead of in a short but wide oval.  Like with the Quick Boomerang, you'll get rapid-fire by holding the fire button.  Useful for medium enemies and small, ambush-oriented enemies like the kero hopper.<br>
Spark Shock<br>
Usefulness: 0<br>
Energy Cost: 1<br>
The Spark Shock is similar to MM1's Ice Slasher in that it freezes an enemy.  However, unlike the Ice Slasher, it only works on certain enemies, and you can't switch to another weapon, so you basically just have to try to walk under or jump over them.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Items</div>

<div class=itemtext>Rush Coil<br>
Energy Cost: 3<br>
Rush will stand it front of Mega Man, and Mega Man can use him as a springboard.  You get the Rush Coil at the beginning of the game.<br>
Rush Jet<br>
Energy Cost: Varies<br>
The Rush Jet is actually slightly different in every MM game.  MM3's Rush Jet is the most powerful.  You can go up, down, left, right, or diagonally, although you should try to move in a straight line to fly quickly and reduce your energy use.  The Rush Jet can acttually be used as a more energy-efficient version of the Rush Coil, once you hav it.  You get the Rush Jet after, I think, Snake Man's stage.<br>
Rush Marine<br>
Energy Cost: Varies<br>
This is really a lot like an underwater version of the Rush Jet, although plasma shots are fired from Rush's mouth instead of Mega Man's arm cannon.  You get the Rush Marine after Shadow Man's stage, and it's most useful in Gemini Man's stage.<br>
E-Tank<br>
Select the E-Tank and Mega Man's energy will increase to the maximum 28 level, although weapon energy is unaffected.  You can store 9 at a time in MM3, and they are included in MM3's passwords.<br><br></div></font></td></tr></table>
