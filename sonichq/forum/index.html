This is a general discussion forum for a wide range of topics, not all of them necessarily having to do with Sonic.  This is a lot like a family or club where Sonic topics are used as a common ground.  Be sure to read the rules before you post.  The MF has ALWAYS had a personality all its own and to try and lay it out here wont do it justice. ^_^ Just go to the forum.<br><br>

One of the longest running Sonic general discussion forums on the net! ^_^ Pop in and say hi, Pretty much anything is on topic here.

<br><br>Subjects: Discussions, Polls, Science, Philosophy, Debates, Games, Cartoons, Anything!<br><br>
