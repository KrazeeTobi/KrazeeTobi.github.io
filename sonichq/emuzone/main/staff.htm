<b><font face=Arial color=ffffff>Our Goal And Cornerstone</b>
</td></table>

<img src="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/s&k.jpg" align=right>

<blockquote><br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Every page needs a goal. Basically - what we strive for and what we 
want to do. Sonic HQ for a long time has had the stigmata of being a big boisterous page with a lot of "staffers" when in 
reality - thats not at all who we are or the sight we want. Though previous people have stressed that the page was competetive, under Vector and myself's hand,
thats not really the way we want to be seen. True, the goal of some pages is to be competetive, but in all honesty we look at this as one 
of our personal webpages. This is a page we want to be able to put on a resume, a page where we can come in after school and tinker around with. A hub of sorts 
where we can be friendly, and others can be friendly to us. Rather than being seen as competetive, we want to be seen as friendly and creative. That is our goal.

<p>With a page like this, you have to strive for professionalism, but you also have to keep in mind this is also our personal webpage. We design it so everyone can look 
at it, but we also design it so that when we finish making those graphics, or meeting those new people in our forum, or finishing a new page - we can be proud of it. After all - 
isn't that the goal of any page? What good is doing something, if you're not happy with it or can't take delight in it? If you don't, it becomes a chore.

<p>People say quite often that the page isnt like how it was when Zifei (the previous webmaster who left to follow HIS 
creativity) had it or back when it was smaller. Yes, the bigger you get, the less personable a page can get. We hope to not lose this personability.
And no Zifei isn't on the page anymore. This is Vector and WB's baby now. And while we may not be everything Zifei was when 
he did the page, we are who we are. And this page - we hope - will be a reflection of that. So don't come in here 
expecting the past, expect the present. We're not Zifei, we're Vector and WB and thats all we want to be. Nothing more, and nothing less.

<img src="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/s&a.jpg" align=left>
<p>And to end off our "mission statement" as we coined it, when Sonic HQ first started, the staff was made up of only a few 
people. Now the staff count have risen to more than ten. Just because there are multiple people on the page, doesn't make it easier to maintain. It actually makes it harder since so many people want to do so 
many things. So we try to come together to discuss what we want so no one steps on each others toes. Its not as easy as it sounds, but we think we do a good job of it nonetheless. 
 The Sonic HQ staff is made of several parts, the html staff members, and the regular staff members and usual contributors. 
The html staff members do the actual update. What we look for is SERIOUS people who are creative and innovative, 
and willing to work in a group effort to do what we want to do - make the ultimate Sonic webpage. A true ultimate page is not just information and 
churning out news 24/7, but a true ultimate page does all that and provides a hub of creativity, ideas, responsibility, 
and most importantly - friendship. If you're interested in wanting to work on Sonic HQ for any reason, email us and tell us what you can do. 
Open positions are listed in the table to the right. The group is made up of a bunch of very compatible people and if you'd like to contact us, our emails are located below. 
There you will find our profiles, info about us, contacts and other stuffs...<br>

<p>Thanks for visiting, thanks for reading, and most of all thanks for asking. ^_^

otherwise she may throw pecans at us if we don't listen ^___^) Lien is really sweet though, and after her high school and

<a href="http://www.wheres.com/etc/sonic/">TSSZ</a>, he listens to the 1,000+ news themes he has, watch the news from 
different cities every chance he has, and tell the public that he is not insane because he's into TV News... Tristan also 
wants to anchor the local news from a top TV market, such as Philly, New York, or, his favorite for the obvious reasons, Los Angeles.  Maybe you'll see him someday on your local affiliate.  Who knows?<p>

<p>Gamisoy !!!!! Oh if only you people knew what that meant... ^_^

<p>Insane. Pure-D Insane. Thats the only way to describe this guy. Tether is cool as all heck, not to mention he's just....insane! My 
kind of guy. :) The newest member of the staff Tether here lives in the lovely idyllic confines of Greece - home of the Parthenon, ancient mythology, site for all those horribly bad 
Hercules take offs (cartoon included), and last but not least - Pitas! Say it with me - "Pitas". Doesn't it just roll off the tongue? 
As one of the new news editor out of 4 (Tristan, Rlan, and WB) MTB naturally bubbles over with enthusiam about his position - like a bomb filled with buzzing hyperactive bumblebees.
Rumor has it that MTB here has a certain infatuation with Troophead...who knew? ^_^

<p>Troophead - outspoken, bold, ready to pounce on any debateable topic like a sabre toothed tiger - and just as nice as she can be. This lady is the local literature buff
and you can tell by the way she used to keep the Fan-Fiction section in sway! Troophead is the queen of literature at HQ. Go on ask her any question! But dont get into a debate with her - you'll
never win. ^___^ Troophead took time off to do the moderating job, but she gladly chose Duo as her succesor to fanfic. And while we will miss her at least we have her there at the forum to knock some 
sense into those mad ravenous newbies! And whats this about MTB I hear? ^_^

When he gets out of Middleschool (and then Highschool) he'd like a career in animation....computer graphics/animation
He also likes to listen to/ read almost anything, and play videogames and the computer.

All you need give them is water and a Directory Page and you can be forever happy! Take Roger for instance - our local Fishboy - he's a really nice guy! He got us on various webrings, sorted our what was once our messed up Links Page, and is even making a 404 page for us.
All in all Fishboy is a great guy, and he'd make a nice entree at Captain D's too! ^_______^<p>
