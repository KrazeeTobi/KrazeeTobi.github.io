Sadly - this version of the "Sonic the Hedgehog" cartoon series was never completed...
"The Doomday Project", the final episode, left off with Robotnik supposedly dead, and his nephew Snively in charge. But more menacing were the mysterious glowing red eyes that accompanied Snively as the final ep faded to black...
It was canceled by Sega and DiC Productions after the 2nd season because of tough competition from the Power Rangers and ABC's stupid 2 seasons and you're out rule - the same rule that killed new eps of Reboot and other worthwhile Saturday moring cartoons. 
So what COULD have happened you ask? Keep reading...

And The Eyes Belonged To...</font></b>

<p>Some time ago - Ben Hurst, writer of MANY of the SatAM second season epidodes came to the Sonic Mailinglist. 
One of the first questions he was asked? Who did the eyes belong, and what would the developments of the 
third season been. Here is part of what Ben had to say...</p>

<p>Well, first of all, the red eyes in the tunnel belonged to...IXIS NAUGUS! 
The same wizard that first appeared in "The Void"! Yes, not Knuckles or Metal Sonic, but Naugus. 
Anyway, Snively tries to retake control of Robotropolis, but ultimately fails. 
On the verge of losing it all to the Freedom Fighters, he turns to "The Void", where Naugus is busy torturing Robotnik (and having fun with it) ^__^. 
Snively frees Naugus, and in the process also frees Robotnik & King Acorn! Now, Naugus assumes control, and starts his new command by trying to lure 
Sally into capture with the King as bait. Robotnik becomes Naugus' lackey. And Snively, now reduced to a simpering nobody, defects to the Freedom Fighters. 

<p>Ben went on later to say that more developments would have come along between the relationship of Sonic and Tails, coming a little closer to the game relationship it strayed so far away from. Sooner on down the line in possible future episodes
 we would have learned of the origins of Robotnik and Snively, and also come to see a whole new ballgame for the FF's...

<p>And THAT is what WOULD HAVE HAPPENED in the third season of the Sonic cartoon...
