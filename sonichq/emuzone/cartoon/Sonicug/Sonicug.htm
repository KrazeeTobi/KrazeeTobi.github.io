</center>"DiC has recently been working on a new Sonic series for the upcoming Spring." That's what we were told at the beginning of last Fall's season...reason to rejoice? Not quite...after <i>Adventures of Sonic the Hedgheog</i>, all we had left were reruns of the <i>Saturday Morning Sonic</i>, by far the best for the three and the basis of the comic. But fans were mortified to learn that this new series will be of a totally different spin from what the previous series were...<center>

Special thanks to <font color="orange">Alessandro Sanasi</font> for providing Sonic fans with this new information!
<p>Currently in the makings, the first season will have 40 episodes with animation done by either DiC France or DiC China. The show is supposed to be a mix between the syndicated and the SatAM cartoon (oh my.....). But it will be a completely new setup, with NO references to the original SatAM cartoon. This means no Sally, no Bunnie, no Rotor, no Antoine, no Dulcy, no Scratch, no Grounder, and most mortifyingly - SUPPOSEDLY not even Tails! Apart from Sonic and Robotnik, no other of the established SEGA characters seem to be in. It will most likely be shown on UPN or FOX. In the new episodes, Sonic will have a brother named Manic and a sister named Sonia, and together they form a music band they call "Sonic Underground". And while they travel from town to town in disguise, give concerts to raise the spirits of the oppressed Mobians and help people in need. They are also searching for their mother, Queen Aleena Hedgehog, who is the rightful ruler of Mobius. But Aleena is constantly pursued by SWATbots, because Sheriff Robotnik wants to force her to marry him so he will become Rightful King - BUT....It seems things aren't quite as good as things the show will be premiering later than expected...
<p>Alas, SEGA still keeps most of it under wraps, but I'll give you an overview of the info that has already leaked out...and more. Since everything is still unofficial, of course the final version may differ from what we tell you here.

<font color="orange">Sonic Underground In A Nutshell</font>
<p><b>The Great Legend</b> 
<p>"One future day, the planet Mobius will be ruled in peace by the Council of Four - Queen Aleena and her three children. Sheriff Robotnik will be defeated, and freedom will be won for all citizens."
<p>When Robotnik learned that the Queen had given birth to triplets, he ordered his SWATbots to capture them, so the prophecy could never be fulfilled. But the Queen sent her children into hiding in different parts of the planet, while she herself left her home and from then on wandered around Mobius. 
<p>Years later, when Sonic had already become a Freedom Fighter, he learned about his siblings, and from then on didn't rest until he had found them.
<p><b>The Band</b>
<p>The band "Sonic Underground" is formed by three members. Sonic, who plays a guitar, his brother Manic, who plays the drums, and their sister Sonia, who plays the keyboard. 
<p>Together they travel around Mobius, always in hope to one day find their mother, while constantly pursued by Robotnik's forces. Whereever they go, they try to help the troubled citizens they meet on their quest, and with their music they spread the spirit of freedom in the minds of the oppressed Mobians. 
<p><b>The Characters</b> 
<p><i>Sonic</i><br> 
Sonic is the usual high-speed hero with fast moves and cool talking. He only fears water, since he can't swim. His instrument is the guitar. 
<p><i>Sonia</i><br> 
Used to take care of herself before she joined the band, Sonia is quite an independent character, and almost as eager to join any action that comes her way as Sonic is. Her instrument is a portable keyboard synthesizer. 
<p><i>Manic</i><br> 
Manic looks a lot like a buzzcut blond-wigged version of Sonic, wearing black shades. Manic often has his head in the clouds and is sometimes so caught by his own beat that he forgets what happens around him, which can bring him into dangerous situations from which Sonic and Sonia then have to rescue him. His instrument are a set of drums. 
<p><i>Robotnik</i><br> 
As always, Robotnik is the ultimate villain of the series, this time with the difference that he has given himself the title "Sheriff". To finally become Rightful Ruler of Mobius, he is obsessed by the idea to find Queen Aleena and marry her. 
<p><i>Sleet and Dingo</i><br> 
Sleet and Dingo are two Bounty Hunters working for Robotnik (a wolf and a jackal). Both are experts in camouflage, and have the ability to morph into any object they want, although there will still be some characteristic of their usual appearence (think "Little Wizards", if anyone remembers that cartoon).
