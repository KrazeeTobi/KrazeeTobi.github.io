<b>Trouble in Sonic 3's Carnival Night Zone, Act 2</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
I can't get past one point in Sonic 3.  It's in the Carnival Night Zone, where you enter a room with a barrel-like object that goes up and down when you jump on it.  This is very frustrating!
</font>
<p>
This is definitely the #1 trouble spot in any Sonic game.  Jump on the barrel and hold down on the D-pad after you land.  The barrel will go down a bit, and will then stop and go back up.  When the barrel begins to move back up, hold up.  When the barrel slows and begins to go down, hold down again.  Whenever the barrel shifts momentum, hold the direction that it's about to move in.  Eventually, it will go further up and down each time.  The level continues at the bottom of the shaft that the barrel is in.  When you get the barrel low enough, you will be able to jump off and continue through the level.

<b>Mysterious Sonic 2 Zones and the Elusive Sonic Arcade</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
How can I get to the Hidden Palace Zone in Sonic 2?  Or the Wood Zone, or the Neo Green Hill Zone, or the Dust Hill Zone?<p>Do you have any Sonic Arcade Info?
</font>
<p>
The Hidden Palace Zone is the most famous of several zones that were removed from Sonic 2.  It was apparently removed late in Sonic 2's development, because it appeared often in gaming magazines and promotions before the game was released.  We don't really know why the zones were taken out, but it probably had to do with keeping the game on schedule or saving cartridge space.<p>
There should soon be info about them on the Gaming Info page (might even be there as you're reading this).  Another source is <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.emulationzone.org/sections/sonic/secret/" target="whole">Secrets of Sonic the Hedgehog.</a>  Pro Action Replay stuff and other hacks for playing Hidden Palace can be found at <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.angelfire.com/sc/SonicTheHedge/ target=whole>Tom's Sonic and NiGHTS Page.</a><p>

<b>Searching for Sonic Cartoons</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Where can see the Sonic cartoons or get videos of them?
</font>
<p>Sonic Underground is already being shown in Europe.  It's not on the air in the US because the cartoon has been bought by Bohbot Kids Network.  BKN is selling 2 syndicated "all-or-nothing" blocks of programming in August/September, and SU is part of one of these blocks.

<p>Toon Disney and some independent local channels show AoStH.  As far as we know, SatAM is not being broadcast anywhere at this time.

<p>It's very difficult to find SatAM on tape, but AoStH is easier to get.  Both can sometimes be found at Wal-Mart or Blockbuster.

<p>An English-translated Sonic Anime is supposed to come out in September.  We do have reports of one person buying it in Michigan, but the company that is making the video says September.

<p>You can get RealVideo versions of SatAM at <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.sirnex.com target=whole>Sir NEXCOM</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://starhedgehog.simplenet.com" target="whole">Star Hedgehog's Page</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://members.spree.com/SIP/soneec/" target="whole">Sonic Pandemonium</a>.  Star Hedgehog also has the Sonic Anime. <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://segasonic.simplenet.com>SegaSonic.Net</a> has the AoStH videos.

<p><a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://members.xoom.com/SonicTheHedg/>Tom's Sonic and NiGHTS Page</a> has a ton of Sonic Underground pics, sounds, and episode summaries.

<p>Please be aware that we don't run these sites and that the videos may occasionally become temporarily unavailable.  If you have a problem, try again later.

<font color=ff8000>Tails</font> and <font color=ff6090>Amy</font> - 8<p>
As far as I know, all other characters' ages are unknown.<p>

Issues:<p>
Knuckles will soon turn 16 in the comics.<br>
Sally is 16 in the SatAM cartoon, but 15 in the comics.  Elias' age is unknown, but he's definitely older than Sally.<br>
Julie-Su's age of 15 is unconfirmed right now.<br>
Amy is 10 in the comics, and seems to be in her early teens according to SoA.  It's rumored that she'll also be a teenager in Sonic Adventure.  However, 8 is still the age given by SoJ.<p>

Tails was first revealed to the public as 4 and a half, and that was the age used in gaming magazines, in AoStH, and on the plush toy's box.  However, the SatAM cartoon depicted him as a 10-year-old, and the Fleetway version of Tails is a teenager.  Somewhere along the line, SEGA changed their minds about his age too.  He's listed as 8 in Sonic Jam, and that seems to be the current age given by SoJ.

<b>Sega's Restrictions</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Why wasn't Sega as strict with SatAM as they are with Archie Comics?
</font>
<p>Sega is different today.  Back then they thought they could do no wrong. Today's Sega takes everything more seriously, especially their mascot. Another reason is that DiC is much larger than Archie, so they had more power to force Sega to listen to them.

<b>SatAM Cancellation</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Why was Sonic's ABC Saturday morning cartoon cancelled?
</font>
<p>
The most popular theory is that the Power Rangers drove Sonic's ratings down.  ABC moved the show's timeslot several times to avoid competition from Power Rangers, but rarely advertised the change, and that made it hard to keep track of the time when the show came on.  Fox kept following them by moving Power Rangers to whatever timeslot Sonic was put in.  The combination of confusing time slot changes and competition from the Power Rangers is supposedly what drove SatAM out.

<b>SatAM 3rd Season</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
I read something about a 3rd season for SatAM.  Can you give me information about it?
</font>
<p>
You can find out more info on the cancelled 3rd season on the <a href="/sonichq/emuzone/cartoon/cartoon.htm" target="whole">Cartoon Info Page</a>.  In short, the red eyes seen in the 2nd season finale belonged to Naugus, who would soon take over Robotropolis and make Robotnik his Snively-like assistant.  Snively would be kicked out and join the Freedom Fighters.  I think that Snively becoming a Freedom Fighter would have led to some very interesting situations and plenty of chances for character development.

<b>Sonic Adventure and Dreamcast Release</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Will DC be released in May?  Will SA be a pack-in?
</font>
<p>DC will most likely not come out in May. Sega isn't stupid enough to repeat a Saturn.  Besides, if it was coming in May, we probably would have seen a lot more hype by now.  The DC is still officially scheduled for September 9th.
<p>SA will probably not be a pack-in, because selling the system alone allows Sega to advertise a lower price.  Yes, it would probably be cheaper for the consumer and possibly Sega too, but having a lower price associated with your system is important.  The same thing happened with Mario 64, even though Nintendo actually sold just as many copies of Mario 64 as they did N64 systems.  This is one of the many illogical things about marketing :).
