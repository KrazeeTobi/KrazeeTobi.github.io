This interview is done by WB, the forgotten one...:-) Seriously, WB will be doing a few interviews now to help out with tough college schedule faced by both him and Vector. Anyway, this interview is with <a href="mailto:Kedzie-K@email.msn.com">Kedzie K.</a>, the webmaster of the super-popular Sonic fan site: <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://kedziek.simplenet.com/">The Sonic Foundation</a>! Not only is it a great site to visit, it also has a news page simular to ours. And if you visit our links page, you'll see that this is the only page that received a perfect score of 20/20 from one of our reviewers. Now go on and read the interview.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: ERP ! OK - How did you become a Sonic fan? 

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: From playing Sonic 1 on my Genesis. I was a huge Mario nut 
back then and Sonic came along and I became an instant fan.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: Cool. So after playing all of that Mario then and more of 
Sonic now? Who do you like more? :)

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I'll have to say Sonic, most definitely.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Mario was good for its time, but Sonic has that huge 
likability about him you just can't ignore.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I'm still a Mario fan, but I'm a much bigger Sonic fan.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: Now as for TSF - Many people call your site one of the top 
Sonic sites around on the net. And with 50,000 + hits that's an awesome 
accomplishment to back up that statement.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: So here's the question - how did you come to start it? And 
why?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Well, about 3 years ago, one of my friends showed me
rat.org, the old Sonic info page...

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: And that's when I realized that Sonic had a huge following
on the Internet. I really didn't decided to start with tSf until 
last year.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Simply because I kinda procrastinated a bit and was trying
to find the time.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: So it was basically a part of following the huge trend of 
people that followed Sonic?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: You could say that. I think of tSf as my personal 
contribution to Sonic fandom on the Internet, much like every other 
person who owns a Sonic site also.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: Coolness. What do you think makes your site so popular?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Honestly, I never really thought why my site is so over with 
the fans. Offhand, I would say I try to make my site as unique as I can.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I'm not saying my site is the best one around. I try to give 
the Sonic fans what they would like in any site.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: Cool - But there has been something that has been on our 
minds for the longest time: How do you find the time to run your site
by yourself? I mean - You're GOOD at doing it alone and sometimes even 
WE at HQ have problems as a group! :)

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Well, I think of my site as "volunteer work". I put out a 
couple of hours a day to work on it, update it, get news and whatever.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Running the site is like my job.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: What do you think of the Sonic comics as of late? Where 
would you like to see them go and how do you see them now?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: The Sonic comics are doing very well, in my opnion.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Knuckles being better than Sonic. As far as Knuckles, I say 
"more power to Ken Penders" for making a spinoff comic so successful.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: And Sonic?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: For Sonic, it could be better. Sometimes they're cool and 
other times they're just "eh.."

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I don't mean to make excuses for Karl Bollers, but I think 
he's still adjusting to writing "Sonic".

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: All right - 2 more questions: Sonic Adventure - What do
you think?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Sonic Adventure has to be the most-packed video game I have 
ever layed my eyes on...

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I mean, the replay value of this game seems to go through
the roof. My only beef with the game is that it reminds me too much of
Super Mario 64.

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I just can't wait till this September.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: Mario 64? How?

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Well, Sonic Adventure and Super Mario 64 are the same genre 
(Action/Adventure with a little RPG mixed in)...

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: They also have the same transition between action and 
adventure stages...

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Also, the zones/courses (from what I've seen) are similar in 
size. SA's zones may be bigger but it's in a way similar anyway.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: OK - Last question: What do you think about Sonic HQ? We 
had to ask! :) 

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: I have to say that you guys are the best Sonic news site 
around. Without question. ;)

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: The rest of your site is pretty well put together as well. 
I'm impressed.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: Why thank you for saying so! Hopefully we'll be more 
organized by the end of the year with the move. And thanks for giving
us your time with this interview ! You will probably be our first new 
interview of the new year!

<p><font color="red">Kedzie-K</font>: Thanks a lot.

<p><font color="orange">Sonic HQ</font>: End of interview. Chicken and burritos will be served in 
the Green Room.
