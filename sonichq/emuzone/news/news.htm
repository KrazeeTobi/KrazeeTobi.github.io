<b><font face="arial">Breaking News - Fleetway Sonic Adventure Adaption! Nigel Kitching Is Officially Back! Fleetway Comics Gets A New Editor!</font></b> - WB 12:30 am CST, 11-2-99</font></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Once upon a time, the Fleetway comics were the best thing on the market the UK had Sonic wise as far as comics go. But with certain mismanagement it slowly became more and more depressing, sinking into an endless rut of reprints, one new story
per issue, and sinking into a directional rut. Then came the corker as Nigel Kitching, one of the best writers for STC was fired for no reason in the middle of a major storyline "due to cutbacks". 

<p>Well now it can finally be told as Mr. Kitching made the announcement yesterday that he is OFFICIALLY back as writer on Fleetway's <b>Sonic The Comic!</b>
This is from what was stated:

<p><i>I have a little news for you. I'm back on Sonic The Comic. I start with issue 175 and have had a synopsis
for a ten issue run approved by the new editor Andy Diggle. My ten issue run will incorporated characters and ideas from the new game.</i>

<p><b>Excerpt From His Story Proposal:</b> <i>..."But now the whole Sonic world seems to have become repetitive and stale and
I think it's time to start again. Try to forget that these characters have
been around for all these years, to stand back and take a fresh look at
them. We're starting to get stories that explain continuity issues, and this kind
of plot, by its very nature, looks backward. It's time to draw a line under
what has gone before and start again. I want to produce stories that look
forward, that give the reader the feeling that something exciting is just
around the corner."</i>

<p>First of all its great to see Mr. Kitching back - especially returning at the crux of the 175th issue of the comic (quite a feat) and focusing on new stories with a fresh perspective! He made a LOT of STC what it is as far as plot, storylines, and characters go.
Nigel Kitching also disclosed a few other things - most notably: 
Andy Diggle, assistant editor of 2000AD and editor of The Judge Dredd Megazine in the UK (two more mature comics) is new editor to replace Deborah Tate. 
Knuckles will play a prominent role in the SA Adaption, he doesn't know yet if it will happen, but he wants long time artist Richard Elson to draw the story.
How Super Sonic and Chaos will fit in (because of the current situation Super Sonic was left in during the role of the book) is unknown.

<p>To find out more on Nigel Kitching, check out our latest interview with him <a href=/sonichq/emuzone/news/archive/Interviews/nkitching_interview.htm>here.</a> Congratulations Mr. Kitching and congratulations Sonic Fleetway fans! You finally got your wish. ^_^

<b><font face="arial">Upcoming Sonic Adventure Online Contests From Sega!</font></b> - WB 12:30 am CST, 11-2-99</font></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>The Dreamcast has brought a lot of new experiences to the console community, one of those being a stable gaming network. Saturn and even Genesis attempted to link gamers on the internet, but our beloved 128-bit box has been the most successful incarnation yet. Some of the new additions to the on-line family from Sega happens to be the "Sonic World Rankings" contest, the Sonic 2K competition, and special downloadable add-ons for special occasions like the Halloween "Tremble Park" from a few days ago. 

<p>Charles Bellfield, director of marketing communications at SOA has this to say about our hedgehogs foray into the Net, "Sega's plan is to continue to phase in online gameplay elements, giving consumers new experiences never seen before on a console. Sonic Adventure' is the first of many games that will be given additional `arms and legs' through the Internet." 

<p>Want to know more about these competitions? The Sonic World Rankings is a forum for gamers to compare their best times and scores for Sonic Adventure against other top speeders from around the world. Each will be broken down by section and particular character with gamers tasked to head out, play, and procure the best possible package of points. All the details can be found at the Sonic homepage, but if you haven't already gotten on board with the competition, you better hurry considering that it opened last month, October 15th. 

<p>The next competition, co-sponsored by AT&T is the Sonic 2K contest. Collaborating with Sega's official Dreamcast Magazine, gamers will download special levels of the game and compete against others for prizes. Most of these courses are visually revamped levels, usually containing a few more cosmetic upgrades to keep the competitions fresh. Prizes vary, but include a free year of internet access through AT&T WorldNet as well as Dreamcast merchandise including game copies. Like the Sonic World Rankings, the Sonic 2K competition started October 15th, but will only run till January 14, 2000 as a series of three, three week contests. 

<p>For now, crank up the on-line options of your Dreamcast and check out all the information regarding these two contests. We'll let you know of any announcements that pour out of Sega regarding their plans to put our happy hedgehog and beloved box to good use on the World Wide Web...

<p>From the "completely out of left field department":

<p>Now available in stores is the DreamStation, a cool little Playstation -> Dreamcast joystick adaptor which enables you to use your Playstation Dual Shock controllers on the Dreamcast, all the Dreamcast force feedback vibration functions are supported. Almost too cool considering that from what I've heard - 
theres a lot of supposed force feedback on Sonic Adventure. ^_^

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Well its time for our latest poll reviews! First of all let me take the time to thank everyone that responded to our email survey asking what the wanted to see in Sonic HQ.
The number one response - LOADING TIMES. Its a hassle, an annoyance, and overall its not very nice. ^_^ Vector and I had a talk about things and over the next two months we'll be going 
page by page correcting erros, fixing links, and working on lagging load times to make HQ more effecient for you - the viewer. Also duly noted - updates are now most definetly every weekend (as you've been seeing by my front page input) and 
I'll be working more at having more of my notes on the front page during the week to keep the message from getting stale. :) Thanks for your input - and now down to the polling:

<p><b>So - do you think Sonic Underground sucks as much as I do?</b>

<p><i><font color=cyan>
25 Votes (14%): Sucks??? You must be out your pea-picking mind! It's great stuff!</font>
<br><font color=yellow>73 Votes (39%): Brother - this cartoon is the pits and everything more. 
And those songs! YICK!</font>
<br><font color=red>43 Votes (23%): (The boring answer) Its OK. Not good not bad...just OK</font>
<br><font color=white>44 Votes (24%): I like cheese weiner doodles! </i></font>
<br>Total Votes - 185 Votes</i>

<p>Cheese weiner doodles? You guys are crazy. ^_^

<p>This was totally expected. And yes - I STILL think Sonic Underground sucks. Why Sega Of America chooses to farm thier 
mascot out to the guys that created the first two is beyond me. Don't get me wrong - SatAM was OK minus noticeable flaws, but they should have known better the minute they saw AoSTH.
Even ABC rejected THAT. And why DiC Animation chose something totally new over what Sonic fans were already familiar with (The SatAM continuity) is beyond me. 
Perhaps in the future, if there is ever to be another Sonic cartoon - lets hope an animation company with direction common sense gets the liscense. Better yet - I'd rather see a new anime series.

<p><b>With over half a year on thier slate to do it, do you think Archie can pull off a good Sonic Adventure adaption without screwing it up?</b>

<p><i><font color=cyan>
62 Votes (53%): Optimist Answer - I have good faith that they could actually pull it off this time...</font>
<br><font color=yellow>20 Votes (17%): Pessimist Answer - C'mon...This is Archie! You know - The Endgame People!</font>
<br><font color=red>36 Votes (31%): Realist Answer - NO ONE can do a sonic Team game justice! NO ONE! (36)</font>
<br>Total Votes - 118 Votes</i>

<p>Perhaps the phrase "realist answer" should have been replaced with "purists answer" but at the same time I was surprised to see so much faith put in Archie on the adaption.
Perhaps this shows that they really are getting better in thier storytelling, now that Robotnik is back in continuity and Sonci is back among the Freedom Fighters.
Of course, no one can expect a PERFECT adaption, but its good to know that Archie is trying and willing to put in the effort for us Sonic fans.

<P>Today we have 3 polls for you: focusing on none other than SegaSonic, Archie Sonic, and the Cartoon Sonic: The two part question "What Sonic continuity would you most like to see in a cartoon?" with its follow up on the next poll update, 
then we have "Will you be buying a Neo Geo Pocket Color for the release of Sonic Pocket Adventure?", and lastly "Excluding Doctor Robotnik (obvious choice) - Who is the absolute best villian in Sonic comic continuity?"
Let's get to voting! ^_^
