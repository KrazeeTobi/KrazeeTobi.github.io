A pretty good story except that the fight scene seems more like one of those choreographed movie fights than a real one, partially due to the fact that the Freedom Fighters kept making witty snide comments after every blow without tiring or losing breath.

However, it's not just an ordinary comet... Chapters One and Two of "Close Encounters of the Sonic Kind." Pretty good, but not excellent. Reminds me of Wells' "War of the Worlds" and Bradbury's "Martian Chronicles," though the author claims influence from "Sphere." Well, it's the same genre. You decide. Rated G.

<br>A mult-part story about a purple cat named Savannah, known as Slash because of a tendency to shred things up when she is nervous. When Knuckles finds her unconscious on the Floating Island, he and the Knothole Freedom Fighters are dragged into the affairs of another reality. It's very well written, though it focuses more on Slash and her home planet than the Sonic universe. Rated PG for ONE cuss word in part 2. Geez....

Two days after he sets out to find the plans and crystal and has not reported back to Knothole, the F.F.s start worrying. They are too late to stop Lt. Grayson from being roboticized, but before he is, he leaves the Freedom Fighters with one last cryptic message that begins the mystery of the Star of Rhodesia and the search for a Colonel Moran. This is what we rarely see; a Sonic mystery! Very suspenseful; right when you think you've guessed who it is, the story takes another turn. Except for one case of stupidity on "Colonel Moron"'s part and one continuity error (Mobians don't use bullet weapons), this story is a must read! Rated PG for implied sex.

Meanwhile, Robotnik is continuing his sweep of the Great Forest for the same village. A very good story, but the "lusty Overlanders" thing failed miserably. There are better ways of writing an effective villian than making him a pervert. On another note, this is Ali's first fanfic, and she has improved a lot since. If you enjoyed this, I'd recommend her other fics; "The New Season" and "For Whom the Gavel Pounds" in the After Robotnik Section, and "Playing Dead" in this section. The sequel to this is "After Death", which can be found aboce. Rated PG-13 for adult language and sexual innuendo.

The plot seems okay, but Dawn has some trouble portraying characters correctly. Dawn isn't very familiar with Sonic because he doesn't get the comics where he lives.  Dawn portrays the FFs as a military group like the Rebel Alliance, when actually, all they are is a family that has to fight for what it believes in, which is why this story, like his other ones, turned out pretty screwed up. And having Dawn always saying, "Force speed!" and "Force jump!" gets really annoying. But the Eggman insults near the end were pretty funny; if you decide to read this, just scroll down to that part and laugh your head off.
