<b><p>When I originally made this page out, I had NO IDEA Sonic's arsenal was this huge - but believe it or not, it is! Split into five sections for - Ring Related Items, Chaos Emeralds, 
Miscellaneous Items and Objects (Star Posts, Bumper Blocks, etc), and Items attainable only by Monitor Boxes. Also located here are the complete list of items and weapons for two games with the LARGEST arsenal of all - Tails Adventure and Sonic Adventure - both of which have small RPG elements! Basically EVERY item can be used unless duly noted. Click on one of the anchor links below, to take you to whichever section of the page you would like to view first:

<DD><FONT COLOR="#55FFFF"><b>Power Rings</b></FONT>
<DD><blockquote>There are 5 natural elements on Mobius - Earth, Water, Wind, Fire - and the Power Ring! Sonic doesn't have an energy meter, and since Power Rings are found in many places on Planet Mobius, its these rings that Sonic catches to keep himself full of energy. Hit a monitor box with a ring in it and you are rewarded with 10 rings! Collecting 100 rings rewards Sonic with an extra life, and 50 rings plus 7 Chaos Emeralds will get Sonic access to his "Super" form. HOWEVER there is one catch - Whenever Sonic gets hit by a badnik or lands on spikes he loses his rings, and if you are hit with no rings in your possesion then you lose 1 life...

<DD><FONT COLOR="#55FFFF"><b>Dimensional Rings</b></FONT>
<DD><blockquote>First introduced in <i>Sonic 1</i>, Dimensional Rings are used as an alternate means of transportation to the Special Zone or other strange places!<p>  Dimensional Rings are MUCH LARGER than regular Power Rings.<p>
The Dimension Rings were first introduced in <i>Sonic 1</i>.  In this game, they were always found at the end of an act, and only appeared when you had finished the act with at least 50 rings.  This type of Dimensional Ring was also used to access the special stages in <i>Sonic CD</i> and <i>Knuckles' Chaotix</i>.<p>
In <i>Sonic 3 & Knuckles</i>, another type of Dimensional Ring was introduced.  Every act up to the Hidden Palace Zone had at least 2 Dimensional Rings hidden within.  In <i>Knuckles' Chaotix</i>, hidden Dimensional Rings, which only appearred if you had at least 20 rings, took you to the Bonus Zone instead of the Special Zone.<p>
A third type of dimension ring appeared in Sonic 3D Blast - these Dimensional Rings can be used to safely transport Flicky birds to their home dimension.

<DD><FONT COLOR="#55FFFF"><b>Blue Rings (Knuckles Chaotix Only)</b></FONT>
<DD><blockquote>Don't you just HATE IT when you lose all of your rings after getting hit by a badnik? First introduced in <i>Knuckles Chaotix</i>, the Blue Rings can automatically solve that problem.  The Blue Rings bond all of your regular rings into a single large ring.  These work like "backup shields," so it's best to try to have both a shield and a blue ring whenever possible.<p>
With the Blue Power Ring, antime you get hit by a badnik and don't have a shield, you lose your blue ring and the bonding goes in to effect.  Instead of losing ALL YOUR RINGS, you only lose 1 Large Ring - thus making it easier to collect!  The large ring bounces slowly for about 5 seconds before splitting apart into many rings that bounce away as they usually do.  Collect the large ring in time and you will have the complete total of rings, just like you did before!

<DD><blockquote>First introduced in <i>Knuckles Chaotix</i>, Chaos Rings are part of what fuels The Carnival Island and can be collected in the 3D Special Stages of the game!<p>
The Chaos Rings, in sequence, are gold, light blue, green, magenta, purple, and dark blue.  Robotnik already has the huge "Master Ring" in his possession.  At the end of the game, he uses its energy to turn Metal Sonic into Hyper Metal Sonic - a giant red version that is so large that its head barely fits on the screen!

<DD><FONT COLOR="#55FFFF"><b>Ring Tether (Knuckles Chaotix Only)</b></FONT>
<DD><blockquote>First introduced in <i>Knuckles Chaotix</i>, Ring Tethers allow 2 characters to become connected kind of like a rubber band that snaps together! This allows them to perform special moves and even throw another character at a badnik to destroy them!<p>

There are 5 common moves that you can do with the Tether Rings:
<p align=left>
1.  The basic use of the Ring Tether is to have one character run in a direction while the other digs in with his shoes and stays in one place (a "hold").  Eventually, the energy between the rings will glow red and the 2 characters will be unable to move further apart.  At this point, the holding character can stop holding, and both will run forward at great speed.<br>
2.  Alternatively, the running character can snap back towards the holding one, retaining all of his speed but moving in the opposite direction.  You can release the hold button and both characters will run in the direction that the running character is moving in.<br>
3. Toss your partner onto a high ledge or upper floor of the level.  When he lands, have him hold there, and he'll pull you up if you stretch the rings apart and release.<br>
4. Pick up your partner and you will be able to run without the bungee effect, sometimes making control a little easier.  Your partner will spin, so most badniks will be destroyed if you run into them.  The disadvantage is that you can't use your special moves while carrying your partner.<br>
5. The most difficult move is "flying."  Toss the second character into the air, and have him hold as he reaches the peak of his flight.  You'll start to snap up, and you should press up while this happens.  Your partner will snap up above you.  Press hold again.  Keep repeating this and you can theoretically fly as high as you want, but it's difficult to maintain.  Practice this move in the Isolated Island Zone.  It's not necessary for completing the game, but it will help you to find some hidden areas.</p>

<DD><FONT COLOR="#55FFFF"><b>The Chaos Emeralds</b></FONT>
<DD><blockquote>Chaos Emeralds are possibly the most POWERFUL source of raw abundant energy on the planet - and unfortunately Doctor Robotnik is ALWAYS after them. Chaos Emeralds MORE THEN LIKELY are found in the Special Zone, but rarer ones have been known to exist on the surface of Mobius. 7 Chaos Emeralds plus 50 power rings will grant thier owners access to the "Super Mode". These baubles of infinite energies possess mysterious powers and its with these that Robotnik wishes to power his most vicious creations! Chaos Emeralds also can exist in colors OTHER than green as well, though Green Emeralds are well known to represent a "universal color". In the games, the Emeralds have had many varying colors. As of recent (<i>Sonic Adventure</i>) these have been white, red, yellow, purple, aqua, green, and blue. Other known colors have been pink as well as the Gray Emerald - which was said to have some link in the creation of Doctor Robotnik...

<DD><blockquote>So far - only 7 Super Emeralds have been known to exist and only in 1 place: The Floating Island. These 7 "super" emeralds are larger versions of the regular Emeralds and surround the Master Emerald in The Chaos Chamber of The Floating Islands - Hidden Palace Zone...These emeralds can be used to access the Special Zone if you stand on top of them for a period of time...7 Chaos Emeralds plus 7 Super Emeralds and 50 rings will grant you access to "Hyper Mode", where you characters are now twice as powerful as they were before...

<DD><blockquote>Most likely The Master Emerald is the LARGEST Chaos Emerald in existance and is solely responsible for keeping the Floating Island afloat. When Doc Botniks Death Egg crashed into the island, it was this that The Fat Guy wished to use as fuel for his ship! This is also the item that Knuckles is sworn to guard as he does the entire island itself - for if the Master Emerald is ever removed from its pedestal, it would only be a matter of time before the Floating Island crashed into the sea...

<P><blockquote>
<UL>
<LI><b><u>Super Ring</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve 10 Power Rings in your inventory.
<LI><b><u>Blue Ring</b></u> -- Adds the Blue Ring to your inventory.
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/images/shield.gif" align=center>
<br>
<LI><b><u>Power Shield</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve the regular shield! With this you are free against 1 attack without losing your rings!
<LI><b><u>Flame Shield</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve a flame shield and access to the Flame Dash - one of the Special moves! With this shield you can be incincible to all fire attacks! The shield will dissipate if you hit water or electricity.
<LI><b><u>Electric Shield</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve a electric shield and access to the Double Jump - one of the Special moves! With this shield you can be incincible to all electricity attacks! The shield will dissipate if you hit water or fire.
<LI><b><u>Water Shield</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve a water shield and access to the Bounce Attack - one of the Special moves! With this shield you can have permanent air underwater and reflect most bullets by underwater enemies! The shield will dissipate if you hit electricity or fire.
<LI><b><u>Invincibility</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve temporary invincibilty against all attacks - except for getting crushed or drowning.
<LI><b><u>Power Sneakers</b></u> -- After popping a monitor box with this icon, Sonic can grab the Power Sneakers! Grabbing the Power Sneakers enhances Sonic's running ability as now he becomes TWICE as fast as his normal speed
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/images/rocketsneakers.gif" align=center>
<br>
<LI><b><u>Rocket Sneakers</b></u> -- First introduced in <i>Sonic Chaos</i>, these are the second types of Power Sneakers, in which Sonic will gain rocket boosters on his sneaks and fly in a straight line varied path for a limited time. Perfect for overcoming large pits and spike filled areas , and getting out of troublesome spots
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/images/1up.gif" align=center>
<br>
<LI><b><u>Extra Life</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve an extra life! Life can go up to from 9 to 99 men maximum.
<LI><b><u>Rotate Characters</b></u> -- In Knuckles' Chaotix, this causes your partner to become the player character, while the player character becomes computer-controlled (or controlled by the second player, if you are playing a 2-player game). The effect is temporary, but allows you to use different specialty moves for a while.
<LI><b><u>Change Character</b></u> -- These monitors show each of the faces of the 5 characters that you are not controlling.  For example, if you play as Vector and Espio, it shows Knux, Mighty, Charmy, Heavy, and Bomb.  The picture on the monitor constantly rotates from one character to the next.  Hitting the monitor will temporarily make the pictured character your partner.
<LI><b><u>Giant</b></u> -- A monitor with a large blue arrow.  Popping it will scale your character to an enormous height, or cancel the effects of a "Tiny" monitor.  The extra jumping height can be handy, but it's much harder to avoid badniks.  More of a novelty than anything useful.  You should be cautious until it wears off or you can find a "Tiny" monitor.
<LI><b><u>Tiny</b></u> -- A monitor with a small yellow arrow.  Popping it will scale your character down to a diminutive height, or cancel the effects of a "Giant" monitor.  You can't really do much until it wears off, because your jump height and speed will be tiny as well.  Mostly a novelty, it's only useful purpose is to cancel the "Giant" monitor's effects.  You should be cautious until it wears off or you can find a "Giant" monitor.
<LI><b><u>Zone Select</b></u> -- It's not really found in a monitor, but it is listed in your inventory with items that you got from monitors.  This very useful item is found in the Bonus Zone and gives you total control over which zone you go to next from the World Entrance Zone Select in <i>Knuckles' Chaotix</i>.
<LI><b><u>Character Select</b></u> -- Similar to the Zone Select item, but it gives you total control in choosing the character who will be the computer-controlled player in the next act.  It's not as useful as the Zone Select, since choosing the character you want is pretty easy.
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/images/blast2.gif" align=center>
<br>
<LI><b><u>Blast Shield</b></u> -- Pop this box to recieve the Blast Shield and the Blast Attack! The Blast Attack allows Sonic to literally home in on the enemy! Just jump in the air and press A!
<LI><b><u>Robotnik Monitor</b></u> -- Popping one of these boxes will have the same effect as a hit from a badnik.  Try to avoid them completely.
<LI><b><u>Teleport</b></u> -- Found in Sonic 2 in the 2-player Competition or as an available item in Debug Mode, this item switches the positions of Sonic and Tails.
<LI><b><u>The <i>Other</i> Blue Ring</b></u> -- Found only as an item in Sonic CD's Debug Mode, it is just like a Super Ring Monitor, but it gives you 50 rings instead.
<LI><b><u>Super Mode</b></u> -- Found only as an available item in the Debug Modes of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Sonic 3, and Sonic & Knuckles, this monitor has a glowing "S" on it.  It gives you 50 rings and causes you to become Super.

<DD><FONT COLOR="#55FFFF"><b>Tails' Items !!!</b></FONT>
<DD><blockquote>  
Being a major switch from traditional Sonic games, Tails Adventure chooses to go the route of the puzzler over action. In fact, it might even be considered an action-RPG in 2D platformer style. Starting the game off, Tails has nothing more than Regular Bombs, a 10-hit power bar (hits being measured in Rings, of course), and about two seconds on his Flight Guage. As the player travels through the game, he obtains a total of 26 weapons, about twelve seconds of flight time, and a 99-Ring power bar. Weapons are discovered hidden around levels, while power bar and Flight Guage are extended by discovering Chaos Emeralds (there are six in total), also hidden around the levels. 
As Tails' inventory increases, only four weapons can be brought into any level at a time. Often this presents a trial and error setup, requiring several trips into any one level to determine which four weapons need to be brought along for the trip. (The most useful items tend to be the Triple Bomb, Remote Bomb, Remote Robot, and Teleport Device.) And now here's a list of the game's 26 items and their individual effects: 

</center></center></center>
<P></blockquote><HR>

<blockquote>
<UL>
<LI><b><u>Regular Bomb</b></u> -- You start the game with these babies, and they're 
presumably Tails' key form of offense.  Blows up all enemies and your basic 
stone barriers.  
<LI><b><u>Large Bomb</b></u> -- Destroys all on-screen enemies, but takes several seconds 
to detonate after placing.  Also useful for those stubborn, thick stone 
barriers.
<LI><b><u>Remote Bomb</b></u> -- This handy little sucker will only detonate when you 
trigger it.  Not very effective against enemies, but a necessity on many 
puzzles.  Carry this item with you into nearly every level, as it's almost 
always needed...
<LI><b><u>Napalm Bomb</b></u> -- Throw this puppy on the ground to create a wave of 
flame that destroys everything in its path, including objects above.  It's 
the only way to clear through tall grass.
<LI><b><u>Triple Bomb</b></u> -- An enhanced version of the Regular Bomb.  Once you obtain 
this item, you'll never need the Regular Bombs again.  Naturally, being 
Tails' key form of offense, you'll need these in <i>every</i> level.
<LI><b><u>Wrench</b></u> -- The final obtainable item in the game, the Wrench's only use 
comes in the final level, where you'll be using it to work machines and 
reverse the direction of conveyor belts.
<LI><b><u>Helmet</b></u> -- By ducking under this giant bowl, all enemy fire will be 
reflected, and Tails will be safe from any damage.  Of course, you can't 
move at all while using it...
<LI><b><u>Remote Robot</b></u> -- <b>The</b> most important item in the game, barring only 
the Regular and Triple Bombs.  Once you snag this mechanical pup, pack him 
along to <i>every</i> level.  90% of the game's puzzles revolve around 
maneuvering the robot to open the path for Tails himself, so learn this 
canine's tricks early.
<LI><b><u>Hammer</b></u> -- Take out your frustrations on enemies and certain stone 
barriers with this fine mallet.  (Bean's bombs, Amy's mallet...what's next, 
Sonic's spin?)
<LI><b><u>Teleport Device</b></u> -- This is a handy little item that should prove 
extremely useful while exploring new levels to determine what items you'll 
need to pack along, as well as when returning to old levels to pick up items 
you couldn't reach the first time.  Warps you back to Tails' House anytime.
<LI><b><u>Night Vision</b></u> -- You'll need these infra-red goggles to light up dark 
levels.  I mean, unless you think you're good enough to play them in pitch

<LI><b><u>Speed Boots</b></u> -- Anyone who's ever played a Sonic game in his life (and I 
don't think you'd be here if you haven't) should be familiar with this item.  
Gives Tails the ability to run, and fly at a faster speed.
<LI><b><u>Super Glove</b></u> -- You can't have a self-respecting action-RPG without a 
Power Glove item, which naturally allows you to lift obscenely heavy 
objects.  It's yet to be explained exactly how wearing a glove raises a 
character's strength, but there are some questions better left unasked...
<LI><b><u>Fang Doll</b></u> -- Better known to US audiences as "Nack".  Everyone's favorite 
weasel gives Tails a lesson in Ring-pinching.  Carry this item along with 
you into any level to increase the chances that a destroyed enemy will drop 
a Ring.
<LI><b><u>Knuckles Doll</b></u> -- Bombs are OK, but sometime's it's just more satisfying to 
belt those bent birds' beaks in (there's a new tongue-twister for ya).  So 
make like everyone's favorite echidna and implant your fist into some face.
<LI><b><u>Sonic Doll</b></u> -- ...I had to say something.  Tails borrows Sonic's spindash with 
this item, although the control is more like that of a slingshot.  Like 
Knuckles' punch, it's more of a cute series tie-in than a useful item.
<LI><b><u>Item Radar</b></u> -- This time-saving piece of equipment will let you know if 
there's an item you missed still in the level.  If you don't get a read on 
the radar, don't waste your time.
<LI><b><u>Radio</b></u> -- While completely useless to gameplay, this beat-buster is the 
game's only trace of a sound test.  It just so happens that you can continue 
the level while jamming to your choice of tune...
<LI><b><u>Proton Torpedo</b></u> -- The Proton Torpedo is to the Sea Fox what the Regular 
Bombs are to Tails.  Your standard underwater weapon, they fire straight 
ahead.
<LI><b><u>Vulcan Gun</b></u> -- A smaller, rapid-fire version of the Proton Torpedo.  This 
is particularly handy in the Battle Fortress dogfight...
<LI><b><u>Extra Speed</b></u> -- Created solely for Lake Crystal, this boost-builder is 
the only way to get up that level's waterfalls.
<LI><b><u>Extra Armor</b></u> -- A starry forcefield protects the Sea Fox, making it 
invincible as long as this item is selected.
<LI><b><u>Anti-air Missile</b></u> -- This projectile shoots straight upward...handy for 
surprising enemies from below, and busting open barriers above.
<LI><b><u>Spark</b></u> -- Creates a strong electrical field around the Sea Fox, clearing 
the screen of all enemies and mines.
<LI><b><u>Mine</b></u> -- Like the Anti-air Missile, except you drop 'em below rather than 
shoot 'em upward.  Catch enemies from above, or destroy barriers directly 
below.
<LI><b><u>Rocket Booster</b></u> -- This attachment allows the Sea Fox to fly...the only 
way to play Battle Fortress 1.
