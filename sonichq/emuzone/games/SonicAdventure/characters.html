<h1 align=center><FONT COLOR="#ccccff">The Game Characters !!!</FONT></h1>

<p><center>The Sonic series has become an all-star cast of characters - not just the blue hedgehog that we've all come to know and love. While it began with just Sonic and Dr. Robotnik, Tails soon entered the picture, then Amy Rose and Knuckles. Now, Yuji Naka and his staff at Sonic Team introduce us to new characters - Big The Cat and The Ganma Robot Series - and a whole new villian - Perfect Chaos! But for Sonic Adventure, the artwork is a departure from previous titles. It's got a raw, more urban look to it that fits the series and takes it to the next level...</p></center>

<p><center>When the game comes out in the states and we get it you can come to this page for a listing of different moves and other things you can learn about that characters. </p></center>

He's blue, he's fast, and he's back in Sonic Adventure protecting Earth this time around from the evil clutches of Dr. Robotnik (Dr. Eggman in Japan). Sonic's design has changed somewhat, with green eyes and a larger buckle on those sneakers of his. He's still as fast as ever, and you'll begin playing Sonic Adventure as Sonic (duh).</p>

He's been Sonic's sidekick since the sequel to the original 16-Bit Sonic the Hedgehog. He's grown up a little bit more but he's still just a wide eyed kid running alongside of his big-brother Sonic! The kid who is exceptionally wise for his age has also returned with his bi-plane The Tornado - which has undergone a few changes of its own...</p>

Ever since Sonic 3, Knuckles - Guardian Of The Floating Island - has been on the scene, once even starring in his own game (Knuckles Chaotix on the 32X). Knuckles comes back to help Sonic out, and he can still use his climbing and gliding moves around Sonic Adventure's 3D worlds.</p>

Amy Rose - the little tagalong wannabe girlfriend first appeared in Sonic CD and has been on the heels of Sonic following her little obsession ever since - much to Sonic's trouble....BUT this time sh'e grown up a little bit more as well and has gotten a complete makeover. Ditching the "cute little girl" look for something more her age, she still may not be the best in fighting ability, but at least now she may have a fighting chance in her age bracket... </p>

The latest entry into the ever-growing Sonicverse, Big is just as his name implies. A large cat. A large cat living near the ruins who loves fishing, and carries a rod & reel with him everywhere he goes. His companion, Frog, one day happened to swallow a Chaos Emerald of all things, after which he mysteriously disappeared. Now Big is out to locate his little buddy, fishing pole in-hand. </p>

The second of the E-100 series of Gamma robots, E-102 is fiercely loyal to Dr. Robotnik, but is so of his own free will. Codenamed "Gamma", the highly accurate shooting robot recognizes Sonic as his "sworn enemy"...at least he "thinks so"....</p>

He's back, he's big, and he's bad - and this time he's got a partner in crime and his hands on the Chaos Emeralds: A BAD combination if ever there was one! Not only that - he's got a new weapon to add to his arsenal - The Egg Carrier! He's set his sights on Planet Earth this time and his first stop in his mad conquest - Station Square....</p>

The new guy on the block - Perfect Chaos IS the living embodiment of Chaos and the Chaos Emeralds itself in the form of a living liquid....Already having death on his track record with the destruction of an entire civilization, he won't hesitate to do it again and his partnership with the devilish doctor may just be something a little bit deeper in and of itself...</p>

Living right alongside the bustling human world, are the Chao. The Chao are mysterious creatures, with the ability to morph themselves into the physical shape of any other living animal. They also obtain these animals' special abilities, to create an infinite variety of shape, characters and movements. Are they somehow connected to Chaos? Its unknown at this time...</p>

They are the death machines - The new lines of "Super Badniks" thats sole purpose is to do one thing - ERADICATE Sonic The Hedgehog at all costs! Armed to the teeth with an arsenal that could level Cleveland they have no qualms about killing the hedgehog on sight. It looks like Doc Robotnik has finally created the perfect war machines.....Little does he know that E-102 has a slight glitch....

<p><center>Each of the characters will have its own strengths/weakness, and their own storylines that diverge from that of the others. Plus, levels played one way with one character will change when played with another. Should be very interesting playing through as all of them. The pictures are from postcards handed out to attendees at Saturday's Sonic Adventure event or scanned from japanese game mags. To learn more about the characters in Sonic Game Continuity go to our Who's Who page. The link to it will be put up on the big move to a new server - so you'll just have to wait! :o)</p></center>
