<p>We've been reporting on Sonic Adventure for weeks now. We've seen the premiere in Japan via the net, read interviews with Sega's president, Shouichirou Irimajiri, and Sonic's designer, Yuri Naka, and tracked down dozens of shots. Sonic Adventure keeps getting closer to its release, and yet Sonic Team keeps pumping up performance and adding more things to it. This time around, Yuji Naka and company have added people walking in the Station Square level and are adding detail such as papers that Sonic can pick up (and apparently swing at the camera). The people are a new mix to Sonic's universe, in a game that has never had any other human characters - unless you can call Dr. Robotnik "human." </p>

<p>Well thats all nice and dandy and yippee skippy - but just WHAT is Sonic Adventure? What separates it from "The Legend Of Zelda", "Super Mario 64", "Pokemon", "Tomb Raider", YADDA YADDA YADDA....Lets find out.</p></center></blockquote>

<p align=center>You begin the game as Sonic, and gameplay takes place in three main areas: Station Square - The city, The Mystic Ruins - Mountains, valleys, etc, and The Egg Carrier and Factory/Industrial Areas. The Ruin area, where a majority of the game is played, is based on South American Incan ruins; the Sonic team spent a good deal of time in South America surveying the landscape so that the game area had an authentic feel.</P> 

<p align=center>Stages fall into two categories: adventure field, where 3D exploration is crucial, and action field, where speed dominates. Two of the stages demonstrated at the Sega premiere were the Speed Highway Zone (an action field stage) and Red Mountain Zone (an adventure field stage). Speed Highway feels a lot like a 2D game played in a 3D environment, a simple solution to alleviate fears that Sonic would lose his Sonic-ness when he was drawn into 3D living. Now he has the best of both worlds. Sonic zips through the levels, performing familiar actions, like grabbing rings and squashing enemies along a fairly predetermined path. The camera angle was fixed (in much the same way it is in videogame Klonoa) to keep camera angles from bouncing EVERYWHERE. Red Mountain, however, provides you with a very different experience. At the demonstration, Knuckles makes his way through the stage, which was clearly not finished yet and had a few pop-up problems. But Knuckles' own movements were well done - gliding, climbing, and digging included.</P> 

<p align=center>Other stages we know about are Ice Cap, where snowboarding is key, the jungly Lost World, and the hot molten Lava World. You'll be tasked once again with collecting Chaos and Super Emeralds, and though we're not sure where you'll encounter them, it seems a safe bet that it will be, as it has been in the past, in the bonus levels. Sega's also thrown in a few minigames as well to enhance the flavor. The three we know of so far are a whack-a-mole type game, a shooting level with a biplane called Tornado, a fishing game with Big, and an air car-racing game. </p>

<b>

<p align=center>You'll be able to play through each of the stages with any one of six characters - and the stage will be altered for each character - adding significantly to the replay value. When the game opens, you're Sonic - and you have no choice about that, by the way - but as you encounter some of the other characters, that become playable - Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Big The Cat, and E-102 Ganma. </p>

<p align=center>Each of the characters will be voiced by a different actor to build up an identifiable personality and will obviously have its own strengths and weaknesses, which will affect how you play through a given stage. Additionally, judging by what Irimajiri said at the conference, we're guessing that some of the characters may be easier to play than others - hence his comment that the game can be enjoyed both by children and older people. Another character in the story is the newest supervillian to enter the Sonic universe and rival the deadly Doc Botnik - Perfect Chaos, the mysterious Chaos Energy based water monster that has killed an entire civilization and WONT hesitate to do it again...</p>

<p align=center>Perfect Chaos is not the only Chaos creature, however. The Dreamcast's Visual Memory System (VMS) is being called into play with creatures called Chao's, who reside in the adventure field sections of the game, the "A-Life" form that first showed up in NiGHTS. As you play with them and teach them things, they'll learn them and retain whatever you've taught them. Then, using the VMS, you can bring the Chaos outside the game and trade them with friends and like or bring them BACK into the game itself to use as a weapon or one of the rumored "ultimate racers", depending on how well you train it. </p>

<p align=center>Lastly, as far as the story aspect goes, the storyline in Sonic is supposed to play an important part in the game (that may be part of why the game was originally rumored as being called Sonic RPG). Each character is supposed to have his own story as well. For the moment, however, Sega's keeping all stories tightly under wraps. The game should have a number of cutscenes and CG movies, particularly as the story is reported to play such an important role in the game. </p>

<p align=center>Our first comes from <a href="mailto:"pthumble@access1.net">Segaholic2</a>:
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>Sega has done it before. In 1991, Sonic Team had brought forth their
first game, and Sega, an only moderately-successful company, was given
life, and for the first time in their existence, Sega was on top. 1995,
the Saturn. Sega needed a savior. Sonic Team offered NiGHTS Into Dreams
and kept Sega alive, if not very damaged. Now the year is 1999, and
Sega is in need of a reviver yet again. Sonic Team has come to the
rescue for the third time. The hibernation of the 'hog has come to anend.
When I turned on the Dreamcast I had rented from Hollywood Video, I
knew I was witnessing something great. The instant the incredible
opener for Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition played, I sat mesmerized,
watching the clear, incredibly realistic images of a city being
flooded. It took me a split second to realize the city was
Dreamcast-generated and not a real recording. I got chills down my
spines as I saw Sonic running through the forest towards the city,
going straight into a confrontation against his only fear: water.
That's the intro. Now for the review.

<p>GRAPHICS: 10
The BEST ever seen on any platform or PC! These are better than a
Pentium III 500 with Voodoo 3 3500 graphics accelerator! It took me a
while to realize that I was playing the game, and not watching a movie.
There are no polygons visible on Sonic, except on his hands, and I can
forgive that. There are some really beautiful visuals in this game. You
have to see it to believe it. The killer-whale chase scene in the
Emerald Coast Zone will absolutely knock you flat! All I could do was
stare while Sonic sped down a dock with this mondo whale right behind
him. Some other graphical highlights in this game include the Tornado
section of Windy Valley, the Goin' Down section of Speed Highway, and
the extremely cool-looking Snowboard sequence of IceCap. You can even
see Sonic's spines waving in the wind in certain levels, and the
characters' breath in the IceCap Zone!

<p>SOUND: 10
<p>I really enjoyed the BGM of this game. Each level had a perfectly
matched soundtrack to go along with it. The music is really top-notch
and real CD quality stuff. The sound effects are exactly the same as
the old 16-bit Sonic games, but less "harsh", if you know what I mean.
The sound when you blow up a badnik, however, has been changed from an
old "boing" to more of an explosion. On top of that, each character has
his own theme song, and some of them are pretty cool. Sonic's theme,
"It Doesn't Matter" totally rocks. I like it so much I figured out how
to play it on the piano! Even old Robotnik has his own theme! As for
the voice acting, it's also top-notch stuff. Sonic sounds just like I
thought he should. Tails' voice in my opinion is the worst in the game.
Knuckles sounds OK too, but sometimes his voice sounds too close to
Sonic's. Amy sounds like she should, as does E-102 the robot. At first
Big's doofy voice annoyed me, but after playing the game for a while, I
really began to love it! Especially when Big climbs ladders: "Duh-duh!"
Hehehe! Robotnik probably has the best voice acting in the game.

<p>GAMEPLAY: 10
<p>I actually got that same old exhilarating feeling of the old 2D Sonic
games again... *sniff* Sonic is so freakin' fast that you will not
believe his blazing speed! I was playing Sonic R against a friend the
other day; he was complaining that the game was too fast to control
Sonic while I was complaining that the game was too slow compared to
Sonic Adventure. This game is really huge. There are six characters to
choose from, and one hidden character. You can play as Sonic the
Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Big the
Cat and E-102 'y'. Sonic's game is by far the longest and most fun,
where you have a lot of levels to speed through and lots of bosses to
mash. Knuckles' game is really fun, where you have to find three
Emerald Shards. Tails' is kinda boring, 'cuz all you do is race someone
(usually Sonic) to the finish. Amy's game is rather boring and
sometimes frustrating because this giant robot chases you throughout
the whole game. I actually had a whole lot of fun with Big. I thought
Big's game would be boring from what I had read, but fishing for me was
very enjoyable! E-102's game is also pretty good. All the characters
handle very well, and are easy to learn how to control. There's even a
Tutorial Mode in the game to show you how to use each character!

<p>REPLAY VALUE: 10
<p>There are tons of mini-games and little diversions in this game, on top
of an A-Life system (fashioned after the A-Life system from NiGHTS,
only this one is more advanced). Some mini-games include pinball (I got
999 rings in NiGHTS pinball and only lost 1 ball; see if you can beat
that!), snow and sand-boarding, bumper-car racing, a Bi-Plane
shoot-'em-up, and much more! Plus six different characters each with
their own unique set of moves and abilities! You will not get bored
with this game!

<p>OVERALL: 10
<p>This is the most fun I've had in a long time. Most videogames aren't
even fun any more...they have become basically epics in which the goal
is to beat the game. With Sonic Adventure, it's an action-packed ride
all the way! I really look forward to buying this game and discovering
every single secret!

<p>RECAP
<p>The Sonic Team proves that they can deliver yet again with this gem of
a game. This is a total must-have for any fan of the original Sonic
games, or even just the platform genre, and this game alone is enough
to convince me into buying a Dreamcast, although I had made that
decision a long time ago. If you're getting a Dreamcast, buy this for
sure! If you're not, then I recommend that you seriously re-consider
that decision. Sonic the Hedgehog is BACK!
