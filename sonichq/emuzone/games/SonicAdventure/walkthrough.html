"The first thing that struck you as the game kicked in was to be the vast amount of depth and detail on-screen. The backgrounds are huge, and in the city landscape we saw was filled with incredible detail and thousands of objects. The automatic camera did a superb job of keeping up with the action and presented it always from a useable angle, but not always in the way you might have imagined. In one section, while Sonic ran down the side of a building, the camera followed the action but basically inverts, so Sonic is upside down at the top of the screen, heightening the dizzying effect. Excellent. The quality of the graphics did indeed surpass anything we’ve seen before -- though there was a very tiny bit of clipping in evidence in one scene, but it’s still early and the rest of the show soon made you forget that. This is a game that knows it’s 3D, no holds barred, with immense vertical drops which induced a real sense of free-flight falling, platforms bursting into the frame at all heights and angles, and enemies, collectable items, buildings and vehicles all in intricately-constructed polygonal splendor."
</P></center>

<p><center> - Quote From Next Generation Magazine</p>

<p><center> Sonic Adventure runs at an incredible 60 frames per second and at a high resolution of 640 x 480. The 3D levels are gorgeous and absolutely huge. The level of detail in each level is simply unprecedented. The texture quality is superb and evident throughout the levels of the game. All in all, graphics of this nature have never been achieved before on the PC or the home consoles. Here you will be able to find a walthrough of the game when we are able to get our hands on it. For right now - enjoy the stats and descriptions of zones! :o)

<center><H3>How This Page Is Set Up</H3></center>

<p><center>This page is set up like any of the other walkthrough pages to make it easier to browse. THERE ARE NO WALKTHROUGHS HERE !!! This way we wont spoil the game for you. Instead, located below are places for stats, first looks at zones, etc. Underneath the intro screenshot is some helpful info to get you acquainted in with what the zone will feel like and what you can expect later on. To save a lot of loading time on your part we only took some GOOD pics that we could find off of the net and didnt get the multititude of Sonic shots that have already flooded the internet. When we finally DO get our hands on Sonic Adventure - expect this page to become a walkthrough. But for right now have fun getting acquainted with what you can look forward to! Happy Searching! </p>

<p>Naturally - this will be the last section to go up. When we are able to get our hands on the game you will be able to click on the face icons below to access thier respective games OR you can choose to stay here and review the various zones to get a feel for them. HOWEVER DO NOT expect to see this section anytime soon as we don't want to spoil the game for ourselves or for you readers so were not even looking up that info yet.

<p><center><b>Sonic Adventure consists of three primary areas primary areas. Each of these three primary areas areas encompasses several sub-areas -- better known by longtime fans as Zones -- to create a total of 10+ levels, not counting chao racing ports, subgames, character minigames, and the Chao VMS game. The three main areas consist of:</p></b></center>

<UL><LI><p><b><u>Station Square</b></u> - A populated Cityscape area that acts as an "overworld" where Perfect Chaos and Robotnik make thier first move, and where Sonic and company are able to interact with different people ala "RPG villages". 
Station Square is the beginning area, holding the Speed Highway, Emerald Coast, Twinkle Park, and Casinopolis Zones. It also serves as the entryway into the Mysic Ruins. Explore and talk to people to learn valuable information.<BR>

<LI><p><b><u>The Mystic Ruins</b></u> - The largest of the playable areas in terms of numbers of zones and exploration and action sections, complete with mountains, valleys - hidden and open, an active volcano, and ancient ruins. 
Home to the IceCap, Red Mountain, Windy Valley, Hot Shelter, and Lost World. <BR>

<LI><p><b><u>Egg Carrier Zone</b></u> - The last and probably hardest of the three this is the headbase of Robotnik and Chaos, and where the characters stories begin to weave together. 
As far as I can tell, Robotnik's Carrier is home to the Sky Deck and Final Egg, as well as being a zone within itself. It may also have ties to the possibly named Sky Chase "Flying Zone" where you pilot Tails' bi-plane. Its unknown where the other "factory" levels fit in at this time.<BR>
</UL>

<b><p><center>Unfortunately, there's no trace of the Tails Factory Zone and Sky Chase which we know SOMEHOW exist in the game. Perhaps "Tails' Factory is part of another zone. We do not know.</p>

The first zone - a tropical island resort! Taking place along a stretch of prime beachside real estate, rather than the unpopulated shores of earlier Sonic games. It seems to resemble the Resort Island Zone (from Sonic R) more than anything else, with scattered islands and lagoons as well as signs of life, such as piers and grass huts. New to the mix are towering condos, standing in perfect harmony with trademark Sonic palmtrees.
It is also worth mentioning that the classic "checkerboard scenery" so associated with Sonic games is nowhere to be seen... </p>

<p><b>Speed Highway Zone</p></b>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
One of the zones with THE BEST graphics in the game and a showcase of JUST how fast Sonic can be on the Dreamcast. This zone greatly resembles Sonic CD's Stardust Speedway. A classic speed highway in an amazingly detailed Neon city there are lots of traffic and many big skyscrapers. This is the Zone that instantly comes to mind when someone utters the words "Sonic Adventure". That's probably because it was the first level unveiled to the public on August 22, the day of the Sonic press conference. It also serves as an excellent visual testament to the sheer power of the Dreamcast, with an unbelievably massive scope, a higher speed than even the fastest of today's racers, and lots of lighting effects...all at the promised 60fps. </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>As Sonic, the object is to speed through these mean streets, most likely passing various checkpoints within a given amount of time. Other screenshots showcase Sonic barreling straight down the side of a skyscraper, and Tails flying along the city skyline. This also seems to be the level where Sonic may FIRST go up against Perfect Chaos in the form of a Liquid Sonic... </p>

<p><b>Twinkle Park Zone</p></b>

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
One of the more recent additions in Sonicland are the amusement park Zones, which started in Sonic 3 with the Carnival Night Zone, and soared in popularity. (One could argue that the first theme park Zone was Sonic the Hedgehog 2's Casino Night, but that is better categorized in pinball-style courses, and represented in Sonic Adventure by the Casinopolis Zone.)</P> 

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Twinkle Park is obviously about colorful lights in a dark setting, and the result is one of the most beautiful videogame levels ever designed as far as we can see. Reminiscent of the old Disney lightshow parades on Main Street, but with features far more elaborate than anything ever done in those (the pirate ship inparticular looks very nice). It even comes complete with a rollercoaster... </p>

<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Its the return of the ever so popular pinball zones! And Casinopolis makes Casino Night look like the kiddie play area in a riverboat casino. A gambler's dream, this place has everything you'd expect from a high-class Las Vegas casino and then some, minus the showgirls. In order to advance, you must play a game of chance in the Main Room (the one with the big golden Sonic statue). If you win, you advance to the Strong Room (the one with all the gold coins). A losing hand lands you in the Shower Room (the one with the, uh...sewer like appearance...). Other rooms include the Green Room (backstage) and even a NiGHTS into Dreams room!

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
A lush, tropical jungle zone filled with waterfalls and spreading fauna VERY similar to the Jungle Zone and Meta Junglira Zone on the Sonic Game Gear games...No information is known on this zone yet, but I PERSONALLY have a feeling that it may be the outside of the Incan Ruin Zone area. Possibly, both are one in the same. I'm not sure yet...</p> 

<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Windy Valley Zone</p></b>

<IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Tower/4309/windyvalley.jpg">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Windy Valley pretty much defies description. This was one of the first zones where we are reintroduced to the "If Sonic picks up speed he can run on water" concept from Sonic 3! Visually, it isn't too much like any Zones you've seen before...in the whole "mountain lake" aspect it remotely resembles the Bridge and Azure Lake Zones from Sonic 1 GG and Sonic 3, but the similarities end there. The "windy" adjective comes from the numerous windmills, propellors, and other assorted fans that dot the cliffs. Looking at the cloud line, it seems that Windy Valley is infact the lower half of the Red Mountain Zone, which would explain why it isn't visible on the world map. Infact, they may even be the same Zone, perhaps two different Acts. Guess we poor US gamers will have to wait until September '99 to find out for sure...</p> 


<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Red Mountain Zone</p></b>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Unlike previous Sonic Zones of the same nature (namely Sky High and Hill Top), the ground isn't a pretty shade of turquoise, and the grass isn't quite so green. Imagine a very barren Hill Top Zone and you're on the right track. The trees are leafless, the grass is dead, and rickety wooden bridges connect the plateus. Giant propellors floating in the air add another interesting dimension to this stage, and give it an overall visual look unlike anything we've yet seen in Sonic. </p>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
One of the playable levels at the Fall '98 Tokyo Game Show, Knuckles' task in this Zone is to search out and collect the Emerald Shards - pieces of what seem to be a Chaos Emerald. He'll need all of his abilities to get them, including his classic gliding and digging maneuvers. His digging ability takes on a whole new perspective in the third dimension...

Sonic leaping the Ash islands floating on molten streams of red hot lava!!! Reminiscent of Sonic & Knuckles' Lava Reef Zone. Unfortunately no information is known on this zone as of yet except that MUCH of Amy and E-102's game take place here. POSSIBLY part of the Red Mountain...</p> 

<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
The "Ice Cap Zone" in Sonic 3 was arguably one of the most popular zones in that game - and this time its back, with a facelift and a vengeance....Despite the obvious visual similarities with the original Zone, Sonic 3's Ice Cap and Adventure's Ice Cap (neither of which are to be confused with Sonic Drift 2's "Ice Cap") can't be one and the same, unless the Mystic Ruin areas take place upon the Floating Island. Whatever the case, the third dimension treats this classic level well, flawlessy creating the eerily beautiful scenario of jagged, snow-capped mountain peaks, subterranean caves, and avalanches galore. Either a skier's worst nightmare or greatest dream, I'm not sure which...</p> 

<H3>Location #3 - Egg Carrier Zone</H3>

<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Tails' Factory Zone</p></b>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Very, very little is known about this Zone - even if it IS a zone. From what I can tell, it looks unique to Tails, perhaps even being his home/workshop combined. The large, rounded boulders and rock surfaces are very similar to those on Tails Island, the location of Tails' most recent solo game performance, <i>Tails Adventure</i>. It seems to be a factory/mining area sitting over a view of the ocean... </p> 

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Sonic is present in some of the shots too, but Sonic is present in every Zone. This level isn't shown on the scenario map, either, so it's possible that this isn't an actual Zone...but these screenshots didn't just come out of nowhere. Take a look and draw your own conclusions...</p> 


<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>

The final zone? Or just part of another cunning location in Sonic Adventure. Its unknown and technically TOO EARLY to make speculation. Gun turrets, High winds, jet engines - the madness of the Egg Carrier is just starting...Absolutely nothing is known on this zone so you'll just have to look and see for yourself on what to expect here...</p>

<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Final Egg Zone</p></b>

TECHNICALLY the Chao Gardens and the Chao Raceway are not a zone. BUT they are very much in synch with the A-Life properties that will accompany Sonic Adventure. Sonic and the others can communicate with the Chao through the special "Chao Garden" located in each Zone. Similar to NiGHTS' Nightopians, the Chao must be well-treated if they are to breed and multiply successfully. Good relationships with the Chao will be rewarded as they bring you items and will approach you as you pass. Mistreat them, and they will make faces and throw rocks at you like mad little children - which all in all would probably be a laugh riot! Whats the purpose - to earn "The Perfect Chao" who will turn out to be the ULTIMATE racer...For more information go to our section on Sonic Adventure <A HREF="http://www.emulationzone.org/sonichq/games/SonicAdventure/alife.html">A-Life and The VMS Uplink.</a></P>
