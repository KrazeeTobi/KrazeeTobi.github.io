<p align><b>Super Mario or Super Sonic? King Bowser Koopa or Doctor Ivo Robotnik? Whether its your cup of tea or your cup of poison - One thing can be said about mascots: they either make or break a company. Anyone remember the fiasco that was Bubsy The Bobcat? What about Aero the Acro-Bat? Tippy The Wonder Iguana? OK so thats a cheap Godzilla rip-off but still - :)
The Mascot Wars began the day Mario leaped out in his blue and red as he and Luigi set thier sights on revolutionizing the game industry!
Since then many others have followed thier footsteps - from hedgehogs to electric mice to a lttle yellow chomping guy named Pac-Man and his family that started the entire craze! So lo and behold - prepare yourself for "The Mascot Wars !!!"</p>

<blockquote>
First of all, before you go any further on this page lets get one thing straight - THIS IS NOT A FLAME PAGE AND WILL NOT BE TREATED AS SUCH ! 
Instead, I decided to keep this page at another angle more along the lines of comparing Sonic to other videogame and corporate mascots, be they well known or cheesy B-Movie creations like Krypto The Wonder Dog, and Beppo The Super Monkey. BLAH ON THEM ALL !!! :) All in all, this is gonna be the "fun" page! So in other words - DONT RUIN OUR FUN !!!!</p>

<p>So just what IS this page about anyway? Well - Along the lines of everyone who has ever played videogames, one question has passed everyone's lips: "If Sonic got into a fight with Mario, who would win?" Now you're probably thinking "A Sonic page thats doing this ??? Thier gonna be biased towards Sonic regardless!" Not so. Instead we decided to poke fun at the question and up the ante a little to this: "What if Sonic the Hedgehog and company got into a fight with EVERYBODY ?"
Be they a videogame icon or a cultural icon we want to answer that question in a way not to insult the other characters, but instead look at it humorously!
Can you imagine a fight between Doctor Robotnik and Team Rocket? Amy Rose VS Pac-Man? Batman VS Tails? The possibilities are endless...</p>

<p>So behold in all its glory...SONIC THE HEDGEHOG VERSUS THE WORLD !!! And Sonic HQ and videogaming in general will NEVER be the same again.... </p></blockquote>

<b><blockquote><u>Round One: Sonic VS Pikachu !!!</u></p></b>

<font color="#408080"> 
<p><b>Stats:</b> Its a sickeningly cute little electric rat with red puffy cheeks that screams its name out for a hug - but I'll be darned if that thing isn't one of the CUTEST creatures alive!!! Heck, Pikachu took Japan in droves and he's taken America in boatloads. You cannot HONESTLY have gone ANYWHERE on the planet and NOT have heard of Pikachu - its like avoiding a 20 Ton Mack truck in a dark enclosed alley. YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM THE ENDLESS WAVES OF CUTE !! IT WILL ENGULF YOU AND POSSESS YOUR EVERY BEING !!! BEWARE !!!! BEWARE !!!!! PIKA...PIKACHUUUUU !!!!!!! </P></center>

<p><b>Outcome Of The Fight:</b> I'm sorry, what were you saying? We were too busy hugging our Pikachu plushie! Wanna hear it squeak? Sonic's hugging one too! If the Sonic spines dont kill Pikachu, the electricty will kill Sonic - either way: Sonic loses due to cute overload and Pikachu loses cause of cute overdose. Stalemate.</P></center>

<font color="#990000"> 
<b><blockquote><u>Round Two: Sonic VS The First Season Superfriends !!!</u></p></b>

<font color="#408080"> 
<p><b>Stats:</b> The first season Super Friends. This team has four people with no super powers (five if you count Aquaman), and a snickering dog in a cape. And three of those people without powers are too young to buy cigarettes. The only thing even remotely super about this team is Super Man and Wonder Woman. And seeing as how Wonder Woman has absolutely no cleavage whatsoever and spends most of her time exclaiming "Great Hera!" like a big fat moron and every super villain out there in the known universe has kryptonite shoved somewhere up thier rectum, you'll find that this team spends more time teaching us valuable lessons through their wacky kid sidekicks than they do ever actually stopping evil. Sometimes they'll throw in a giant squid or something wet to discretely include water in the show to remind you about that little blond nobody that talks to fish. But those times are rare, and we're most often forced to watch Wonder Dog and Marvin get into mischeif for forty-seven minutes. And I'm not talking about defacing public property kinds of mischief. I'm talking about mischief more along the lines of, "Golly gee whiz Superman, what's in this radioactive monster containment room marked "DO NOT OPEN"? Let's open it and find out!" </P></center>

<p><b>Outcome Of The Fight:</b> Do we even really NEED to tell you the outcome? Heck - Hello Kitty could beat The Superfriends to a pulp and not even break a sweat. Sonic and crew would win this hands down provided they doesnt die of complete boredom first.</P></center>

<b><blockquote><u>Round Three: Sonic VS Crash Bandicoot !!!</u></p></b>

<font color="#408080"> 
<p><b>Stats:</b> Watch out for that belly flop! It'll get ya !!! Oh yeah right, 50 pounds of bandicoot lard streaking at you in a cheesy smile. AND MY GOSH WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH THAT DAMN EYE !?!?! The sucker looks like it wants just pop out and flop around silly like a lubricated salmon out of water! Seriously though, at his disposal Crash has numerous items such as a "scuba-jet" and a bi-plane along with a fashionably cool motorcycle and other small things at his arsenal. He also has his sister Coco to back him up as well as a cute pet tiger he used in Crash 3! Not Pikachu cute *shudder* but cute nonetheless. He even has a cool villian - Neo Cortex - even if he has a giant "N" branded on his head like a Holstien Cow. BUT he has something Sonic doesn't have - that dumb-butt moron in the Crash Bandicoot suit that does those lame Pizza Hut commercials. And WE ALL know that guy is about as funny as a limp noodle in heat. :)</P></center>

<p><b>Outcome Of The Fight:</b> In all honesty and fairness Crash is cool, yes. BUT he's doesnt have as much that Sonic has. LARGE amounts of friends, MULTIPLE numbers of Super cool villians, a morphing bi-plane to match his turbo prop with guns, And when youre comparing a belly flop to a Sonic spin that can tear through metal the outcome is kinda already set. Sorry Crash, but Sonic wins this one.</P></center>

<b><blockquote><u>Round Four: Sonic VS Aquaman!!!</u></p></b>

<font color="#408080"> 
<p><b>Stats:</b> BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry I just HAD to do another one. Holy useless plotdevices Batman !!! The guy wears bright orange underwear and talks to fish. Useless doesnt EVEN cover it. You'd think talking to squirrels would be more useful than that - Heck Sonic can at least mack on Sally Acorn (a squirrel in the comic) and get more clout than the Wonder Fish. Aqua Man basically spends his days hoping the writers will squeeze some water into the show to justify his sorry existence. And when there is water, he just sort of swims around with the little spazz Aqualad and his old pal Tusky The Walrus until he gets tired. Then he'll shoot out little happy yellow rings from his head and call a dolphin or something that he can ride like a surfboard. Aqua Man is someone you call when your pet goldfish Muffin is trying to kill you with a meat cleaver.</P></center>

<p><b>Outcome Of The Fight:</b> Sonic would be kickin arse and takin names!!! The Superfriends Aqua Man has the star potential of a basket of smelly laundry. Heck, the ONLY way for Sonic to lose this fight is for him to completely DIE of laughter. And even then he'd probably STILL kick his butt.</P></center>

<b><blockquote><u>Round Five: Sonic VS Sailor Moon !!!</u></p></b>

<font color="#408080"> 
<p><b>Stats:</b> MOON HEALING - ACTIVATION !!!! VENUS BREAST PLATES - JIGGLE !!!! Sailor Moon is pretty cool. WHINY AS HECK, but pretty cool nonetheless. But who cares about Sailor Moon - Give me Sailor Venus BABEEEE !!!!! And besides, what male in his right mind would turn down 6 Sailor Scouts wearing skimpy little skirts that turn nude every time they do a transformation. Yeah they edited out the nude transformation in America but a guy can dream can't he! And besides they have those long Sailor Sticks they use to transform - and I definetely wouldnt want to get hit by one of those suckers.</P></center>

<p><b>Outcome Of The Fight:</b> Sorry Sonic fans - Sailor Moon and the Sailor Scouts win. WHY? Because of one simple reason - <b>NO MAN ALIVE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH A WOMAN AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT !!!!!</b> It's just not possible, Adam couldn't do it with Eve, Sonic ALREADY can't do it with Amy and Sally, Samson couldn't do it with Delilah, Bert couldn't do it with Ernie (Even though he probably already did - HAW !!!), and men have been trying since the dawn of time and ALWAYS failed. Its just the natural order of things in life. And if Sonic has any sense - which we know he does - he'll just walk away slowly and agree with everything they say. Its the only way to leave unhurt. PERIOD</P></center>

<font color="#408080"> 
<p><b>Stats:</b> Lara Croft of <i>Tomb Raider</i> fame....She's got a nice pistol. Two pistols actually. Boy those are some biiiiiiiggggg pistols. Man just LOOK at those pistols. They just sit there and stare at you - BANG !!!! Ever hear of the phrase "pistol-whipped"? You could just grab those pistols and - </P></center>

<p><b>Outcome Of The Fight:</b> Sonic can win this - but not without a fight. All he has to do is get shot by her gun and blammo he's a goner, and if he succumbs to her other "pistols" even once, just glance at them - and he's a goner. In all honesty - just looking at Lara, all she has is the gun and her looks. If Sonic got the others to gang up on her with no mistakes among them - no contest...And besides, thats what separates Sonic from the rest.</P></center>
