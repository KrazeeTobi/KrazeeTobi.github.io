<div class=profile>She's the bubbliest member of the Freedom Fighters, always on the go, and Amy Rose's background is about as mysterious and not known to anybody except possibly herself. Amy Rose's origins lie in the country of Mercia, an Olde England like province of the Acorn Kingdom across the sea. There she lived for a while with her cousin, Rob O' The Hedge - leader of the Mercian branch of Freedom Fighters. When Robotnik took over, he made it his business to create several underbosses - the Mercian one being none other than Antoine's (another FF member) father - General D'Coolette--known as the High Sheriff! As things went from bad to worse, Rob sent Amy away to live in Knothole where she would hopefully be much safer. Since then Amy adapted to life and came to fall head over heels for the local hero - Sonic - where she assumed the position of his #1 fan and is ALWAYS on his heels! Sonic milks the adoration for all its worth but Tails is more or less indifferent to the whole thing - though he'll occasionally tag along with Amy from time to time on an adventure. As far as Sally's relationship with Sonic goes - Amy isn't all that hot about it at all really, but she stays clear due to respect of their relationship. If only she was a little older... Amy's biggest adventure came when Doc Robotnik discovered her and kidnapped her during his first unveiling of the Metal Sonic fiasco! Sonic rescued her and Amy popped up now and then - but with her being a little older now, Amy is now officially a full time member of the Freedom Fighters and follows off heartily on their adventures always ready to contribute a hand ! 
<p>However, now Amy is 'just a little older' after using the Ring of Acorns! She now has the equivalence of being 13 years of age.

<div class=profile><i>"Through time and space and alternate dimension, properties exist beyond comprehension. Artifacts of ancient and unfathomable power exist to aid and make men cower. Cognizant by beings of science and mystical shaman, a soverign royal and an emerald have nothing in common..."</i> In their own words - eons ago, the sun shone on the new world known as Mobius. Life began to evolve, centuries began to develop, and things began to go its course. But somewhere in between balance was shot down as the sky turned an emerald green - weather began going crazy, life began to either die out or fade - and those that survived saw the coming of the Chaos Emeralds!  They spawned worship, technological breakthroughs that drove those harnessing its energy completely mad, and in the hands of pure evil - they could be corrupted into weapons of complete destruction! But absolute energy cannot be created or destroyed and the infinite power of the chaos Emeralds shall realign for a higher purpose... The Chosen One who shall begin the great Gathering walks among them and the great harmony will then begin... Who is the Chosen? None other than Miles "Tails" Prower - and who deemed him so? None other than the Ancient Walkers - three mystical dieties that show up only when something GASTRONOMICALLY BIG happens in the Sonic Universe. Known to exhibit themselves previosly in the forms of dinosaurs - and now only in the forms of three floating tiki heads surrounded by a mystic energy, the Ancient Walkers speak in riddles and tongues, never revealing their secrets and always a mystery. In fact the ONLY thing that is known is that Athair - Knuckles' Great grandfather, and possibly Merlin Prower - Tails' uncle, are the only ones that have direct contact to the Walkers. Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails have been deemed "The Chosen Ones" and each have had thier respective meetings with Athair - Sonic and his Billionth Ring, Knuckles when he "died", and Tails' coming of age trip to Downunda as well as the first time he went "Super". Not even the powerful Mammoth Mogul was enough to stop Athair and The Walkers, and he has a Chaos Emerald slab embedded into his chest! For now the Walkers shall remain a perpetual mystery to all that know about them - but what their TRUE intentions are for Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails especially, have yet to be revealed...

<div class=profile>Mobius holds a mysterious secret, occasionally "zone portals" will open up out of nowhere and if you can locate a portal and get into it, you can access a mysterious "zone like" place known as the Cosmic Interstate! Winding along through space, from the Cosmic Interstate you can access a number of places from hidden zones to full parallel universes! In fact, there's one parallel universe that Sonic accidentally stumbled into - namely the Anti-Mobius Universe: home to one of his greatest enemies - Evil Sonic! Sporting tinted shades, a leather jacket, and black shoes, Evil Sonic may look like a hokey villian - but he's EVERYTHING Sonic is: only meaner. Basically a punk, Evil Sonic is the type that commands trouble at every second, and if no trouble is there - then he goes out to cause trouble just for the heck of it! Sonic usually manages to outsmart him if the two aren't beating each others brains out in a speed filled fist fight - but every time that Evil Sonic has come back: its always with a new twist! Leader of the Anti-Freedom Fighters, Evil Sonic terrorizes his universe's Mobotropolis constantly, while that areas Doctor Robotnik, a kind country doctor, can only sit and do nothing. The Anti Freedom Fighters are his personal "goon squad" and together they have even travelled to Sonic's own universe to wreak some havoc. At one point he went as far as to ally himself with the real Doctor Robotnik, which only resulted in him making a permanent enemy out of his rival - The Anti-Knuckles! But his biggest evil was none other than allying himself with The Robo Robotnik - another Robotnik from a parallel universe. Stealing an artifact called "The Giant's Hand" from an area in the Cosmic Interstate known as the Nuetral Zone, Evil Sonic was partially responsible for The Robo Robotnik's invasion of the various Sonic universes and his ultimate decapitation! To make sure that the Robo Robotnik - an evil possibly more worse than the original - never resurfaces, Sonic distributed parts of his weapon - "The Giant Borg" to the various Sonics of all the other dimensions, and another Sonic clone - Cyber Sonic kept Robo-Robotnik's head in the hopes that neither would never again be put back together. Since then Evil Sonic has been more or less a thorn in Sonic's side - but rumor has it that he's out along the Cosmic Interstate, stealing the Robo-Robotnik and Giant Borg components... and it's only a matter of time before he outwits the other Sonics and gets them all...

<div class=profile>Antoine used to be a coward in the beginning. It was very easy to make fun of him with both his French accent (Zee way ee spoke lieek thees) and his supreme cowardness--and Sonic took advantage of that many times. However, he's grown up from that and displays more courage than ever before. He may be still a coward in some areas, but ever since Bunnie revealed that she liked him, Antoine has had more confidence in himself and the two are currently an inseparable couple. Sonic doesn't tease him anymore and the two have a better friendship as well. His father, General D'Coolette, was captured and roboticized in the early days of the war against Robotnik. (More of him in his profile.)

<div class=profile>It was after the first meeting with the Chaotix that Archimedes met Knuckles - or rather it was Knuckles that met Archimedes. In a "test" of sorts, Archy "kidnapped" the Chaotix and held them "prisoner" in The lost Grand Conservatory where he awaited Knuckles to find him via various clues scattered across The Floating Island. It took Knuckles awhile but when he found him and the Chaotix they all had no idea of what was to happen next. As all this went on Enerjak - Knuckles Great Uncle - powered with 11 chaos emeralds was released from his tomb under the rocks of Mt. Fate and immediately took action - heading to the conservatory he separated Knux, Archy and The Chaotix - banishing Knux and Archy to the Sandopolis Zone and using the Chaotix as his mind slaves as he rebuilt Mt. Fate in the form of his twisted version of Echidnaopolis - Necronopolis !!! Since then, Enerjak was defeated by being shot into deep space but Archy has remained a sort of tutor to Knuckles - guiding him in the ways of the Chaos Emeralds and Master Emerald he protects.... but Archy has a secret or namely several. Fire ants live to VERY ripe old ages and Archy is no exception - under his training have been previous guardians: Knuckles' grandfathers Athair and Sabre - and even Knuckles' father Locke... Archimedes knew of Locke as well as the Guardian homebase - Haven: Location of the enigmatic Brotherhood Of Guardians, even though Knux thought them all to be dead. Knux now knows due to certain events that Archy was hiding a lot of stuff from him and as of right now Knux has become "too busy" to deal with him. This has hurt Archy a lot, but he still continues to render his services as needed. Knuckles may have his own agendas - but Archy, Locke, and The Brotherhood have other things in mind.... Archy is also a valued member of The Council Of Ants. The Fire Ant Council - which resides in the Lava Reef Zone serve as advisors to the echidna guardians in their time of need.

<div class=profile>600 years ago, Kayla-La and Jor-dann discovered a white comet on a collision course with Echidnaopolis, the Downunda city filled with echidnas.  While Kayla-La thought of a plan to raise the city into the skies, Arrakis pleaded for the echidnas to stay on the Mobius mainland where they belong and just to look for a new place to settle.  While the Echidna Council chose to follow Kayla-La's plan, Arrakis convinced the Council to allow every citizen to make their own choice of whether to go to into the clouds or to re-settle elsewhere on Mobius.  Arrakis lead those who decided to find a new home elsewhere.  Things were tough going for the echidnas he led, but the Ancient Walkers came to him one night and told him to find Albion--the place where echidnas sprang forth.  Arrakis was the first mitre of the Lost Tribe of Echidnas, who were mostly forgotten in history until Athair was chosen to be Mitre.</div><br>

Attacking in multiple groups and equipped with high fire laser blasters, Eggbots are usually under the employ of Snively - Robotnik's assistant - though Robotnik has been known to use them himself at times...<br><br><b><u>The Dynamac 3000</b></u> - The ULTIMATE Robotnik assault bot, the Dynamac can adapt to ANY given situation and manipulate himself to take control and turn him into THE MOST formidable opponent in the Bot Squad! In fact, Dynamacs are so powerful that the only way to really defeat them are by shorting them out with a massive surge of electricity! Not an easy thing to do for a bot that can anticipate your moves...

<b><u>Swatbots</b></u> - Usually found in the employ of Doctor Robotnik, swatbots are most likely found patrolling the streets of Robotropolis. Programmed with the "Priority One" code, when Sonic the Hedgehog is sensed in the area they will go on a red alert and attack at all costs. The weakest of the 4 bots, Swatbots are easily taken out by Sonic most of the time, but they still maintain and serve a good purpose to the Doctor when necessary.<br><br><b><u>Combots</b></u> - The Swatbot upgrade resulted in a new form of bot alogether - the Combot! The ultimate "army" bot, combots are used most likely in reconnaissance missions by Robotnik, but are under the constant employ of Crocbot - Robotnik's Downunda subboss! Empowered with the ability to "camouflage" themselves ala Espio the Chameleon, they literally can render themselves "invisible" and blend in with the background. Located in their hands they contain an energy lash which they can use to electrocute their victims, and also possess a large amount of guns and such in their arsenal. They feel most swatbots are "inferior" to them and are usually not afraid to say this... strange for one of the few "mindless" bots in Robotnik's employ.

<div class=profile>Athair was a guardian - but he is the only one who willingly gave up the role... out of the entire Sonic and Knuckles comics cast, Athair is the most mysterious character of them all - his past is so intertwined with Mobius' history, guardianship, Mitreship, and the Ancient Walkers that only he knows his whole story - period. Athair first met Tails on his trip to Downunda, infiltrating Robotnik's base there led by Crocbot. After being attacked by the Wing Dingo Squadron and left for dead, The Downunda Freedom Fighters took Tails to "the old man of the crater". Tails woke up to find none other than a wrinkled old man, bent over with a cane... deeming Tails "The Chosen One", Athair told him that now was only the beginning of events that were to play forth in the future. Athair beholded tales of Mobius' ancient past, the coming of the great Chaos Emerald meteor, and also revealed the secret that the "Great Downunda crater" was once the place where The Floating Isle sat before it rose into the sky... how did Athair know all of this? The Ancient Walkers - three mystical diety like beings that come in the form of giant tribal masks. When Tails awoke from his daze like slumber in the crater - he found every existance of Athair gone within the blink of an eye... fast forward to the coming of Mammoth Mogul - an ancient Wooly Mammoth with a Chaos Emerald literally embedded into his chest. After near-destroying Enerjak, Mogul, seeking to absorb the Chaos Emeralds of the Floating Island into himself - turned hyper and became Master Mogul: powered with the enegies of 12 Chaos Emeralds, it took Super Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, Turbo Tails, The Chaotix, The Freedom Fighters, the Echidna Security Team, and The dingoes - and NONE of the them could bring him down. That is - until Athair appeared. With the Ancient Walkers, Athair rescued Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails from dimensional limbo and dropped off the Chaos Syphon - the device used to create Enerjak. It was only with the syphon that the trio got the upper hand to defeat Mogul - but NOT before Athair vanished again.... So what is his relation to Knuckles and the guardians? It wasn't until weeks after the Mogul incident that Knuckles found out...Years ago - Athair himself was a guardian. Father to Sabre, Athair heeded what he called "a beckoning" from the Ancient Walkers. Following his call, he discovered The Forgotten Tribe - a group of Echidnas that decided to not go along with the decision to raise the Island. Simiar to Guardians, The tribe was led by "Mitres" instead. The most recent one had died - and Athair had just seemed to enter the picture. Out of sheer heart, Athair renounced the ways of the Guardian to help the poorer shambles that were the Forgotten Tribe find their "Lost City Of Albion", homeland to the echidna race that had vanished centuries ago. Athair took Knuckles to see the Tribe, and on the last night of his mitreship, he vanished mysteriously again. Knuckles - with the help of Rob O' the Hedge, an echidna named Yanar, and Rob's betrothed Mari-An, located the city after more than 600 years of the Tribe looking. Knuckles still wonders to this day - whatever happened to Athair - but had he looked in the sky, he would have seen clouds in the shape of Athair and The Ancient walkers that smiled down upon him...

<div class=profile>Just who are the Brotherhood Of Guardians? Lurking in the shadowy technological confines of Haven, The Brotherhood monitor the status of the current guardian of the Floating Island and manipulate and intervene with matters VERY DISCREETLY whenever necessary...To know them you must first understand that echidnas - particularly Guardians - live to be many ages old. To allow and train the current guardian, it is up to the father/mother to give them the basics for a certain amount of years, and then allow the Guardian to fend for himself/herself - such was the case with Knuckles. But something else stepped in to mess up the plans. Years of thoughtful planning and keeping themselves unknown to Knuckles, went down the drain once Echidnaopolis' pocket zone went crazy and reappeared on the Floating Isle. To keep the chaos down to a maximum The Brotherhood sent out their oldest member at the time, the centuries old Hawking to clear up the mess, and it was in this moment that Knuckles learned the partial history of his people. The main difference between being a guardian - and being part of the Brotherhood, is that whereas a guardian protects only the Floating Isle, each member of The Brotherhood discreetly monitors an entire section of Mobius. However - if trouble comes in, such as Robotnik's takeover of The Kingdom Of Acorn, they choose not to step in seeing as how "it isn't their problem", usually making them more hypocrites than anything else. </div><br>

<div class=profile>Bunnie Rabbot with her cute "lil' ol', accent" and sugar-sweet disposition, is not only the strongest of all The Freedom Fighters - but she's the heart of the group as well. Since being taught some martial arts moves from Princess Sally herself, Bunnie's been able to flatten a door with one kick, split a boulder with a judo chop and "just plain ol' pound some Swatbot be-hind." Bunnie still maintains her perky personality despite squeaking and clanking if her joints aren't regularly oiled...Bunnie's family comes from the Southern part of Mobius. Always optimistic she always lends a smile and will always try to cheer up the group when their spirits are down... She hates Robotnik with a heated vengeance for what he did to her though and would gladly kill him if she got the chance. Armed with a portable roboticizer, Swatbots captured and roboticized many southern Mobians, including Bunnie's parents. Bunnie escaped but was followed and later captured herself. It was there that she was rescued by Sonic and Rotor as the roboticisation process was halfway done. This has left Bunnie with her left arm and both legs roboticized and the rest of her body normal. She has gone through much emotional pain, yet she has matured into a loyal Freedom Fighter with exceptional strength and determination. Bunnie is DEEPLY in love with another Freedom Fighter - Antoine D'Coolette - and thier love for each other is probably the strongest out of all of the Sonic couples put together...

<div class=profile>Charmy Bee is the most sophisticated of the Chaotix... this guy knows his P's and Q's - perhaps that may be because he's also the reluctant Crown Prince of the Bee Realm! Charmy flew to Floating Island several years ago in search of new types of flowers - but that was all not totally true - yes, he did go exploring but there was a deeper reason as well. Charmy was a runaway. Not wanting to accept the Princehood forced upon him by his parents Charmy ran off to the Floating Isle, and only his best friend, Mello, knew. It was there he met Mighty first and eventually joined the Chaotix when he and the others helped out Knuckles save the Freedom Fighters. Only he can handle tricky problems in such a cool and charming way, making him an invaluable member of the team. Charmy's small size and light weight make him a difficult target, which is compounded by his ability to fly out of any danger. His unique Buzz-dash can tear right through the most powerful of Badniks with relative ease; and using Ring Power, this little honey bee is even strong enough to lift his friends into the air with him. And in many people's opinion, he is the cutest of all of The Chaotix. He can shrink himself in size when he goes to fly and enlarge his size in normal mode - but in all honesty he has the biggest heart of all the Chaotix, and is often found hanging out with Mighty or being the peacekeeper between the argumentative Espio and stubborn Vector. Briefly, he has now returned to his home in Goldenhive Colony and accepted his destiny as Prince of the Bee Realm as well as reconciling with the family he ran away from.

<div class=profile>Originally hailing from the rough terrain of Downunda - Mobius' "Australia" equivalent, Crocbot is probably one of the STRONGEST Underbosses Robotnik has. However he is also the largest evil streak - and would do anything in his will to not only dethrone Doctor Robotnik - but kill Tails at ANY COST. Especially seeing as how it was Tails who was responsible for destroying his body and fusing him permanently to his tank with a bomb! Upon reaching Downunda, Tails encountered the Downunda Freedom Fighters - a group of Australian FF's that sought to free to thier country from Robotnik's rule. Inviting himself on his quest after he was recued and taken to Athair - Knuckles' grandfather, Tails and Guru Emu - in an attempt to rescue one of thier comrades, Wombat Stu, let loose with a supply of Bomberangs. As Crocbot was hit with the bomberang, his tank skidded out of control and went flying into the Floating Island crater where the tanks nuclear core exploded. But Crocbot was NOT gone for good. After Tails left he set up his new base in that very crater! Taking his new army of Combots on loan from Doctor Robotnik, that area served as his base of operations until The Downunda Freedom fighters destroyed it and finally liberated thier country from his grip. This time Crocbot lost the entire lower half of his body, but he still wasnt through - he had managed to capture one of the Downunda FF's and implanted a mind control chip on him. It wasn't until Sonic and Tails came along on thier quest to locate Ixis Naugus, that Crocbot was finally stepped on for good. Taken in custody, Sonic took Crocbot's battered remains back to Mobotropolis only to have it stolen by part of Snively's gang in an attempt to revive all of Doctor Robotniks associates after his "death" - the possible purpose being: to fully rebuild him. Crocbot's wherabouts at this time, are unknown...

<div class=profile>Hundreds of years ago, back before the citizens of Echidnaopolis renounced technology there were rumors of a hooded clan that walked the streets and skulked in the shadows. They came to be known as Dark Legionnaires, and led by Menniker - the son of Enerjak, they came to be known as the infamous Dark Legion - that would terrorize the Floating Island indefinitely...that was - until they were banished to a prison-like area called the Twilight Zone by Steppenwolf - Menniker's cousin. Responsible for the death of the very first guardian, Edmund, the Dark Legion has hosted a centuries long visage of evil under the auspices of their benefactor Enerjak. They seek to bring back technology to an extreme rivaled almost by that of Robotnik himself. The ritual for induction is to replace a body part or certain area of your body with cybernetic pieces. With their hoods over their faces all you can see are thier yellow eyes and red shadows. They are like the "foot soldiers" of Enerjak except these are living people - making them an even deadlier threat... </div><br>

<div class=profile>Dimitri is the DEFINITIVE Knuckles villain, serving as the "Doctor Robotnik" of the Knuckles universe! While he is by no means anywhere near as nasty as Robotnik he can certainly run a close second! Serving as the Grandmaster, founder, and current leader of the Dark Legion, Enerjak (as he is also known) will do NOTHING to enforce his will of Technology above all upon the populace of the Floating Isle. However - from his perspective, he sees the Brotherhood Of Guardians as the natural enemies and hypocrites. Dimitri and his brother Edmund created the Chaos Syphon which was supposed to return the Floating Island onto the Mobius Mainland.  Instead it backfired and infused Dimitri with the emerald energy instead! Dimitri went positively insane with the power of 11 Chaos Emeralds howling inside him! He remained buried in an avalanche under Mount Fate for centuries until he was revived. There he rebuilt his "master city" of Nekronopolis - Echidnaopolis remade - until Knuckles and The Chaotix shot him into deep space (with unknown help from Locke). Thanks to Mammoth Mogul, Enerjak returned where he resumed leadership of the Legion from Kragok, his own grandson several generations removed. Enerjak didn't realise that he was a pawn in Mogul's scheme and after all those centuries of Chaos energy he could do nothing as every drop of it was drained out of him, reducing him to his true age - that of a shriveled old echidna that could barely breathe. Seeking to keep him alive, the DL somehow managed to infuse his aged body with cybernetic parts almost completely roboticizing him to some effect, and leaving VERY FEW bare spots visible! Hence came the cyborg we know today....Dimitri has an infatuation with Knuckles. Knux is different from the other guardians in mind, body, and spirit - and Dimitri wants to know why...</div><br>

The Australian equivalent on Mobius, Downunda is ruled by Robotnik's sub boss Crocbot. Tails discovered the Downunda Freedom Fighters after going head to head with Crocbot's Wing Dingo squadron. Taking him to Athair to be nursed back to health, the Downunda FF's show that they are just as caring as they are together as a team. So far, after Crocbot's final attempt at revenge by taking over the entire Platypus tribe only to end up disconnected, the DFF and thier country are currently free. But they still seek to rebuild so much of that which they have lost and often lend a hand to anyone whenever it is needed.

<div class=profile>This is the MAIN ROBOTNIK! The PRE-50 one. Doctor Robotnik is THE definitive Sonic villian - IN ALL ASPECTS, NO ONE has yet to top him in pure evil. Always surrounded by his large assortment of mechs, roboticizers, death machines, and anything that can harm - he can be defined as having 2 goals in life: Complete domination of the planet (which he has already achieved), and to make the life of Sonic The Hedgehog a living hell. In fact, he'd gladly kill him given the chance... Years ago, in the time of the Great War, a man named Julian was marked for death by his fellow Overlanders on the grounds of betrayal. Running away from the doom that awaited him, he and his nephew Snively took refuge with the benevolent King Acorn - who was already in dire need of help due to the worsening consequences of The Great War. Feeling that he could bring victory to the Mobians, King Acorn appointed Julian as Warlord in exchange for his knowledge of the Overlander armies. With Julian's charge, the Mobians won the Great War and in 3224, the last day of the Great War, King Acorn ordered the dismantling of the War Ministry and Julian's appointment to Minister of Science- just as Sonic's Uncle Chuck abandoned the post due to the roboticization of his brother...Julian, however, had other plans. He had actually stolen the plans for the roboticizer from Sir Charles, and launched a coup on all of Mobotropolis. Rechristened "Ivo Robotnik", he banished King Acorn to the Zone of Silence indefinitely, and took over the now rechristened Robotropolis. From then on Robotnik gained more and more power through treachery, until he had pretty much near total domination of the planet! He uses the roboticizer as his main weapon, turning the good people of Mobius into his mindless robotic slaves. He also has an endless army of SWATbots and Badniks to carry out his evil intentions. But there's always one thorn in his side - The Freedom Fighters, led by Princess Sally and championed by Sonic the Hedgehog! Thanks to them, and some evil doings on Snively's part, Robotnik died in an attempt to kill Princess Sally and wipe Knothole off the face of the Planet with the Ultimate Annihilator - a large electron gun controlled by satellites that can focus on anywhere on the planet. And when the Annihilator backfired Robotnik was wiped out of existence.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Drago Wolf was originally one of the prime members in the plot to kill Princess Sally! Once a member of the Wolf Pack Freedom Fighters, Drago was the wild card of group - usually the first to disobey orders and go off on his own tangent. But that led to be disastrous - Quick to act on his lust for the easy life, Drago soon came to ally himself with none other than Doctor Robotnik! Drago had a girlfriend - Hershey the Cat, whom he would also slap on abusively depending on his temper. Using his girlfriend Hershey as the fall girl, Drago persuaded her to go into Robotropolis wearing a Sonic suit claiming that he had "valuable information" on how to stop the Eggman's nephew, Snively once and for all. What Hershey DID NOT KNOW however was that there were optical fibers in the eye of the suit - making whoever she saw look JUST LIKE Snively! Not knowing of the Freedom Fighters' recoinassance mission into Robotropolis that night, as Princess Sally grappled the walls of one of Robotnik's buildings, Hershey - wearing the suit given to her by Drago - actually BELIEVED that she was seeing Snively, thus cutting the rope and causing Sally to fall to her near death. Meanwhile Drago looked on pleased as his plans had come to fruition. But as the truth was finally revealed to Hershey - that she was the cause of Sally's near demise, she could only cry in horror as she realised how Drago had manipulated her and sent Bunnie and Antione off to the Crocbot concentration camps of Downunda. Hershey finally lashed out at Drago for all the beatings and manipulation and nearly killed him by chucking a boulder at his head. Drago was soon captured and now has a hatred for both Hershey, Sonic, and Lupe, the leader of the Wolf Pack FF's - all three of whom he blames for the fact of his plans going down the tubes. Abusive and manipulative, Drago would gladly give anything to get his full revenge....

<div class=profile>Born in Dragonsnest, like all Mobian dragons, when Robotnik took over the planet, very few dragons escaped the roboticizer. But Dulcy's mother Sabina escaped with Dulcy to Knothole Village. Unfortunately, Sabina was eventually captured by Robotnik, and roboticized as well. Dulcy continued on in Knothole as a Freedom Fighter, as one of the last dragons on Mobius. She is very sweet, and has a child-like personality. Always eager to help, she often flies the Freedom Fighters all around Mobius whenever they need her and was an INTEGRAL part of freeing Sonic's name during the "death" of Princess Sally! Dulcy is a protector dragon, meaning she can breathe fire, and blow freezing ice, as well as the ability to sense truth in others. Also Dulcy is capable of terrific speeds when flying by snapping her tail in back of her, in a move known as "cracking the whip". Dulcy longs one day to roam the skies and be free once more, but as long as Robotnik reigns she can't do that in peace. So she forever looks towards a brighter future...

<div class=profile>Prince Elias' background comes from the far-off Floating Island. Way back before Robotnik's coup - during the Great War with the human like Overlanders, while Sonic, Sally, and the others were herded off to Knothole - Queen Alicia and a toddler boy named Elias were carted off to a safe haven on the Floating Island. However - en route, they were attacked and King Acorn feared his wife and son dead. He never told Sally so that "he would spare her", and possibly himself, the grief of losing someone she had never known. What was not known was that the convoy ships DID make it, but JUST BARELY as most of the crew died, barring Queen Alicia who fell into a near 10 year coma, Prince Elias - who remained unscathed, and one of the colonels under Geoffry St. John's father - who also passed. Discovered by the Guardians of the Floating Island during that time, they took in the Prince and raised him. While the Colonel stayed at the Royal Compound on the Floating Island, where the prince went to live at the age of 10.  The Brotherhood made sure to keep the Queen in stasis until she could someday be revived. Prince Elias thought his father died in the Robotnik takeover, King Acorn thought his son died in the Great War, and Sally - who was a child at the time - knew where NEITHER of them were. Ten years later - King Acorn finds word that that the Queen may still be alive and after sending The Secret Service to the Floating Isle, they came upon not only The Brotherhood Of Guardians but Prince Elias and the comatose Queen Acorn as well! Now the Prince has returned - and being the firstborn male, he has also been given the throne. The thing is - he doesn't want it.  Prince Elias is unsure of his role in a new world, with his newfound family. BUT he has seemed to gain a small sense of reliability with Sonic, and has tended to avoid Sally for right now, seeing as how she currently has issues with King Acorn. Only time will tell however, just how Elias will affect the kingdom AND The Freedom Fighters in the future... </div><br>

<div class=profile>Espio The Chameleon is often quite reserved and his past is a mystery to all except maybe Knuckles....Espio the Chameleon is quick and strong, and has an intense drive in everything he does. Nothing is known of Espio's past by anyone, but it seems that he lived a normal chameleon's life, until he met Knuckles. Then his world was flung upside-down with all the things he had to help his newfound friend with. But Espio has stayed a loyal friend to Knux and the other Chaotix. Espio's lashing Tongue Attack can whip the hardest of Badniks into shape, and his whirling attack can leave any opponents spinning their heads! His unique ability to run along walls and ceilings can get him out of any tight spots, and he can also change his color at will to blend into the scenery. Espio is very secretive in nature and kind of short-tempered just like Knux. He's serious a lot, but is willing to be friendly when he has too. Espio is a vital member to the Chaotix. He can often be found with the rest of the team in their adventures on the Floating Island but when he's alone, he likes to hang out in his invisible treehouse home in The Rainbow Valley.

<div class=profile>Serving underneath the auspices of Mammoth Mogul as his personal enforcers, the Fearsome Foursome first came upon the scene when Mogul reintroduced himself to the Chaotix as one of the Ancient Rulers of Mobius. Each one given thier own special powers, The Foursome are more than willing to carry out thier orders whenever necessary and are always ready to dish out whatever is commanded of them! After near-succesfully impersonating the Freedom Fighters and Chaotix respectively thanks to Mammoth Mogul's manipulation of Chaos Energy, The Foursome were finally brought down when each group figured out what was going on after all the confusion! Since then they had remained jailed up until Robotnik's break out of the Prison Cells at the Devil's Island Gulag. Wreaking havoc with Snively as current commander along with Warlord Kodos, Arachnis, Drago, and Slueth Dog - the Foursome helped out whenever necessary in the attempt to take back Mobotropolis from the Freedom Fighters, by kidnapping Nate Morgan. Currently they're roaming around as mercenaries basically until they can figure out just what to do, now that Mammoth Mogul has been imprisoned inside the Master Emerald...

Lynx is basically the show off of the group, seeming to be impulsive in action, but will take any order given to him. <br><br><b><u>Flying Frog</b></u> - The fourth and final member of the group, Flying Frog is the goofball, and you can tell it by his expressions, right down from the Buck teeth and long face to the slack jaws, Frog is the groups comic relief. Flying Frog does not "fly" per se but most likely uses the flaps connected to his arms and legs to soar against the wind currents sort of like what Knuckles does with his dreads.

<div class=profile>Several years ago, Fiona was among many other Mobian prisoners at an unknown base controlled by Robotnik.  She met Mighty and Ray (who were also prisoners) who attempted to help her when a robot guard said that "other plans" were in store for her.  Eventually the guards put down their rebellion and while Mighty and Ray were put in separate cages, she was taken to Robotnik himself.  Sonic, who was infiltrating the base at the time, freed Mighty and Ray and the three tried to rescue her.  However, when things didn't go according to plan and Ray mysteriously disappeared, Mighty started destroying the place by lifting machines like they were sheets of paper.  Robotnik abandoned the base during the confusion and took Fiona with him.  Robotnik made a robot duplicate of Fiona and then left her in a cell to rot.  She managed to dig her way out after awhile and she met Nic the Weasel.  The two became friends and stuck together until a recent run-in with Mighty.  Fiona has seemingly gone her own way as she hasn't been seen since.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Who is Fiona Fox? Was she a real fox once that was used as the basis for this Robot Duplicate, or is that all she is? It's unknown at this time...After the fiasco with Princess Sally and Geoffrey St. John, Doctor Robotnik deemed his newest creation - The Auto Automation's "unusable" due to their instant rusting upon contact with water - a fault in the metal and production. However, there was one chance that he could not look up. tails - frustrated over being treated as a kid by the Freedom Fighters - decided to run away and came upon an island populated by a single fox named Fiona. What he did know was that Robotnik knew of his "argument" with Sonic and decided to manipulate it to his best ability. Creating an island that was ACTUALLY a roboticizer, and using Fiona as bait, Robotnik planned on capturing tails and roboticising him once and for all! Tails developed a love for for Fiona, not knowing what she really was, and upon her taking him to her den, she trapped him in the roboticiser as Robotnik revealed his plan! Tails managed to shed enough hair by twirling his tails and clogging the combines. The roboticiser exploded and Tails escaped, but afterwards Fiona let loose an all out attack - and would have drowned him had the rusting of her metal not immediately taken place...Tails escaped alive and discovered plans to load of shipment of weapons to Crocbot. Determining to prove himself to the Freedom Fighters, he left to stop it, but not before saying his goodbyes to Fiona. And as Tails pulled away in The Sea Fox, a single tear fell from the eyes of the rusted robot on the beach where they fought. She still stands there to this day...

<div class=profile>Believe it or not, The Floating Island is NOT the only place to find echidnas...sadly the Floating Island echidnas have forgotten the existence of "The Lost Tribe". Centuries ago before the appearance of the Great White Comet threatened the echidna civilization of Downunda, the people were thrown into an uproar in a debate over how to handle the coming of the comet. While one side argued to use the Chaos Emerald technology to "uplift" a portion if the ground, another side simply ventured that they seek land elsewhere. Led by a radical called Arrakis, they took only the technology that was needed and fled the site only to watch while the Echidnas used the expirimental technology to uplift the newly christened "Floating Island" and barely escaping the Comet which exploded upon impact and shaped out the Great Downunda Crater. The tribe traveled as far as they could seeking out the fabled lost city of Albion, but as each step grew more weary the little technology they had fizzled out and the became the victims of Overlander attacks, hard luck, getting run off of land, and even later on into the years - Robotnik assaults. Similar to Guardianship, The Tribe is led by a "Mitre" with Athair being prophecised as its last one, but in his last days, Knuckles took command and helped them to finally locate thier lost city - almost a century later. The tribe has now been accepted into Albion, where they are finally happy and free from the dangers and hardships they once experienced... </div><br>

<div class=profile>Gala-Na is the leader of the echidnas of Albion as the head of their Echidna Council.  She dreams of the day when all the echidnas of Mobius live in Albion and hates the fact that the Brotherhood ignores her pleas to bring the echidnas of Echidnaopolis back to Albion.  However, in things that she can control, she will do whatever it takes to achieve her objectives.  The High Sheriff, who most likely did not even know Albion existed because of Albion's shields, was brought to be dismantled after Rob blew up his castle (though she didn't intervene when the High Sheriff was roboticizing other Mobians) since she felt the High Sheriff posed a threat.  Fortunately for Antoine who was trying to get his father back, Knuckles disagreed with Gala-Na's position and allowed Antoine & Bunnie to escape with the High Sheriff.  Unfortunately for Knuckles, by using his chaos powers to do it, he reinforced Gala-Na's fear of his powers so she attempted to have Knuckles' powers removed from him.  The process was interrupted by Charmy & Safron who couldn't believe that echidnas (that aren't Legionnaires) would be hurting Knuckles.  So in the end, all she accomplished was to enrage Knuckles and to cause his powers to increase even more.</div><br>

He can be hotheaded and is never hesitant to fight at a moments notice.

Stryker even assisted Remington in the fight against the Dark Legion and Master Mogul.  However, Stryker is tired of waiting for the Council of Echidnas to make good on their promise for housing for the stranded dingoes--who lost their city when Echidnaopolis returned--and was in the process of leading a dingo rebellion in Echidnaopolis as the Quantum Beam was fired sending everyone on the Floating Island into an unknown zone.</div><br>

Always refered the Freedom Fighters as "Sally's Trainees" or "Rank Amateurs," he used to "tag along" on trips occasionally just in case the FF's need his "expertise".  Geoffrey is actually good at what he does - now currently head of King Acorn's Secret Service. He's managed to tick off every FF from Sonic by accusing him of murder, to Antoine by accusing his father of being a traitor to the kingdom, and even to Knuckles by giving orders on his island! But the one person he shares a personal loathing for is Sonic the Hedgehog as neither of them can be around each other for less than 2 seconds without fighting like mad weasels! He resents this to all end and wishes one day he could have him out of his hair permanently to get what he wants - Sally Acorn - but due to the fact that he IS a good guy: which is doubtful - He'd never resort to those measures. Geoff also has a deep resentment for overlanders - it was overlanders who killed his father. So naturally he has VERY low thoughts of Nate Morgan - the latest overlander on the block...</div><br>

<div class=profile>Hawking was the Guardian of the Floating Island when the Dingoes, life-long enemies of the echidnas in general, launched a nuclear attack on Echidnaopolis.  Hawking used a dome shield to protect the city from the initial onslaught of the missiles, but the nuclear fallout threatened all life on the Floating Island.  Using plans from Dimitri, he created the Hyper Zone Projector and placed Echidnaopolis (along with all other inhabitants of the Floating Island--including the dingoes) into pocket zones.  While everyone was safe in their zones, the Brotherhood went about cleaning up the Floating Island and Hawking handed down the mantle of Guardianship to his son, Tobor.  Eventually, Hawking returned all Floating Island inhabitants back to the Floating Island, except for Echidnaopolis and the Dingoes.  Both returned thanks to the effects of Robotnik's Ultimate Annihilator, which erased all life on Mobius for an instant and broke down barriers between zones.  However, when Hawking did his part to save Echidnaopolis, he ended up in a coma, which he never did wake up from and eventually died.</div><br>

<div class=profile>A former member of the Chaotix - Heavy was created by Dr. Robotnik from special gems known as "The Power Gems". Designed to search and repair systems that had been damaged, he is an exceptionally versatile robot - However, Robotnik built him too well. The gems he used to give Heavy (as well as his partner, Bomb) conciousness, also gave them conciences and free will. Discovering that they were actually tools for the mad doctor, they wanted no part of it and together they escaped from Robotropolis with the gems in tow and went to the Floating Island where they came upon the Chaotix and the imprisoned Freedom Fighters! Little did they know that another creation - the Metal Sonic, had followed them also - and NOW HE TOO was poweredby the gems! When used, the Power Gems can accelerate metabolism so much that it can tun anything into a giant when used properly. So when Metal Sonic went on a rampage at Carnival Island - It was there that he turned into Super Metal Sonic, his gigantic large red form and threatened to stomp the Chaotix out of existance! Giving Knux a Power Gem, Heavy, Bomb, and The Chaotix watched as Knux gave the fatal blow that finally destroyed the Metal Sonic once and for all! Since then, they had tried to live a life of peace on the Floating Island but at the same time, wished to give back to the community that had accepted them so. The duo have no particular battle abilities but can defend themselves when together. Heavy is slow and clunky; and while Bomb is somewhat quicker, he's a total coward and will blow himself up at the first sign of danger. Heavy carries a metallic voice, but his concience isn't metallic. He hates Robotnik and will gladly help to defeat him whenever he's needed by the others, which is why Heavy and Bomb relocated to Knothole and are currently members of King Acorn's Secret Service.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Residing in the country of Mercia - Mobius' "England" equivalent, General D'Coolette - known there as the High Sheriff - may not be the strongest of Robotnik's underbosses - but he is the hardest case of them all. Long thought amongst them as dead, He's the roboticised father of one of the Knothole Freedom Fighters - Antione D'Coolette. Upon Sonic and Tails' quest around the globe to locate Ixis Naugus, Sonic discovered him by complete accident. Unfortunately - roboticization strips away a being of all its free will and personality - replacing the victim with metal instead of flesh. The General has no recollection of his son, Mobotropolis, or anything else of his past life - all he knows is his sworn allegiance to Doctor Robotnik and the "assimilation" of anyone that will oppose his will...He's even gone as far as public hangings to get his point across, making him one of the more ruthless villians. Sonic and Tails - with an assist from Knuckles and Rob O' The Hedge - leader of the Mercian Freedom Fighters - halted his operations from his castle for now by blowing it up. He is currently in Knothole after Antoine, Bunnie, and Amy Rose went to Mercia to try to get him and with an assist from Knuckles, they managed to keep Gala-Na and the Albion echidnas from dismantling the general.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Anyone familiar with Superman's nemesis Mr. Mxyzptlk , the reality warping imp from the fifth dimension, is bound to get a field day off these two. In a deliberate spoof on Superman's "greatest foe" - Al (The Short one) and Cal (The Tall one), are the epitome of annoyance in Sonic's universe. A group of troublemaking imps, Al and Cal hail from an area called the Unknown Zone and basically: all they ever want to do is play! They can warp reality with a single thought and it usually relates to nothing but complete confusion for Sonic and Tails. Either playing practical jokes on each other or thier victims or just spreading a little mischief, Al and Cal are basically screwy from the get go. However even they were not able to escape the madness that was the Ultimate Annihilator. When the massive nuclear powered weapon exploded "killing" Doctor Robotnik - it caused the buffers between Zones to literally break down, resulting in the creation of new ones, the destruction of old ones, or the mutations of other ones. The latter is what happened to the Unkown Zone - and when Sonic and tails were dragged into it yet again, they came to find that the dimension had now reverted into a complete warzone with a "roboticiszed" Al and Cal permanently locked in war: the complete opposite of thier previous incarnation. Sonic and Tails, after wearing off the effects of the zone on themselves, managed to escape without harm, but for right now Al and Cal's dimension is still "World War 3" and whether or not they managed to change the effects that the Annihilator had on the zone and themselves, is still questionable...

<div class=profile>After Robotnik "died" in the Princess Sally ordeal - many of the smaller villians came out of hiding to effectively test thier mettle. Ixis Naugus however - is NOT a small time villian...Whereas Robotnik is the master of technology, Ixis Naugus is the master of sorcery....Ixis Naugus is a sorceror extraordinare. In the time of the Great War, before the coming of Robotnik, he was the royal wizard in Mobotropolis during King Acorn's rule. But before Robotnik came along - another overlander had graced Mobotropolis and his name was Nate Morgan. Nate had used his science to in effect create Power Rings - a new clean source that worked off the powers of the Chaos Emerald. Using this new technology, King Acorn and Nate Morgan ushered the Kingdom Of Acorn from a medieval state and into a technological golden age! Nate was declared a hero, Mobotropolis was rebuilt and rechristened "New Mobotropolis", The Power Ring was declared the official "Fifth Element" of Mobius, and Naugus became horrifically jealous...With technology replacing magic in the Kingdom Of Acorn, Naugus was no longer needed and felt quite threatened. Using the already high "Anti-Overlander" sentiment growing in Mobotropolis and his ability to manipulate the minds of other people due to Black Magic, Naugus formed a pact with Warlord Kodos - Robotnik's predecessor and framed Nate for the murder of various animals that were assaulted by a troop of Overlanders. Nate was acquitted, but banished himself from the kingdom, and Naugus was safe. Then came Robotnik....Naugus created a new and strange dimension called the "Zone of Silence". With war raging, Naugus decided to explore and become master of the "Zone of Silence."  Eventually Kodos, Uma Arachnis, Feist, and even King Acorn pledged allegiance to him as Naugus reigned supreme.  While, King Acorn was rescued from the zone by Sonic, Sally, and Geoffrey, Naugus continued his reign.  The everything changed when Naugus, Kodos, and Arachnis escaped via one of Rotor's probes almost 11 years later after Naugus entered the zone. It was then that Naugus met Sonic and announced his plans to annihilate the Acorn Kingdom, destroy his objective - Nate Morgan, and absorb the raw energies of the Power Rings so that he can control ALL 5 of mobius' natural elements and take his place as ruler of Mobius! After a bit of globe-trotting, Naugus has finally been returned to the Zone of Silence, but no one knows if and when he'll be back.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Julie-Su is a mystery to everyone, even sometimes herself. Hesitant to share her past with others - the only thing that is known for sure is her connection to The Dark Legion - The mercenary group of Pro-Techno echidnas currently led by Dimitri! Formerly one of the Dark Legion's greatest warriors, Julie-Su left in search of Knuckles. She seems to have a smart-alecky attitude towards anyone and everyone, and though she is as tough as the appearance she puts on the outside, if you get to know her - she can be a good friend. She has joined the Chaotix's cause reluctantly - due to the fact that she'd spend hard time in the Echidnaopolis jail if she didn't, and only once reverted back to the Legion - mainly to keep herself from being killed by Kragok and Enerjak. However Knuckles and The Chaotix gave her something she never had before - true loyalty and friendship... Her loyalties may not be as obvious to Vector The Crocodile - who doesn't trust her one bit, The Brotherhood Of Guardians - with the exception of Locke who put in a good word for her - who thinks there's more to her than meets the eye, and her ex-Dark Legion compatriots - who have branded her as a traitor, but as far as Knuckles is concerned - She's fine enough for him.</div><br>

<div class=profile>King Acorn originally had Geoffrey create this "strike force" in an attempt to find out the TRUE fate of his wife, Queen Alicia, and his son, Elias, as the Brotherhood had hidden the truth for so long.  Successful in their first mission and with current peacefulness in Mobotropolis at the time with Ixis Naugus defeated and Dr Robotnik dead, King Acorn disbanded Sally's Freedom Fighters in favor of the Secret Service.  When Sonic and the Freedom Fighters went out into space and Robo-Robotnik attacked Mobotropolis, the team did what it could to evacuate the Mobians into Knothole--except for Valdez who elected to stay behind to hold off the Shadow-bots.  On her solo mission, Hershey discovered that Valdez had definitely been roboticized and was now a servant in Robo-Robotnik's army.  With Robo-Robotnik around, the Secret Service and the Freedom Fighters had been working together--yet separately in many cases--to try to reclaim Mobotropolis.  However, after Robo-Robotnik reprogrammed Heavy & Bomb and infested the remaining members with nano-bots, the Secret Service is off active duty for an unspecified amount of time.</div><br>

<div class=profile>King Acorn has led a life of tough decisions and harsh realities. It began around the Great War when he thought he lost his wife after an Overlander attack on the kingdom. After that came the Great Robotnik coup that would change his life forever as he ended up being banished to The Zone Of Silence for 10 years by Warlord Julian A.K.A. Doctor Ivo Robotnik !!! While there he also met with - Ixis Naugus, the once royal wizard (now completely mad) and creator of the zone Acorn had to spend his next ten years in! The effects of The Zone Of Silence are known to drive those in it to madness and the only way King Acorn could survive was by pledging fealty - and his kingdom - to Naugus with little or no hope of stopping Robotnik or ever escaping....Over time somewhere along the line the king lost total memory, and when Sonic and Sally came to rescue him they had no idea of what thier effects could cause. Prolonged exposure to the Zone Of Silence also brought along rapid crystallization to the body - Full crystallization meant instant death. Sonic, Sally, and Rotor managed to stop the process in time but for quite a while the king lay in a coma until Sonic probed his mind courtesy of Doctor Quack's Dream Watcher. The king is now fully uncrystallized thanks to the help of the magical Crown and Sword Of Acorns, but he has yet to realise that he is slowly distancing himself from the one person who fought so hard to save him - his daughter Sally. He's gone as far as disbanding the FF's (temporarily) and replacing them with the Secret Service, barring Sally from a relationship with Sonic, and giving the throne to Elias instead of Sally. Needless to say - The FF's don't agree with a lot of the decisions made.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Raised by his father from an early age to take on the responsibilities of guarding the Floating Island and the chaos emerald, Knuckles has gone through many problems - including thinking that he lost his father into the Forbidden Zone when he was only nine years old, fighting Sonic the Hedgehog on numerous occasions, multiple Chaos Emerald thiefs including Doctor Robotnik and Mammoth Mogul, discovering the existance of The Dark Legion, and even dealing with Enerjak - The ancient Echidna evil of history - who just so happens to be his great uncle several generations removed. But each problem he has overcome and has emerged greater, becoming fully worthy of his title passed down through heritage - Guardian Of The Floating Island. Knuckles is very brave, but VERY short-tempered as well. He's curious as to how his world works and what has happened to him though and is always hungry for answers to his many questions and he takes his role as Guardian of the Floating Island very seriously. Knuckles has made amends with Sonic and even though they operate on two completely different aspects - they each respect each other and often find that thier problems aren't really that much different. Knuckles receives aid in his duty as guardian from the Chaotix: Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee. It was with their help that Knuckles was able to stop Dr. Robotnik's plan to imprison the Freedom Fighters! Ever since then he found out that maybe it wasn't so bad having help around occasionaly - and the Chaotix are always there to back him up whenever needed! Always hot on the trail of finding out secrets relating to his past and heritage, Knuckles seeks to make a relationship with the man he never knew: Locke - his father, the mother he never got a chance to love: Lara - who just so happens to be marrying someone else after divorcing Locke, dealing with Julie-Su, a rogue echidna that once served the Dark Legion, dealing with his Great Grandfather Athair - the mystic that gave up his role as guardian, and coming to terms with the family that he really never got a chance to love. Knuckles' life is never easy or simple but he enjoys his job and honestly wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. When Knuckles collects seven chaos emeralds and 50 power rings, he becomes Hyper Knuckles! As Hyper Knuckles, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is also invincible to all attacks and glows a flashing hot pink color.</div><br>

<div class=profile>A large muscular lion with an attitude for everything and a spiteful hatred of overlanders, Warlord Kodos carries his Battle Axe wherever he goes and is NEVER afraid to use it...Originally the Minister Of War in the Kingdom Of Acorn, Kodos served during the time that Ixis Naugus was the Royal Wizard. Aiding Naugus in his his quest to frame Nate Morgan, Kodos' hatred of overlanders led to an attack of Overlander troops, which resulted in the deaths of part of his own ground troops, and Nate's eventual exile from the kingdom. Satisfied that he had no more overlanders to bother him, Kodos set about to continue his job. It wasn't until later that a young overlander named Julian Kintobor - later to become Doctor Robotnik - came upon the scene. When Kodos "disappeared," King Acorn gave Kodos' duties in the Great War to Kintobor - who was willing to shed his knowledge of the Overlanders and defeat their troops once and for all.  Kodos had sensed that Julian might want to take over the Kingdom and was planning on recruiting Julian and showed Julian the entrance to the Zone Of Silence.  Kintobor soon went to banishing his first obstacle, Kodos, in his agenda to fully take over the Kingdom ! Kodos survived his imprisonment in the zone until Ixis Naugus came along - and it was there that Kodos pledged fealty to Naugus, becoming his "hired muscle" of sorts, along side his second companion the female warrior Arachnis. Kodos holds a spiteful grudge against Robotnik, and an even larger grudge against Sonic and Sally - who are allies of the Kingdom of Acorn, and when it comes to death Kodos is QUITE WILLING to pass it out in doses - making him a deadly foe. Currently though it could be possible his death is upon us after falling within a ravine in the Great Forest. It's unknown for now if he's alive or not.</div><br>

Kragok hates Knuckles with a heated passion (which is mutual) and if you get the two in a room together they'll beat each other silly for hours and probably never stop. Kragok had been trapped in the Twilight Zone - the Dark Legion's old prison - along with Tobor, one of the lost guardians. However, when the portal to the zone opened up with a Dark Legion airship nearby, Tobor forced Kragok along with himself into the beam from the Quantum Cannon, which destroyed the cannon as well as killed them both.

<div class=profile>Lara-Le is Knux's mother. But she wishes she could have been more of a mother to him...You see a mother has almost no role in the upbringing of a guardian as all she did was basically give birth - and that it. This often led to many conflicts between her and Locke and overall their ultimate divorce. With the city of Echidnaopolis having vanished completely from the face of The Floating Island and trapped in it's own pocket zone due to a nuclear holocaust and The Hyper Zone Projector made by Hawking, the only traces of civilization were the "Marble Garden Zone" ruins left in its wake. Lara, as well as the city's inhabitants, had no way to escape the zone and thus so Knuckles went most of his life thinking that she was possibly dead. In truth - Guardians did have a way to exit back and forth between the Echidnaopolis Zone and the Floating Isle, and Locke often used this to his advantage. This meant that while Locke told Knuckles his mother was "gone," Lara could do nothing but sit trapped in Echidnaopolis without hope of ever seeing her son. It sounds cruel - but it certainly wasn't intentional...henceforth years later - due to The "Endgame" saga when Robotnik's Ultimate Annihilator exploded, it sent an omega wave of massive proportions all over Mobius, creating new zones, destroying some old ones, and breaking down the buffers protecting hidden ones. And one of those hidden zones now opened was none other than the lost city of Echidnaopolis! As Knuckles investigated, he came to face to face with his long lost mother. Currently they have established a relationship. Lara originally couldn't tell Knuckles the truth about Locke and how he was still alive and it broke her heart to do so. But that still doesn't keep her from trying to be an active figure in his life. Whether its talking to Julie-Su, or just dishing motherly advice, Lara cares the world for her son and is always ready to lend a shoulder whenever need. Currently she is on her honeymoon with her new husband, Wynmacher. While Knuckles still has problems dealing with the fact of a new stepfather, he also respects Wyn as well.

It continues to haunt him to this day because of his doomed relationship with Lara-Le, who he still loves. This does not mean that he does not watch over Knuckles. Before it was only behind a computer screen in the confines of Haven - home of The Brotherhood Of Guardians of which he is currently a member. Before Knux was born Locke had a dream induced by the Ancient Walkers, that foretold of a dark dismal future in which Knuckles went up against what looked to be a giant Robotnik robot. Its unknown whether Knux died in the dream, but Locke was so spooked over it that he went to his grandfather Athair for help. After Athair telling him of the coming of the Guardian Savior, Locke began to experiment on himself, and subjected Knux' egg to Chaos Emerald Radiation, thus making his son a "living Chaos Battery." Locke is still unsure if he made the right choice or not. For advice, Locke goes to his father Sabre, though he doesn't always follow it or agree with it. Due to the tradition of guardians - the youngest one was destined to be left alone and to fend for themselves. After protest from Lara - his wife, Locke began training Knuckles and one day Knuckles watched in horror as he entered the large wall of flames in The Forbidden Zone. Knuckles now knows that his father exists and is ALWAYS asking questions which Locke is usually hesitant to answer. It almost seemed as if Locke's entire world was crumbling around him - The Brotherhood is constantly arguing with him, and Lara - now his ex-wife has gone on to marry anew. If ever the phrase "too little, too late" was to come into play - Locke may be king definition of it.</div><br>

<div class=profile>As the leader of the Wolf Pack, Lupe represented the strong spirit of the team and lent a helping hand toward Sally whenever she could.  Lupe, in defiance of the general anti-overlander sentiment among Mobians, adopted two lonely overlander girls into the Pack.  Unfortunately when the Pack reached home to reunite with the family members they had left behind, the Pack was caught off guard and captured by Uncle Chuck, who was under Robotnik's control--the current Robotnik (not the dead one).  Lupe was roboticized, but she fought off the mind control long enough to enable the rest of the Pack to escape.  As the control was starting to take affect, she figured she would be better off staying instead of becoming a possible danger to the Pack.  In memory of her leadership and bravery, the Wolf Pack put up a tomb stone dedicated to Lupe.  She hasn't been seen since the incident.

<div class=profile>Mammoth Mogul was born eons ago a simple wooly mammoth that lived in the natural order of things, but his whole life changed when he came upon an unknown meteorite-like jewel that fell from the sky, embedded itself into its chest and granted him limitless power. He became master of all he surveyed, but was eventually dethroned by the other races of the planet. During the time afterwards, he discovered that the jewel he found was the most potent form of energy in the universe - the Chaos Emerald! With it he had evolved faster than any other animal on the planet and he was ready again after centuries of dormancy, to take his former position as Mobius' ruler. With Robotnik out of the way thanks to Snively and The Ultimate Annihilator, Mogul sought to take the Floating Island's Chaos Emerald, but failed realising the direct approach wouldn't work. Next he schemed to obtain the mystical Sword of Acorns - King Acorn's magical talisman that serves as an enery conduit capable of draining the powers out of anyone - or anything!...In his quest for power, it took the Chaotix and the Freedom Fighters combined to fully defeat him, but what they didn't realise is that in the end Mogul STILL had the sword and Sonic and Knuckles were left with the fake! With step one out of the way, his next appearance peaked as he drained EVERY DROP Enerjak's Chaos Emerald Power using the Sword of Acorns. Reducing Enerjak to aged dust, Mogul became super and reverted into "Master Mogul"! And infused with the power of 12 Chaos Emeralds with all but the Floating Islands emeralds left he went completely mad with power! After battling Super Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Turbo Tails, The Freedom Fighters, The Chaotix, General Stryker, and even with Athair and The Ancient Walkers stepping in, Mogul succeeded in getting into the Island's Chaos Chamber but had absorbed TOO MUCH POWER and thanks to Locke and Sabre - Knuckles' father and grandfather - he finally ended up encased forever in the newly dubbed "Master Emerald" - which consisted of a 14th Chaos Emerald with Mogul's life essence trapped dormant in its core! Recently, Mogul escaped from the core when RoboRobotnik (SA-style Eggman) shattered the Master Emerald.  Mogul hasn't been seen or heard from since.</div><br>

He saw some energy released and figured that his dad was asking him to continue his work.  While Menniker pretended to comply with the technology reduction put in place by the Echidna Council and enforced by Edmund, as the first Guardian, Menniker secretly rallied all the echidnas outraged by the Council's decision.  This group would become to be known as the Dark Legion.  After Steppenwolf exiled Menniker and his group into the Twilight Zone, Menniker and the Dark Legion eventually escaped.  Menniker planned a surprise attack on the Floating Island with the overlanders.  However, Aaron, the current Guardian at the time, accidentally discovered the plot and tried to disarm the missile when the overlander leader fired it.  Menniker jumped on the missile to stop Aaron but mentioned to Aaron not to press a button since it would cause the missile to detonate.  Aaron purposely pressed it, killing them both.</div><br>

Tails knows possibly NOTHING of him, and neither does anyone else. However - it has been hinted at in spoilers that Merlin may posibly know of tails' role as The Chosen One.

He and Sonic are close friends as they met several years ago in an unknown base run by Robotnik that they shut down with the help of a squirrel named Ray.  However, Ray went missing during that incident and it was only recently that Ray was rescued from the limbo he'd been in for years. Mighty joined up with the Chaotix when Robotnik threatened the Happyland Amusement Park. Since then Mighty has helped Knuckles much in his task of guarding the Floating Island and is loyal to Knuckles' cause as one of the founding members of "The Chaotix." Mighty also had his hand in being the first to meet Charmy Bee upon his venture to the Floating Island and introducing the bee to all his friends there. He can jump up the steepest of walls with ease, and when he kicks-off, he can take even the most wary of Badniks by surprise. Mighty likes to lift weights and brag a heck of a lot about his strength, but the dude really is humble, even if it doesn't show at times. He's very good friends with everybody and helps them whenever they need it.

<div class=profile>Mobie was found incased in ice by Antoine after an ambush of swatbots attacked them. Mobie is believed to be 8000 yrs old. After revived, he put up a fight and went in search for anyone he knew from 8000 years ago I assume.. Like they would be around. After recapturing him again and to help ihs problem with his sense of 'unearthly' environments, Uncle Chuck let Mobie off in the Mobian Jungle where Snively would wreak havoc with the the Eco-Destroyer. But would then suffer consequences. At this time, Mobie is most likely still residing in the jungle.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Many years ago, before the roboticiser, Robotnik dealt in the process of creating "cyborgs" - half animal, half robot. However Robotnik quickly scrapped that project due to the fact that none of the Mobian Monkeys could handle it, except for one - Monkey Khan. Robotnik had built him to be TOO POWERFUL and as a result he ended up with a hotheaded powerhouse that he couldn't control. Locking Monkey Khan in a metallic crypt in which he couldn't escape, Khan rested there for 10 years until Sonic, Sally, and Antione accidentally discovered it and freed him. Sonic and Khan hit off on the wrong spot IMMEDIATELY and as a result they ended up fighting each other more than anything else. However in the long run they parted as friends as Khan left to return to his native home of the Dragon Kingdom. It wasn't until a few weeks later that Sonic and Tails discovered him at the base of Mount Stormtop under the control of The Iron King and Iron Queen. They managed to free Khan from the grip of the Iron Queen as well as destroying her "Eternal Flame" spell that she had set upon Mount Stormtop. Khan decided to stay there among the simple villagers and live out his supposed destiny as prophecised "Monkey King" of the Dragon Kingdom. He defended the villagers from various attacks until Robotnik (SA-style Eggman) took him off guard and captured all the villagers and roboticized them all.  Monkey Khan has an intense hatred for all overlanders now.  When Sonic was trying to warn the overlanders--who had just returned after a decade in space--of the dangers of Robotnik, Monkey Khan's attack in blind hatred scared the overlanders and they went straight into the "safety" of Robotnik (who is currently secretly plotting the overlanders destruction as well as Sonic and everyone else on Mobius).</div><br>

<div class=profile>Moritori Rex was the grandmaster of the Dark Legion back during the eras of Guardian Hawking and Guardian Tobor (probably started earlier but those were his most important years). He had a son named Luger and has three grandchildren: the twins, Kragok and Kommissar (Lien-Da is her real name), and Julie-Su (who he rather have nothing to do with since she's a "traitor").  Moritori's claim to fame is that he figured out a way to spy on other zones without being detected. He used this ability to spy on Hawking and Tobor. Echidnaopolis had been taken off the Floating Island and put into it's own zone because of the dangerous radation levels from a dingo nuclear missile attack. Hawking went off to Haven and Tobor was now the official Guardian. Moritori decided to attack Echidnaopolis then and had a one-on-one fight with Tobor. He was losing the fight but he used his zone traveling device to take just the two of them to the Floating Island where some ruins collapsed on them. Then, Hawking searched the ruins for Tobor but he mistakening took Moritori instead thinking he had Tobor. Moritori then pretended to be "Tobor" and was a part of the Brotherhood and none of the Guardians knew anything was wrong. Unfortunately for Moritori Rex, the fact that the Brotherhood has kept Knuckles in the dark actually came in handy for when the real Tobor came back to the Floating Island after wandering Mobius in shame for decades. Things got worse for Moritori when Knuckles accidently found Haven and totally blew his cover (along with kicking his butt). Moritori Rex got some revenge back when the Dark Legion took over Haven, but they didn't get Locke or Spectre who both rectified that little situation. Currently he's a high level operative working under Dimitri, who is in charge of the Legion at the moment.</div><br>
