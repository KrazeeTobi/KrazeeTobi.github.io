<div class=profile>Amy Rose - the young hedgehog with a hopeless crush on Sonic! Sonic could do without her, but once she's got a hug in edgewise, there's no shaking her off!

<p>One of Sonic's biggest fans, Amy tagged along with him to Never Lake when Eggman tried to take control of the Little Planet in Sonic CD.  She was kidnapped by Metal Sonic to be the prize in its famous race with Sonic.

<p>After Sonic rescued her, Amy met him a few times in competitions, but mostly shopped around Station Square, where she has an apartment.  She didn't do much adventuring, until one day a bird flew into her groceries while she was daydreaming about her adventures with Sonic on the Little Planet.  The bird was flying away from Zero, one of Eggman's new E-100 series robots.  She helped the bird to hide, and protected it from Zero until meeting Sonic.  After getting kidnapped once again, she was rescued on the Egg Carrier not by Sonic, but by a mysterious and unlikely ally.  As she continued fighting Zero, she eventually became more independent and decided to win Sonic's respect rather than chasing after him all the time.

<p>Little Amy is more than just an annoyance. She's mastered the Lovely Kiss Attack, a charm move that confuses its receiver into a mindless daze. She has few redeeming hand-to-hand combat qualities, but her Magical Hammer can easily pound a few braincells out of any opponents with just a light swing. It's this colorful, oversized mallet that she used to hold her own in the Sonic Championship fighting tournament. Her "Pico Pico Hammer Attack" also keeps her path clear in Sonic Adventure. Amy also has two small cars that she uses for travel. The Breeze is a small blue car that almost seems to have a mind and face of its own. She's also got a red convertible, which she used in the World Grand Prix. It's lifeless and a little on the slow side, but it comes equipped with an automatic hover engine and a Turbo Boost!</div><br>

<div class=profile>Angel Island is truely a place of living legend in the Sonic universe.  Angel Island, like many magical islands in myth, floats in the sky, as a result of the energy released by the mighty stone known as the Master Emerald.  It is said that long ago, Angel Island was once part of a main continent, and inhabited by a powerful race of ancient people who used the Master Emerald to help build their great civilization.  But of course, a power such as this is bound to get to get to someone's head, and it did.  A group of elders attempted to steal the "Mighty Stone"'s energy, but ultimately wound up getting their entire race killed when the stone (or perhaps, something guarding it) exploded.  

<p>Then, according to <b>legend</b>, a god of the skies came from the heavens, brought back to life part of this civilization, and placed the Master Emerald, along with the land around it, into the sky, forming what we now know as Angel Island.  And by no means was this a small amount of land.  With over 12 zones, Angel Island is HUGE.  It houses all of the traditional animals (minus Picky), as well as a wide variety of interesting areas to explore, none of which are known better than Knuckles the Echidna, the last known remnant of the ancient race, and self-proclaimed guardian of the island, and the Master Emerald.

<p>Though the Master Emerald keeps the island afloat, it has been forced into the ocean before when it served as the crash site for Eggman's Death Egg.  The Master Emerald also cannot seem to keep the island up when it is in contact with the 7 Chaos Emeralds...</div><br>

<div class=profile>Charmy Bee is the most sophisticated of the Chaotix...this guy knows his P's and Q's! Infact, he's often the one who has to keep Espio in line. Charmy flew to Carnival Island in search of new types of flowers. It was there he met Knuckles and joined the Chaotix. Only he can handle tricky problems in such a cool and charming way, making him an invaluable member of the team.

<p>Charmy's small size and light weight make him a difficult target, which is compounded by his ability to fly out of any danger and to any altitude. Not only that - BUT his diminutive size makes it easy for him to get into many places unnoticed. Charmy, unlike the other Chaotix, doesn't spin.  His unique Buzz Attack, similar to Vector's Power Boost, can tear right through the most powerful of Badniks with relative ease.  He also has a unique alternative to the Spin-Dash, the Buzz Dash, which has the same effect but can be done instantly with no charging.  His flight range is unlimited, and using Ring Power, this little honey bee is even strong enough to lift his friends into the air with him.</div><br>

<div class=profile>In all of the Sonic universe, there probably isn't a character as complex as Dr. Eggman (known to some as Dr. Ivo Robotnik).  Don't let his foolish appearance convince you he has a simple personality.  His one goal in life is, for reasons know only to him, to gain ultimate power to take over the world.  The only thing standing in the path of his dreams of world conquest is Sonic the Hedgehog, who he sees as his fierce archenemy.  It is unknown when Sonic and Eggman first met, but whatever the case it seems no matter what he tries, Sonic and his pesky friends always find a way to ruin his plans.<p>
In order to gain ultimate power, Dr. Eggman must collect the 7 Chaos Emeralds, which hold unlimited mystic powers, beyond our comprehension.  Once he has these, the world will be his for the plucking.<p>
In order to keep anything from standing in his way, Eggman has created his own trademark robots known as Badniks.  These robots absorb their juice from the cute, fuzzy little animals seen hopping around various locations.  But no matter how strong his robots are, or how well his tactics are devised, he can never seem to bag just one victory, and always falls at the mercy of his arch rival and his friends!<p>
But there is one thing that can be said for certain, and that is no matter how many losses this man faces, no matter how humiliating the defeat, Eggman <B>NEVER</B> gives up!  No matter how fierce an opponant he sees the hedgehog to be, he never lets himself believe that he will lose!</div><br>

<div class=profile>E-102 "<font face="symbol">g</font>" was the second in Eggman's new line of advanced targeting robots, after E-101 "<font face="symbol">b</font>".  He was created for several purposes, one of which being to serve as crew to Dr. Eggman's new ship, the Egg Carrier, and to assist him in carrying out his latest diabolical scheme.  Gamma's first test upon creation was to face his brother, Beta, in combat.  Gamma easily defeated Beta, and proved his worth as becoming crew to the Egg Carrier.<p>
E-102's first mission, as with the rest of his "brothers", the E-100 series, is to retrieve a tailed frog.  After finding it in Station Square, he wins the admirition of Dr. Eggman, who then dismisses the other robots as worthless scrap metal and disposes them in such a manner. Gamma is then assigned to retrieve a bird from the imprisoned Amy Rose.  When ordering her to give him the bird, Amy refused, which confused him.  The bird then flew up to Gamma, and something came over him, something that wasn't in his programming.  In an odd display of emotion, Gamma releases Amy and the bird from their prison cell and tells them to escape. <p>
After being convinced by Amy to not kill Sonic and ignore Eggman's orders, E-102 escapes the now demolished Egg Carrier, and overrides his programming to give himself a new mission:  free the rest of his "brothers" by destroying their robotic shells, therefore releasing the little birdy trapped inside.  This mission eventually leads him back to the ocean bound remains of the Egg Carrier, where he squares off against a heavily upgraded E-101.<p>
After destorying each other, the birds trapped within E-101 and E-102 are finally released.  E-102 "<font face="symbol">g</font>" was completley destroyed.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Espio is quick and strong, and loves freedom. He has an intense drive in everything he does - when he runs, he charges head-first and doesn't look back. Espio is an even bigger showoff than Sonic, and almost as fast, matched in speed only by Mighty and Sonic himself.  His hot temper often leads him into rough situations, and his friend Charmy Bee sometimes has to remind him of his manners. 

<p>Espio values his freedom above all else, and holds a grudge against Robotnik for trapping him in the Combi Confiner several years ago. It was when Knuckles rescued him from the machine that Espio joined the fight against Eggman to protect Carnival Island.

<p>Espio's lashing Tongue Attack can whip the hardest of Badniks into shape, he can charge right through badniks at top speed, and his whirling attack - a tornado version of the standard spin - can leave any opponents spinning their heads! His unique ability to run along walls and ceilings can get him out of any tight spots, and he can also change his color at will to blend into the scenery.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Every Rogue's Gallery needs its wild card and Fang fits the bill exceptionally! Not much is known about Fang the Sniper, whom holds the "honor" of being despised by everybody from Sonic and Knuckles to Doctor Eggman! Fang loves one thing, and one thing only; the incredible driving force that we call cash.  He is known to double cross anyone at any time, and would stab his own family (assuming he has one) in the back for a profit!  Like all the antagonists, he's got his eye on those shiny stones they call the Chaos Emeralds; but unlike the rest, he's not after the Emeralds for their awesome power (of which he has <b>no</b> clue), he's more interesed in the gems' apprasal value.<p>
Also known as Nack the Weasel, Fang is a freelancing bounty and treasure hunter who will work for whichever side pays him more, but most often he'll just be working for himself. He knows every trick in the book, and a few that aren't. Though he may be clever, if there's anything he isn't, it's quick.  He gets around using a speedy little airbike called the Marvelous Queen, but he can also leap to lofty heights using his long tail as a spring.  He has a spiffy little popgun too!</div><br>

My duty is to guard the Master Emerald."</b></font></td><td height="200"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color=black>
<div class=profile>Knuckles is the only living descendant of a once prospherous civilization of echidnas, that mysteriously dissapeared long ago.  On their home of Angel Island, these people left many secrets behind, including what is considered one of the greatest treasures of all, the Master Emerald.  As the sole descandant of these people, Knuckles believes that it is his sworn duty to defend all of Angel Island, including the Master Emerald, from which the island draws its power to stay afloat in the sky.<p>

Knuckles has devoted his life to defending the Master Emerald, with which he has a mysterious bond, and as a result has become very isolated.  Even though he sometimes works with the Chaotix (Mighty the Armadillo, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee), he's a loner.  Isolated characters tend to be rough around the edges, and by no means is Knuckles an exception.  If anyone or anything threatens Angel Island, or the Master Emerald, they won't have much luck getting past this defensive, hot-headed echidna. He's also very gullable, and can be easily tricked.<p>

Knuckles first came into the picture when Eggman's massive space station, the Death Egg, fell smack flat on to Angel Island.  The good ol' Doc told Knuckles that Sonic and Tails, who had the seven Chaos Emeralds, were after the Master Emerald, even though it was really Eggman who was eyeing the pretty jewel.  When our heroes arrived, Knuckles swiped their Emeralds, and threw them into Special Zones.  Soon enough, Knuckles caught on to Eggman's plan (as in, when he <i>actually</i> saw him stealing the Master Emerald) and has been his enemy since.  Even though he and Sonic have long since buried any remaining hatchets between the two of them, Knuckles still doesn't trust him, or anyone else, when it comes to the Master Emerald.<p>

Occasionally - if time permits, he'll go down to the surface for a small amount of fun. Knuckles has his own speedy little racecar known as the Tempest. This orange, jeep-like vehicle is light enough to "jump" into the air with little force. When Knuckles collects all seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Knuckles. As Super Knuckles, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is invincible to all attacks, and glows a flashing pink color. When he collects all 7 Emeralds in their "super" forms, he becomes Hyper Knuckles.  With this form, he has the ability to destroy all nearby enemies by bashing into the wall, and brightly flashes the colors of the Chaos Emeralds.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Probably one of the most diabolical of all of Dr. Eggman's creations, Metal Sonic was designed to be the perfect match for his nemesis, Sonic the Hedgehog.  And by all means he was, and packs in a few more dirty tricks than his organic counterpart.  Metal Sonic's sleek design and size, unlike Dr. Eggman's first clunky and slow excuse for a Sonic clone, Silver Sonic, corrospond almost exactly to that of Sonic.  But more important, it is Sonic's speed that Metal Sonic can match.

<p>The first time Eggman tested his creation was on the Little Planet, where he pitted Sonic against his ingenius doppleganger.  Of course, regardless of pulling a few nasty tricks like electric shocks, inevitably met his fate by running into a wall.  It seems that the early version of LIPS A.I. couldn't keep up with his speed...

<p>After being rebuilt, Eggman upgraded Metal Sonic with the very special ability to transform into giant, red mutant version of himself, and used him in his attempt to steal the Chaos Rings from Carnival Island.  In this form, he packed a good punch, but it really defied the whole "sleek and fast" idea of his design, and in the long run made him no more effective.

<p>One more important ability Metal possess is to imitate the attacks of his enemies, a technique used mostly while guarding the Death Egg II.  Attacks Metal Sonic could use included Spin Attack, Propeller Dash, Knuckle Glider, Magic Hammer, Tongue Attack, Bomb Attack, Shoulder Throw, and Super Spin.

<p>Though Metal Sonic is a mindless drone controlled to obey Dr. Eggman's every command, he like other characters, enjoys kart racing now and again in his ultra speedy little car, the Blue Devil.  Of course, why he would need such a thing in the first place is quite confusing.

<p>For now, Metal Sonic rests within a tube in Eggman's lab.  But I seriously doubt this is the last we'll see of him.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Mighty The Armadillo is possibly the strongest of the Sonic cast. It's been said that he is as strong as Sonic is fast.  And his speed isn't bad either.  He's very clever but often tends to jump into many situations without thinking.

<p>Mighty may be most known as one of the memebers of the Chaotix but he also shares a bond with Sonic as it was Mighty, another associate by the name of Ray The Squirrel, and Sonic that thwarted a plan of Robotnik to capture Sonic on Eggman Island long before Sonic had met Knuckles. He's an old friend of Knuckles, and joined up with the Chaotix when Robotnik threatened Carnival Island and the Chaos Rings. 

<p>He can jump up the steepest of walls with ease, and when he kicks-off, he can take even the most wary of Badniks by surprise. He can also accelerate to great speed by kicking off a wall and hitting the ground running.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Born on the mysterious Westside Island, Miles Prower has never been just an ordinary kid.  Most notably, he was born with two tails, earning him the nickname, "Tails".  The other animals on Westside Island always made fun of Tails because of his unique oddity, and as a result Tails had been a very shy kid; that is until he met Sonic.<p>
When Sonic had first come to Westside Island, Tails immediately hid behind a tree.  But after he saw Sonic running so fast, he knew he just had to keep up.  He began to race Sonic around the island, that is until he saw <i>it</i> parked on the beach.  This mechanical monstrosity was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid his eyes on.  What he saw, was Sonic's plane, The Tornado, with which Tails, with his knack for mechanics, fell in love with instantly.  Since then, Sonic and Tails have bonded like glue.<p>
One of Tails' most unique abilities by far is his ability to use his two tails to fly like a helicopter rotor.  Tails uses this special little technique not only for himself, but to carry Sonic around as well.  He also uses it to propel himself when at top speed, floating over the ground.  Tails can use the technique offensively, too, flying up into an enemy or whirling his Tails when on the ground.  Tails is also unusually intelligent for his age and his talent with machines is equal to Eggman's.  When Tails gathers the 7 Chaos Emeralds in their "super" forms, he can become Super Tails.  In this form, Tails is basically just invincible, but he does seem to attract four "Super Flickies" who appear to give him a hand.</div><br>
