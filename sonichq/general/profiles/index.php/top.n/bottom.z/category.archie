<div class=profile>Nack would sell out his own Grandmother for a buck. Nack holds the "honor" of being despised by EVERYBODY from Sonic, Knuckles, and even Doctor Robotnik! Nack is VERY known to double cross ANYONE in his path and would stab his own mother in the back if he could find a profit in it! Nack the Weasel is a freelancing bounty and treasure hunter who will work for whichever side pays him more, but most often he'll just be working for himself. He knows every trick in the book, and a few that aren't. He gets around using a speedy little Ion-powered airbike called the Marvelous Queen, but he can also leap to lofty heights using his long tail like a spring. This dude is also known as Fang the Sniper.</div><br>

<div class=profile>In a place where Overlanders are at times hated and feared, Nate is the brightest exception. A small black male with a large glowing heart - Nate is the first person to have set the world of Mobius on its collective ear; him being one of the first people to learn how to master the art of Ring Forging...It all started back in Megapolis, home of the Overlanders. After creating the Ring forge,his assistant Julian Kintobor - better known later as Doctor Ivo Robotnik - sabotaged the Forge resulting in a massive explosion that destroyed a part of the city. No lives were lost, but Nate - being the head of the Geo-Physicians department of the Overlanders was brought in for trial and subsequently sentenced to banishment from the city. Possibly knowing of Kintobor's treachery - Nate took the Ring Forge and began his lifelong banishment. After crossing the Mobian Badlands tired, without food, and nearing death he had finally managed to reach the Great forest where he passed out after encountering a troop by King Frederic - Sally's grandfather. Barring complaints from those such as Ixis Naugus and Warlord Kodos about having an overlander in their midst, Frederic commanded that Nate be nursed back to health and in return for thier services, Nate asked to use his Ring forge technology and one of the King's Chaos Emeralds to help the medieval society of Mobotropolis. The outcome of this partnership? The birth of the city of New Mobotroplis, the declaration of the Power Ring as the 5th element of Mobius due to its innate properties, the ushering in of the Mobian golden Age - and a new life for Nate. From there Nate became official advisor to the king and an "uncle" to King Max as he first ascended the throne, and a teacher to the kingdom - even teaching Sonic's father and his greatest student: Sonic's Uncle Chuck, the art of forging Power Rings that he had held a secret for so long. But his happiness was not to last. Technology was replacing the ways of magic and sorcery - and this meant that Ixis Naugus - the royal wizard was now losing his edge on the Kingdom...Enlisting the aid of Warlord Kodos, already consumed with hate for the overlander, they set about a plan to frame Nate. While Nate and a group of students were out and escorted by Kodos and his troops, Naugus went about manipilating a troop of Overlanders in the Great Forest. And when both sides met, Naugus had used his magics to make the both sides turn it into a mini battle. Many of either side were either killed or hurt and when Kodos awoke in the hospital - both he and Naugus went on and on about how none of this would have happened had the king not entrusted the help of an overlander. It soon led to another trial in which Nate was acquitted, but Naugus had succeeded in his plan and the seeds of Anti-Overlander sentiment had already begun to grow. Not wanting a repeat of what had happened in Megapolis - Nate left Mobotropolis again to continue elsewhere. Dropping his Ring Forge in the <u>then undiscovered</u> Knothole Village "Lake Of Rings," Nate migrated to the southern tundra where he befriended a yeti that was almost dying. Healing the hurt beast and naming him "Eddy," they lived out thier days in exile in a castle atop a cliff. It wasn't until YEARS LATER that Sonic and Tails discovered them. On the trail of Ixis Naugus, now a fugitive to the kingdom, they learned his story and asked him to return with them to help make a difference in a city that was still dealing with the pain of Robotnik's takeover. With Nate's help and his HUGE Power ring cache, Ultra Sonic and Hyper Tails managed to seal Ixis Naugus - also enhanced by the rings back into the prisonlike Zone Of Silence. But it was at the consequence of one life - Nate's lifelong friend Eddy died in the battle. Sonic, Nate, and Tails returned to the kingdom and Nate - who came face to face with King Acorn after all those years, learned just what happened to his old assistant: Julian Kintobor, now Ivo Robotnik who had come along from his own banishment just as Nate had left the kingdom. Nate vowed to resume his post as advisor to the King and vowed to help him and the FF's in their times of need. And even though there are still those that show racist Anti-Overlander actions in the city: due to Robotnik's actions, Nate proves that not all overlanders are bad.  Realizing the danger the newly returned overlanders were in, Nate went to Robotropolis to try to save them, but Robotnik decided to use Nate as bait to trap Sonic in the city so that eventually he could roboticize Sonic.  However, just as Robotnik thought he had Sonic and the Freedom Fighters trapped, the shield-dome failed.  When Robotnik went to check out what happened, he saw Nate and knew what Nate had done and then roboticized Nate, who is now a statue (as the roboticization effect from Robotnik's hand on overlanders causes them to become inanimate).</div><br>

<div class=profile>A near sentient thinking, talking handheld computer Nicole is possibly the most special Freedom Fighter on the whole team. Why? She's from the future. She is a gift to the present Princess Sally from Queen Sally in the future! It is that that in the decisive battle with Doctor Robotnik, Nicole will be destroyed. Nicole was in fact created by the future version of Rotor years after those events happened. Commanded by King Sonic and Queen Sally, Nicole was sent into the past as a gift to help the Princess. But Nicole is more than a computer she is also a valued friend to all the Freedom Fighters as she is always there for Sally to talk to personally and has even saved Sonic from the grips of death and permanent roboticisation. Always full of info she is also a bit of a jokester as she occasionally likes to give Sonic a jolt of electricity when he uses her. As Sally put it "She is a gift to myself, from myself...A friend when I needed one the most" and without her they may never be able to see the day when Robotnik will be defeated or to fully appreciate Julayla's last words upon her death - "To thine own self be true".

<div class=profile>Far beneath the surface of the Great Mobian Ocean rests an underwater bot base - home of the malicious Octobot, a giant blue mech squid that serves as one of Robotnik's underbosses! In fact, Octobot's existance under the seas would have remained unknown to the Freedom Fighters had Tails not encountered him during the maiden voyage of the Sea Fox. Octobot hates Tails with a passion almost as strong as Crocbot and would also gladly kill him for virtually ruining his many plans. Discovering the underwater roboticisation factory once mainted by Jaws ( One of the badniks from Sonic 1), Tails destroyed the submerged base and left Octobot a complete laughing stock among the Bot community. However what Tails didn't know was that Octobot wanted revenge - and while on a mission to prove himself in Downunda, Octobot scuttled the Sea Fox by puncturing it with his drill tentacles and drug Tails beneath the ocean in an attempt to drown him. Tails was rescued by The Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters - a group of underwater FF's and later saved, but Octobot's fate during the rescue? Crushed beneath the massive weight of thier largest member - Fluke The Blue Whale. Octobot survived the incident - though somewhat flat - and hasn't been seen since: most likely stewing in his own juices over revenge. But it is known that he is not completely destroyed and still continues to hold a HUGE grudge against the guy that started it all - Tails The Fox.

<div class=profile>You think that Sonic's world is populated by all animals with Snively and Robotnik being the exceptions? Think again...Overlanders are in quite large abundance on the planet, but are only concentrated in small areas. Not making much interaction with the "mutated animals" of the planet, Overlanders are perceived as warlike, quite willing to kill whenever necessary, and often VERY dangerous. In fact this is the species that Doctor Robotnik and his nephew Snively hail from. Usually in Flashback sequences, The Kintobor family (Robotnik) seems to hold high position in Overlander society. In fact just like society today, their society operates like ours - only more contained and futuristic. there are judges, police, scientists, large armies, black people, white people, etc...the list goes on and on. For now the first person in Sonic's world that has proven the "sterotype" that all Overlander's are bad is Nate Morgan. The Great War against the Overlanders and The Kingdom Of Acorn before Robotnik's near planetary takeover, the Overlanders being responsible for the coma of Queen Alicia and death of Geoffrey St. John's father - even Robotnik's presence alone is enough to give them all a bad name. Anti-Overlander sentiment (racism) often runs rampant among the furries, but not all the Overlanders are villians, but not all of them are exactly friendly. Their origins on the Planet Mobius, however, still remain a mystery...</div><br>

Eventually the guards put down their rebellion and put Mighty and Ray in separate cages, while Fiona was taken to Robotnik himself. Sonic freed Mighty and Ray and the three tried to rescue her. However, things didn't go according to plan and when Ray touched the power stone, he mysteriously began to disappear.  Sonic made a mad dash to get him, but he didn't succeed. Mighty was very upset over the whole thing, but Sonic told Mighty to never give up hope.  When Mighty returned to the base recently along with Fiona and Nic, to everyone's surprise Ray was there still holding onto the power stone, but unable to escape.  Nic "freed" Ray by blasting the gem, and Ray went with Mighty to the Floating Island where he was introduced to Mighty's friends in the Chaotix.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Knuckles cannot be everywhere at once - especially since Echidnaopolis rematerialized on the Island. Guardians guard the island but underneath them are the Constables that leads the Echidna Security Team in Echidnaopolis - The current one being the lop haired Remington. Contemplative and easy to get along with, Remington gets his orders i.e Knuckles and also has a secret connection to enigmatic Brotherhood. Remington, who was trained by the previous Constable Holmes, acts as a police chief to Echidnaopolis - oftentimes recruiting The Chaotix to handle some jobs in town. Though he is by no means a true member of The Chaotix team he will help and often gives the orders in Knuckles' absence to them. A well known villain of Remington and the Chaotix are none other than the Drug Dealer and Mob Boss - Downtown Ebony Hare, whose LSD food poisoning case resulted in the death of Mello, the near death of Charmy, and put the entire Chaotix into the hospital. Remington seeks to make sure people like Ebony are never let loose into the streets again - and though he can be condescing at times, he keeps his place with Knuckles and does realise that IN THE LONG RUN - it is Knuckles that gives the rules...

<div class=profile>Renfield runs the Happyland Amusement Park on the Floating Island.  First he helped Robotnik lure the Freedom Fighters into a trap, which resulted in the formation of the Chaotix since Knuckles needed help to save them.  The next time he appeared he was using a "secret sauce" on the food served in the park to keep kids wanting to come back to eat the food at the park.  However, he wasn't in control of the operatiion as Downtown Ebony Hare took over and put Renfield in his place.  The dosage on the food was too high and resulted in Mello's death and putting the original four Chaotix members in the hospital.  After Remington and the Chaotix shut down Ebony's operation, Renfield was allowed to continue running the amusement park--WITHOUT the sauce (unless he wants Remington to arrest him as an accomplice).</div><br>

<div class=profile>Faraway in the country of Mercia there once was a band of Freedom Fighters that fought against a tyrant known simply as "The High Sherriff" - an underboss of Doctor Robotnik. Their leader, a hedgehog called Rob headed the Krazy Kritter Freedom Fighters and their fight for freedom went on - until distaster struck...The entire roster of the Krazy Kritter FF's fell to the roboticizer, leaving Rob behind to fend for himself against the sherrif. Rob sent his only relative - a cousin named Amy Rose - off to Knothole village where she would be safe while he kept the fort. Enter a couple of years later when Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails arrive. While Knuckles had come face to face with Athair, an associate named Yanar, and a group of "lost echidnas" known as The Forgotten Tribe, Sonic, on quest to find Ixis Naugus, discovered that the High Sherriff was really the roboticized father of Antoine D'Coolette, one of the Knothole Village Freedom Fighters. Taken prisoner by General D'Coolette, Sonic, Tails, and Yanar awaited their fate while Knuckles, Rob, and an echidna named Mari-An sought to find out what became of the passengers of Tails' crashed biplane and the now kidnapped Forgotten Tribe. Sonic and Tails, after their own escape, helped Rob to free what was left of the Forgotten Tribe and save Yanar from facing a sentence of a public hanging but in the end it was not enough to restrain General D'Coolette who managed to escape in an explosion. Sonic and company rescued their friends and The Forgotten Tribe and parted ways with Rob, vowing to return. Afterwards - while on a quest to locate the lost city of Albion with Knuckles, Rob discovered his true love in the form of Mari-An, the same echidna that assisted Knuckles before. Together the two stayed behind and continue to live in the forests of Mercia. And together they guard the Stonehenge-like entrance to Albion.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Everyone else on the team certainly represents something. So what does Rotor represent? Not only is he the brains of the group, but he's the glue that holds them together as well! A walrus inventor with high technical skills, Rotor is the only member of the Freedom Fighters who can fight Robotnik's technology WITH technology. Not being much of a socialite, like Sonic, Rotor keeps to what he knows: building anything he wants and fixing anything he can. Though he can program them, the one thing he can't fix are computers - they tend to backfire grossly on him most of the time. Because he is a fast-learner, he continuously takes things apart to learn how to put it back together. Sonic thinks of him as slow as a lava flow, but underwater -- zoom-- like a torpedo! As a valued member of the Freedom Fighters, Rotor has exceptional skills in mechanics and electronics. He has a very fast mind and can fix complex mechanical problems with ease. Having grown up next door to Sonic, the both of them being best friends, they escaped together to the palace when Robotnik took over - unfortunately, he was also separated from his parents as well. His mom escaped with his little brother (a baby at the time) to the arctic. Rotor's father and older brother (who he hasn't seen since), was captured and supposedly roboticized. Rotor misses his family a lot and is waiting until Robotnik's defeat so he can find them and they can be a family again. He won't speak out often when he disagrees with something due to his shyness, but you can tell that the loss of his family has hit him hard...</div><br>

She is serious about her work and is committed to her cause. While she can be annoyed by Sonic's attitude, deep down inside, she knows that somewhere she loves Sonic and he loves her. BUT neither of them will ever admit it though unless something really forces them to do it. Currently her father has been found and the person she once found herself fighting for - she has become more distant from....With the King either lying to her "for the good of the kingdom" or doing things such as trying to disband the FF's, giving the throne aimlessly to her brother Prince Elias, or keep her from seeing Sonic, the only reason Sally has yet to say anything mean is out of respect for him. A respect that she is slowly losing...</div><br>

<div class=profile>Now buddy buddy with Drago Wolf after their escape from the Devil's Island Gulag, Sleuth Doggy Dog was the original traitor to the Kingdom of Acorn! Serving in the Freedom Fighter's Spy Network, headed by Sonic's Uncle Chuck, Sleuth Dogg worked along side 2 other Networkers - Kicksalot and Fly Fly Freddy. What none of them knew however was that Sleuth was a double agent - working alongside of Doctor Robotnik! It led to many situations going wrong on reconaissance missions, such as Sonic getting captured and brainwashed, The Combots invading the Great Forest, and other such mishaps that involved the Spy Network. For the longest time - no one could figure out how Robotnik could seemigly anticpate much of their moves. And then came the dissapearance of Fly Fly Freddy....Upon a mission to gather Power Rings to the Zone Of Silence's crystallization effects upon King Acorn - Sleuth revealed himself as the treasonous traitor he was! Roboticizing Freddy, Sleuth and an army of Swatbots laid their attack at the Lake Of Rings in hopes to capture the FF's once and for all! Sadly, Freddy was shot down in the ensuing fracas, but Sleuth was brought down thanks the perfect timing of a Power Ring and the quick actions by Knuckles who had returned just in time to repay a favor. Sleuth was imprisoned and sentenced to the Devil Island Gulag for an indefinite sentence - but escaped along with the rest of the gang upon Robotnik's mass breakout! Currently he's on the run along with the rest of them - but with his tendencies to stab anybody in the back that comes his way, along with knowing a few Robotnik secrets, he can make a formidable opponent if necessary...

<div class=profile>Snively is the typical definition of the 1 pound weakling - this DOESN'T mean however that he's not a formidable opponent. Try as he may, he'll NEVER come anywhere near the status of his uncle Doctor Robotnik and he knows it. So what did he do? Simple - he tried to kill him. Assisting Robotnik in his takeover of Mobius at the end of the Great War, he served as Robotnik's second-in-command - a post once kept by a badnik named Crabmeat, which shows you just how low snively ranks in Doc R.'s eyes. However, the term "lackey" sometimes fits Snively better. He claims to have more technical and computer skills than Robotnik does, and often comes up with the some plans. The succesful ones, in which Robotnik winds up taking all the credit, and usually leaving Snively with all the blame when the plans go awry. At the same time, his long nose and high nasal voice often leaves him subject to ridicule from Sonic and the Freedom Fighters. Outside of dealing with Robotnik's wrath (and often Sonic's teasing), Snively secretly wishes for the day that his uncle is defeated by the Freedom Fighters. Then, he can take over for himself and show the world just how evil he can be. Changing the DNA-based organic coding in the Ultimate Annihilator so that it would only effect Doctor Robotnik, Snively successfully killed him. Unfortunately, afterwards he landed in jail until his escape amongst the other Sonic villains where he was deemed "in charge" due to his experience with Robotnik. Snively doesn't have the slightest iota of what he's doing most of the time and just now discovered that his uncle was VERY MUCH alive albeit "changed" (since it's a "Robotnik" of another zone--a zone where Robotnik defeated Sonic and all those who resisted him). Branded a traitor, Snively bides his time, but in the end will he be friend or foe?</div><br>

<div class=profile>Raised in New Mobotropolis before Robotnik's coup, Sonic was an average growing boy - exception being his abnormally insane speed which he worked on improving everyday. Sonic lost his parents to the roboticizer in The Great War, and was taken in by his Uncle Chuck, whom he lived with, until he too fell prey to the roboticizer during Robotnik's planetary coup. Helpless to stop any of the going ons as Robotnik took control of the populace, roboticized most of the Mobians, and took over the planet, Sonic and a few other children, including the Princess Sally, were herded to Knothole Villiage where they could learn, grow, and adapt to situations and eventually become a freedom fighting force that could one day defeat Robotnik and free Mobius! As Sonic developed his incredible speed, his attitude became legendary. Sonic is irreverent, confident, impatient and constantly bursting at the quills with energy. Above all, he's the bravest big-hearted hedgehog anywhere. It all comes down to loyalty, an important quality that this hedgehog is full of... among other things. All Sonic really wants is for life to return to the way it was before Dr. Robotnik took over, before polluting the planet and roboticizing everyone. And Sonic will stop at nothing to make his wish into reality. When Sonic collects seven Chaos Emeralds and 50 power rings, he becomes Super Sonic. As Super Sonic, all of his natural abilities are enhanced! His speed is so incredible that he actually hovers a few feet above the ground rather than running on it. He is completely invincible to all attacks. His color also changes from brilliant blue to shining yellow. The next stage in his transformation is Ultra Sonic - which can only be attained if he absorbs HUGE amounts of chaos energy almost turning Sonic into a living Chaos battery - literally trailing stars behind him and flashing with an atomlike glow. The final step is Solar Sonic - In this phase Sonic can adapt to any climate and his body litteraly adjusts itself to the geographical surroundings, giving him an assortment of all kinds of various powers depending on the Chaos Energy in his system and the location and area. In cold areas - Polar Sonic, in tropical areas Eco-Sonic, etc. And in normal areas, he resumes normal Ultra Sonic status with an advanced Super Sonic like form and a mix of powers.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Always friendly with his cousin Menniker, he helped out his father, Edmund, in enforcing the "new" technology guidelines for the citizens of Echidnaopolis.  However, unlike his father, he paid attention to the growing opposition which walked around the city in dark hoods.  When he was found out watching a secret meeting of this group, Steppenwolf managed to avoid the laser fire and get a boogie to escape, but the boogie was shot down.  He survived the crash and hid.  However, members of the group were looking for him and Edmund, who was looking for Steppenwolf, was shot & killed from behind when he attack two of their members.  After the members were gone, Steppenwolf cried over his dad's body and was eventually approached by the fire-ant called Christopheles.  Christopheles promised to help and trained Steppenwolf in the sciences, built up his strength, and taught him how to access the power of the chaos emerald.  Christopheles finally took Steppenwolf to a "secret" top of the line facility called "Haven."  Meanwhile, the warring between the followers of the Council new law and the Dark Legion (as it was finally known as) got worse.  Steppenwolf approached the Council and reminded them that there's always more than one option in whatever happens just before leaving to confront the Dark Legion.  When he approached the Grandmaster, he was very surprised to find out that it was his cousin, Menniker.  Steppenwolf still opened the portal to exile the Dark Legion though he didn't like it at all.  Years later, Brutus Kintobor came to the Floating Island with evil intentions, but Steppenwolf had the fire-ants mentally attack all the overlanders who ran away promising not to return.  This event caused him to allow his son, Moonwatcher, to learn about Haven as the two then alternated duties over watching the Floating Island and checking out the mainland of Mobius for any beings that might try to hurt the echidnas on the Floating Island.  He obviously went down in history as a very important echidna among the citizens of Echidnaopolis as many generations later Hawking would show Knuckles a statue of Edmund & Steppenwolf each holding up the Floating Island.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Usually found in the employ of Doctor Robotnik, Swatbots are most likely found patrolling the streets of Robotropolis. Programmed with the "Priority One" code, when Sonic the Hedgehog is sensed in the area they will go on a red alert and attack at all costs.

<div class=profile>Not much is known of Tails' background. Tails seemed to have been abondened after his parents were roboticized as a little kid, but Sonic found him and brought him into their family of Freedom Fighters when he was near 5 years old. Since then, he has grown older, now being able to go on many missions with the main group. His two tails has been of invaluable assistance to the Freedom Fighters as well. He often refers to Sally as Aunt Sally and thinks of Sonic as his big brother as well as a sort of father. Tails views Sonic as the only hero in the universe, and will always try to be exactly like him. Tails also is the Chosen One, as destined by the Ancient Walkers, to be the greatest hero of his time. Tails is outgoing and is the kind of person who can make a friend out of anybody, except maybe Doc Robotnik! He's also committed to his cause and gets very determined to do his job when he takes part in missions, resulting in an extreme bravery. When Tails collects seven Chaos Emeralds and 50 power rings, he becomes Turbo Tails. As Turbo Tails, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is also invincible to all attacks, and glows a bright orange-yellow color. The next phase in Tails' transformation is Hyper Tails, which can only be attained of he absorbs HUGE AMOUNTS of Chaos Energy! In this form Tails is aided by 4 Chaos enhanced Flicky birds that come to his aid and literally destroy and attack anything he wishes!</div><br>

<div class=profile>Tobor was the first Guardian in charge of Echidnaopolis after the nuclear attack incident on the Floating Island, which left the city in its own pocket zone.  It wasn't long before Moritori Rex led the Dark Legion, with its tanks and blasters, against the citizens of Echidnaopolis, armed with only farming tools.  Eventually, Tobor and Moritori went one-on-one, but when Tobor seemed to gain the advantage, Moritori used a device that transported the two of them into ruins on the Floating Island which buried the duo.  Some time later, Tobor heard his father calling his name, but soon realized the Hawking mistook Moritori Rex for himself.  After a day, Tobor freed himself from the rubble but with a feeling of shame, wandered the Mobian mainland where a doctor gave him cybernetic eyes to replace his failing real eyes.  Many years later, Tobor finally returned to the Floating Island and met Julie-Su, who he attacked at first, but allowed her to take him to met Knuckles, the current Guardian.  When Knuckles went to "interrogate" Kragok, Tobor eventually sensed trouble.  While the portal to the Twilight Zone was still open, Tobor made sure that it closed with him and Kragok in the zone so that there would be one less Legionnaire to contend with.  That same attitude was on display when the two finally managed to escape the Twilight Zone right in front of a Dark Legion aircraft, which was firing a beam that Tobor made sure to destroy along with Kragok even though he knew it meant his own death.</div><br>

Being a spider, she can cling to walls, shoot webbing, and can move around like lighning in situations - making her a quick and agile oponnent. She rarely speaks unless it is necessary, and the other villians often find her bewildering. Her true motives are known only to herself, and not even Sonic or Sally know or have any recollection of who she is or what she wants. For now she still remains as the second wild card, and until Ixis Naugus or herself reveal her intentions, for now she will slink back into the shadows behind Warlord Kodos and follow through her intentions - whatever they may be...

<div class=profile>Chuck has had a hard life. He and his brother Jules were once two of the greatest heroes to the kingdom - Jules being the brawn, and Charles being the brains they were practically unstoppable! That is - Until Robotnik came along...Charles was the Royal Engineer for the King and was given his title when he created the Roboticizer, a machine built to roboticize people's limbs lost in wars, accidents, and other tragedies. However, Warlord Julian ( Ivo Robotnik ) sabotaged the machine and made it so that it completely took away a person's will and roboticized them from head to toe. Charles didn't know of this deception, and when Jules was injured in the great war QUITE badly - Chuck roboticised him, and Jules was never the same man again. Stripped of his free will, he became a robotic vegetable - and the first in Robotnik's army that would come along later...Chuck blamed himself heavily and quit his job, opened up a chili dog chain raising his orphaned nephew Sonic - Jules' son - until Robotnik fully took over. Charles was later captured and roboticized in the Robotnik coup, and turned into a robot devoid of control just like Jules. However, thanks to Sonic, a power ring, and Charles own determimation, he broke control of his body away from Robotnik and served a spy for the Freedom Fighters. In the defeat of Doc Robotnik, Charles finally felt at peace with himself after helping clear Sonic's name of murder in the supposed death of Princess Sally. He still blames himself for the roboticiser but he's not as harsh as he used to be. But his story still does not end - To keep Robotnik from finding them, after Chuck regained his memory, his next step was to hide away Sonic's parents so Robotnik couldn't immediately dismantle them. When Sonic found out about this - once thinking his parents dead - he bacame extremely angry, but over time it ended up bringing the two closer together....Charles is nice to everybody and tries not to let anybody down. He belives the whole roboticizer ordeal is all his fault, but the Freedom Fighters help him to see otherwise. Overall, he's the Freedom Fighters "true father figure."

<div class=profile>Usually the FIRST member of the Chaotix to get into trouble - Carefree and happy-go-lucky, Vector never lets a serious situation get in the way of a good time (or his favorite song). This cool croc is never without his headset, even in the most dire of battles. If there's anything Vector loves as much as music, it's eating and speeding when he isn't jammin' with his friends or investigating the local food courts. It's not yet known exactly how Vector got hooked up with the Chaotix or with Knuckles for that matter as it seems the two have known each other quite a while....Vector's buzzing spin attack, whereby he rolls himself up into a ring shape, is not as quick as the usual Sonic Spin, but it does have a much wider range. His Power Boost move works like a jump within a jump, giving this cool croc some extra height. Vector lived a normal crocodile life on the Floating Island. Early on, Vector learned to love music and has been listening to the upbeat songs all the way through childhood. Now, he helps Knuckles out by guarding the island with him and doing other things he might need help with. Vector can get quite annoying at times with his booming walkman and his rap talk, but he's ALWAYS good friend to others - except maybe Julie-Su - and can help out a lot when he's needed. Vector doesn't exactly trust Julie - to tell the truth he can't stand her - and finds it his job to keep an eye on her. He deeply resents the fact that Knuckles seems to often spend more time with her and less with them, but he's slowly accepting it.</div><br>

Team Affiliation: The Wolf Pack Freedom Fighters<br>Current Member names: Reynard, Canus, Diablo, Leeta, Lyco, Aerial, Athena <br>Year Of Birth: Unknown<br>Age: varies among members <br>Base Of Operations: The Great Unknown And Great Canyon<br>First Appearance: Sonic #46<br><br><b><u>Lupe</b></u> - The leader of the Wolf Pack (currently roboticized and not with the pack), Lupe is the oldest of everyone, somewhere along the lines of 30 years old. Already married and with children, Marcos & Maria, Lupe left her home to protect the freedom of their people while her husband Lobo stayed home to watch the children. That alone shows you how strong of a woman she is. <br><br><b><u>Canus</b></u> - The second member of the group, Canus is the gentle giant. Large and burly, yet kind and well meaning, Canus serves as the strength of the group as well as its cook. He's mostly quiet and is the only member who can usually keep Reynard and Diablo from biting each others heads off. <br><br><b><u>Leeta And Lyco</b></u> - The third and fourth members - these pink wolves are the "identical twins" of the group. Both extremely acrobatic and wiry they work best as a team ALWAYS and are especially willing to help whenever needed. <br>

<b><u>Reynard</b></u> - Never one to spitefully lash out but ALWAYS one to question everything, reyanard was the person that first discovered Sonic, Sally, and Antione trespassing in the Wolf Caves. He's usually very inquisitive much to Diablo's nerves and this usually results in a tizzy between the two. <br><br><b><u>Diablo</b></u> - If ever there was a grump, Diablo is IT. Anyone remember Grouchy Smurf - give him fur and make him look like an animal and you have Diablo Wolf. This dark furred vulpine is the most stubborn and usually ends up getting into it with Reynard <br><br><b><u>Aerial and Athena</b></u> - The final members of the group came MUCH LATER and caused quite an uproar aong the Wolf Pack when they came along. You see, Aerial and her sister Athena are two overlander girls. Athena being deaf, and Aerial being fully talkative, both are the lone survivors of a forgotten Overlander City... <br><br><b><u>Drago</b></u> - (No longer a freedom fighter) Needless to say, Drago WAS the traitor (suspected by Lupe) in the "Death Of Princess Sally" and has become a shame to the Wolf Pack
