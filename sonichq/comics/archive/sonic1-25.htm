                      unleashes E.V.E. ["Exceptionally Versatile Evolvanoids"] 
                      to capture Sonic. As Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it 
                      simply adapts to another form to compensate. Sonic lures 
                      it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a self-conscious 
                      form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back by its 
                      biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e., individual 
                      cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. So E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, 
                      but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic E.V.E. him and 
                      travels out into space on a journey of self-actualization. 
                      Is Robotnik really history? That's the tease--So you'll 
                      just have to wait until next issue to find out...</font></p>
