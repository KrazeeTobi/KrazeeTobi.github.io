                      Dr. Robotnik, even if it goes against King Max's wishes. 
                      After their latest escapades, the king finally orders Sonic 
                      to his chambers. What fate awaits him? Meanwhile, Sally 
                      has a tearful reunion of sorts with Alicia, who sleeps peacefully 
                      in her cryogenic tube. And what's this lurking on the horizon? 
                      Could Overlander vessels be heading for Mobius?</font></p>

                      A defining moment for Sonic and his friends as Sonic is 
                      finally knighted and King Max declares the formation of 
                      the Kingdom of Knothole - a state that will serve as a [haven] 
                      for all Mobians who wish to live free of Robotnik's tyranny. 
                      Furthermore, he announces the reformation of the Knothole 
                      Freedom Fighters - officially sanctioned to serve in conjunction 
                      with Geoffrey's Secret Service Team to keep the peace. And 
                      a fragile peace it is, as Robotnik and his charges still 
                      lurk about, plotting their revenge against Sonic. As if 
                      that weren't enough, in his quest to fortify his computer 
                      for his latest onslaught, Robotnik finds and launches a 
                      file that will ultimately tie into the upcoming adaptation 
                      of the Sega Dreamcast game. And wait until you see who the 
                      first lieutenant is.</font></p>

                      Inspired by the popular "Sonic Adventure" game for the hot 
                      Sega "Dreamcast" platform! When Nate Morgan uses his telecrate 
                      technology to infiltrate Dr. Robotnik's computer network, 
                      he receives transmissions that send shivers down the Freedom 
                      Fighter's spines: the dastardly Doc has ordered an excavation 
                      somewhere near the mysterious Cat Country - leading them 
                      to believe he may have found the Hidden City of the Ancients! 
                      Nate and The Freedom Fighters are immediately dispatched 
                      to quell the threat - all, that is, except for Amy Rose, 
                      who the others feel is too young. Amy is outraged - Tails 
                      is allowed to go on the mission, and he's the same age as 
                      her! Will that stop her? Heck, no! Amy calls upon the powers 
                      of the Ring of Acorns to make herself older - transforming 
                      herself into her "Dreamcast" counterpart, and depleting 
                      the ring of all its energy in the process! The price is 
                      a harsh one, as the ring has been used in the service of 
                      healing the Queen. Fearing ill effects, Nate insists Amy 
                      comes along on the mission with them. Can they survive Amy's 
                      amazing transformation? For that matter, can Amy?! It's 
                      a journey of discovery that will lead our fearless heroes 
                      to the startling new world depicted in the Sonic Adventure 
                      Dreamcast game! PLUS: The senses-shattering conclusion to 
                      the epic "Tales of the Great War" back-up series by Ken

                      by the wretched Robotnik and his horrid horde of Shadowbots, 
                      after having descended upon the Floating Island. It's all 
                      part of Robotnik's quest to find "Perfect Chaos" - a hibernating 
                      dragon-like monster made of living water. In order to revive 
                      it, Robotnik needs a major power source. Having his evil 
                      eyes set on the Floating Island's "Master Emerald" - he 
                      ends up destroying a portion of the Chaos Chamber and its

                      The mysteries of the Hidden City of The Ancients continue 
                      to obsess the heroes: Are the citizens of this pocket environment

                      Mobius' secret origin? Will Sonic and the others from Knothole

                      mobilize for conflict? Meanwhile, in the Knuckles story: 
                      In pursuit of the evil Dr. Robotnik (who stole shards of 
                      the Master Emerald), Knuckles follows him deep into the 
                      mysterious Cat Country where he finds the Mystic Ruins. 
                      Time is running out as the grounded Floating Island is invaded 
                      by Cat People. And in the backup solo story, Amy Rose gets 
                      used to her new body... and her new powers?</font></p>

                      Continuing the special tie-in tale with Sega's Sonic Adventure 
                      Dreamcast game. Having been accepted as celebrities in the 
                      Hidden City of the Ancients, Sonic plays super-hero and 
                      patrols the streets of Station Square. But can he and his 
                      friends survive the menace that lurks in the night? "A Door 
                      To The Past." As Knuckles explores the Mystic Ruins for 
                      shards of the Master Emerald, his is floored by a mysterious 
                      vision of the past showing another side of the echidna race. 
                      Can Knuckles handle it? "Double-Crossed Circuits." A solo 
                      story featuring E-102 "Gamma" from the Sonic Adventure game 
                      - setting the stage for next month's Sonic Super Special

                      Tails' latest plane is missing, but this one's got a tracking 
                      device - leading Sonic and Tales on a frantic flight to

                      both Robotnik and Knuckles, but a threat they hoped they'd 
                      never have to face again. Back in the city, all seems tranquil 
                      for the Mayor and Sally, but you know that can't last - 
                      and before you know it, Sonic, Tails and Knuckles are back 
                      to try to restore order. What is the mystery that threatens 
                      their very existence? Will a cocky hedgehog, a headstrong 
                      echidna and an eager fox be enough to save civilization?</font></p>

                      affected by radiation, leading Sonic and Bunnie to assist 
                      Arachnis in battle against Kodos as they attempt to make

                      exist free of roboticization? And in the backup story -

Ironically, it all takes place in that mechanized metropolis of Robotropolis, but that's not the most shocking surprise: the bittersweet reunion is made even more so by the loss of one of Knothole's own. Plus: another Knuckles back-up story. The recent exploits and intrigue of Knuckles collide in one combustible story, as Knuckles faces off against Dmitri and the Dark Legion. The fact of literally everyone on Mobius hangs in the balance, not to mention Knuckles' family and friends, helplessly trapped in another zone.
