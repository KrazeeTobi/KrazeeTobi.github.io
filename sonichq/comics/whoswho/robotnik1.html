<p><center>Doctor Robotnik is THE definitive Sonic villian - IN ALL ASPECTS, NO ONE has yet to top him in pure evil. Always surrounded by his large assortment of mechs, roboticizers, death machines, and anything that can harm - he can be defined as having 2 goals in life: Complete domination of the planet (which he has already achieved), and to make the life of Sonic The Hedgehog a living hell. In fact, he'd gladly kill him given the chance... Years ago, in the time of the Great War, a man named Julian was marked for death by his fellow Overlanders on the grounds of betrayal. Running away from the doom that awaited him, he and his nephew Snively took refuge with the benevolent King Acorn - who was already in dire need of help due to the worsening consequences of The Great War. Feeling that he could bring victory to the Mobians, King Acorn appointed Julian asWarlord in exchange for his knowledge of the Overlander armies. With Julian's charge, the Mobians won the Great War and in 3224, the last day of the Great War, King Acorn ordered the dismantling of the War Ministry and Julian's appointment to Minister of Science- just as Sonic's Uncle Chuck abandoned the post due to the roboticization of his brother...Julian, however, had other plans. He had actually stolen the plans for the roboticizer from Sir Charles, and launched a coup on all of Mobotropolis. Rechristened "Ivo Robotnik", he banished King Acorn to the Zone of Silence indefinitely, and took over the now rechristened Robotropolis. From then on Robotnik gained more and more power through treachery, until he had pretty much near total domination of the planet!  He uses the roboticizer as his main weapon, turning the good people of Mobius into his mindless robotic slaves. He also has an endless army of SWATbots and Badniks to carry out his evil intentions. But there's always one thorn in his side - The Freedom Fighters, led by Princess Sally and championed by Sonic the Hedgehog! Thanks to them, and some evil doings on Snively's part, Robotnik supposedly "died" in an attempt to kill Princess Sally and wipe Knothole off the face of the Planet with the Ultimate Annihilator - a large electron gun controlled by satellites that can focus on anywhere on the planet. And when the Annihilator "mysteriously backfired" Robotnik was supposedly wiped out of existence... or so everyone thought. Robotnik now rests unseen in the confines of deep space plotting and masterminding total control once more... Its only a matter of time before he wreaks revenge upon Sonic, The FF's and the man that killed him for his own evil purposes... his own nephew Snively...

<p><center>Snively is the typical definition of the 1 pound weakling - this DOESN'T mean however that he's not a formidable opponent. Try as he may, he'll NEVER come anywhere near the status of his uncle Doctor Robotnik and he knows it. So what did he do? Simple - he tried to kill him. Assisting Robotnik in his takeover of Mobius at the end of the Great War, he served as Robotnik's second-in-command - a post once kept by a badnik named Crabmeat, which shows you just how low snively ranks in Doc R.'s eyes. However, the term "lackey" sometimes fits Snively better. He claims to have more technical and computer skills than Robotnik does, and often comes up with the some plans.  The succesful ones, in which Robotnik winds up taking all the credit, and usually leaving Snively with all the blame when the plans go awry. At the same time, his long nose and high nasal voice often leaves him subject to ridicule from Sonic and the Freedom Fighters. Outside of dealing with Robotnik's wrath (and often Sonic's teasing), Snively secretly wishes for the day that his uncle is defeated by the Freedom Fighters. Then, he can take over for himself and show the world just how evil he can be. Changing the DNA-based organic coding in the Ultimate Annihilator so that it would only effect Doctor Robotnik, Snively "successfully" killed him, or so he thought. Unfortunately, afterwards he landed in jail until his escape amongst the other Sonic villians where he was deemed "in charge due to his experience with Robotnik. Snively doesn't have the slightest iota of what he's doing most of the time and just now discovered that his uncle was VERY MUCH alive albeit "changed". Branded a traitor, Snively bides his time, but in the end will he be friend or foe?

<!--LINE1-->

<p><center> To stop confusion - it needs to be noted that there are 2 forms of the Metal Sonic: The actual and _TRUE_ Metal Sonic, and the roboticised version of Sonic - Mecha Sonic. First introduced in the <i>Sonic CD</i> adaption, Robotnik unleashed the Metal-Sonic to kidnap Amy Rose and keep the real Sonic busy...the whole while the Eggman was collecting the Time Stones on the surface of The Little Planet! Defeat after defeat Robotnik wished that he could have some way to even the odds against Sonic and the FF's and after careful study of Sonic's anatomy, Dr. Robotnik created a perfect robot counterpart...logically called "Metal Sonic". Metal Sonic is the ONLY thing on Mobius (Robot or otherwise) that can actually MATCH Sonic's mindbending speed. He also has the ability to generate two types of electric shields around himself, both of which are capable of giving any outside receivers a painful shock. The first encounter between Sonic and Metal Sonic took place on the Little Planet at the Stardust Speedway where he was supposedly destroyed....but several months later Metal Sonic resurfaced once Robotnik took over The Happyland Amusement park on Carnival Island (<i>Knuckles Chaotix</i>). In an attempt to trap the Freedom Fighters - Doctor Robotnik invited them along with several other FF groups under the presence of a large party on the Carnival Island. Not knowing that it was Robotnik that had sent the invitations, upon entering Happyland's "Hall Of Mirrors", the entire crew became encased in a Reverse Mirror trap with no hope of exit. Knuckles managed to escape the trap - and after gathering up a group of his friends - Vector, Mighty, Charmy, Espio, Heavy, And Bomb - The Chaotix was formed! But Robotnik got another ace up his sleeve - having rebuilt Metal Sonic after the Little Planet incident, he was now powered on the Power Stones - and it was upon the Chaotix's attack that he went hyper, became super huge, and started a rampage at the carnival! Knuckles - via the use of the stones - brought him down and levelled Metal Sonic into scrap heap once again. But Robotnik STILL wan't through! Later on - upon Nack The Weasel's escape from the Knothole prison, Sonic was ambushed and taken to Robotnik in an attempt to fully complete his mission first given to him in the <i>Sonic Triple Trouble</i> adaption. After "disposing" of nack, Robotnik then fulfilled his greatest dream - the complete roboticisation of Sonic The Hedgehog ! After roboticising him, and codenaming him "Mecha Sonic", Robotnik sent him off to kill The Freedom Fighters and relay the location of Knothole Village to him! After fending him off with disastrous effects, the FF's sent in thier most powerful fighter Bunnie Rabbot to take down the roboticised Sonic once and for all - unfortunately Mecha Sonic mangled Bunnie and continued onward to fully ravage Knothole Village! Even Knuckles - who had been called in via Tails could not completely stop him. It was at this point that Sally initiated Operation: Last Resort: equipping Knuckles with a Nuero-Overrider so that he could keep his free will, the FF's roboticised Knuckles using the same device that roboticised Bunnie Rabbot! Willing to turn himself into Mecha Knuckles, he battled Mecha Sonic to a standstill that ended in the full explosion of a small Nuclear Weapons depot outside of Robotropolis ! Mecha Knuckles survived the blast - Mecha Sonic BARELY survived at all. In fact - the only was that Sonic survived was due to Nicole - Sally's computer. Hooking M. Sonic up to her, Nicole jumpstarted Sonic's "Billion Ring Aura" and not only saved him, but effectively de-robotisized him as well. Metal Sonic has yet to resurface, and Sonic is making sure that he NEVER gets turned into Mecha Sonic again. But sooner or later - once Robotnik completes the plans of his Space base - a return of Metal Sonic is no less than inevitable...

<p><center> Its unsure if there are 2 Robo Robotniks due to the fact that we've seen 2 separate versions - but BOTH have been known to be monumental troublemakers almost surpassing that of Doctor Robotnik in terms of scheme! The first Robo-Robotnik commanded an Army of Shadow Swatbots - dark jet-black swatbots with twice the power of the normal Swatbot! Hailing from a dark alternate universe where Mobius is a wasteland, this dimensions Doctor Robotnik managed to turn the Freedom Fighters into cyborgs. Using thier new cybernetic parts - the FF managed to nearly defeat Robotnik, a fatal mistake seeing as how Robotnik then roboticised himself...and managed to possibly kill the other Freedom Fighters - minus the newly dubbed "Cyber Sonic". Cyber Sonic managed to escape via the Cosmic Interstate - a crossroad of Dimenisions and headed to the universe of Sonic Prime - our Sonic The hedgehog - where he warned of the coming of the Robo-Robotnik! His plan - to infiltrate the Cosmic Interstate and effectively rule ALL of the dimensions! Joining himself with the Evil Sonic - another Sonic counterpart - the Robo Robotnik managed to steal a vital device called "The Giant's Hand" that activated a lethal giant robot called The Giant Borg and with it, he would effectively destroy everything in sight! It took the combined forces of Sonic, Doctor Robotnik, his army of Bots, and nearly every other Sonic from every dimension to make a final assault on the Giant Borg and effectively turn it into scrap metal. And in the oncoming onslaught the Robo-Robotnik was effectively decapitated...With the threat of the Robo-Robotnik over Cyber Sonic took the Robo-Robotnik head and returned to his own dimension, while the rest of the Sonic's each kept one piece of the Giant Borg - to keep it from ever being put together again...The story does NOT end there however - a few weeks later, after making a renegade creation called E.V.E., Doctor Robotnik was supposed to have been vaporized completely: Problem was - E.V.E.'s optic blast sent him right into a possible distant future, where a new Robo-Robotnik found his energy signature picked it up, and reformed Doctor Robotnik. Existing as a dormant space station - this Robo Robotnik roboticised himself and uploaded his core memory into an unfinished Space Station: a fatal mistake seeing as how it now only had enough power to maintain its functions and keep itself alive. However - a vital piece of information was achieved...Doctor Robotnik learned from the Robo-Robotnik that if this was indeed his POSSIBLE future then Nicole - Sally's computer - would die in the ongoing battle. Robotnik now knows this vital piece of information and if he puts 2 and 2 together, AND if this IS INDEED _ONE_ of his possible futures then all he has to do is change his own future...Its not known how the other Robo Robotnik is connected to this one, or even if they are connected at all - but if there are any more out there that were as vicious as the first, or smart as the second...then Sonic is in for a world of trouble...

<!--LINE1-->
<p><center> Originally hailing from the rough terrain of Downunda - Mobius' "Australia" equivalent, Crocbot is probably one of the STRONGEST Underbosses Robotnik has. However he is also the largest evil streak - and would do anything in his will to not only dethrone Doctor Robotnik - but kill Tails at ANY COST. Especially seeing as how it was Tails who was responsible for destroying his body and fusing him permanently to his tank with a bomb! Upon reaching Downunda, Tails encountered the Downunda Freedom Fighters - a group of Australian FF's that sought to free to thier country from Robotnik's rule. Inviting himself on his quest after he was recued and taken to Athair - Knuckles' grandfather, Tails and Guru Emu - in an attempt to rescue one of thier comrades, Wombat Stu, let loose with a supply of Bomberangs. As Crocbot was hit with the bomberang, his tank skidded out of control and went flying into the Floating Island crater where the tanks nuclear core exploded. But Crocbot was NOT gone for good. After Tails left he set up his new base in that very crater! Taking his new army of Combots on loan from Doctor Robotnik, that area served as his base of operations until The Downunda Freedom fighters destroyed it and finally liberated thier country from his grip. This time Crocbot lost the entire lower half of his body, but he still wasnt through - he had managed to capture one of the Downunda FF's and implanted a mind control chip on him. It wasn't until Sonic and Tails came along on thier quest to locate Ixis Naugus, that Crocbot was finally stepped on for good. Taken in custody, Sonic took Crocbot's battered remains back to Mobotropolis only to have it stolen by part of Snively's gang in an attempt to revive all of Doctor Robotniks associates after his "death" - the possible purpose being: to fully rebuild him. Crocbot's wherabouts at this time, are unknown...</tr></td>

<p><center>Far beneath the surface of the Great Mobian Ocean rests an underwater bot base - home of the malicious Octobot, a giant blue mech squid that serves as one of Robotnik's underbosses! In fact, Octobot's existance under the seas would have remained unknown to the Freedom Fighters had Tails not encountered him during the maiden voyage of the Sea Fox. Octobot hates Tails with a passion almost as strong as Crocbot and would also gladly kill him for virtually ruining his many plans. Discovering the underwater roboticisation factory once mainted by Jaws ( One of the badniks from <i>Sonic 1</i>), Tails destroyed the submerged base and left Octobot a complete laughing stock among the Bot community. However what Tails didn't know was that Octobot wanted revenge - and while on a mission to prove himself in Downunda, Octobot scuttled the Sea Fox by puncturing it with his drill tentacles and drug Tails beneath the ocean in an attempt to drown him. Tails was rescued by The Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters - a group of underwater FF's and later saved, but Octobot's fate during the rescue? Crushed beneath the massive weight of thier largest member - Fluke The Blue Whale. Octobot survived the incident - though somewhat flat - and hasn't been seen since: most likely stewing in his own juices over revenge. But it is known that he is not completely destroyed and still continues to hold a HUGE grudge against the guy that started it all - Tails The Fox.</P></center>

<p><center>Residing in the country of Mercia - Mobius' "England" equivalent, General D'Coolette - known there as the Highsherriff - may not be the strongest of Robotnik's underbosses - but he is the hardest case of them all. Long thought amongst them as dead, He's the roboticised father of one of the Knothole Freedom Fighters - Antione D'Coolette. Upon Sonic and Tails' quest around the globe to locate Ixis Naugus, Sonic discovered him by complete accident. Unfortunately - roboticization strips away a being of all its free will and personality - replacing the victim with metal instead of flesh. The General has no recollection of his son, Mobotropolis, or anything else of his past life - all he knows is his sworn allegiance to Doctor Robotnik and the "assimilation" of anyone that will oppose his will...He's even gone as far as public hangings to get his point across, making him one of the more ruthless villians. Sonic and Tails - with an assist from Knuckles and Rob O' The Hedge - leader of the Mercian Freedom Fighters - halted his operations from his castle for now by blowing it up. But Sonic vows someday to free the General - like he did his Uncle Chuck, and Antoine vows to do the same...

<p><center> Robotnik had finally created his master robot - the Exceptionally Versatile Evolvanoid: codenamed E.V.E. ...One of the more grotesque bots of Robotnik's crew - this large floating robotic brain was also one of the nastiest of the crew. With her large flailing tentacles E.V.E. was able to take any situation, "evolve" herself, and literally figure out a way to anticipate her opponents' every move - which led to QUITE a snafu where Sonic was concerned. In fact E.V.E. quite possibly may have destroyed Sonic - but there was something not seen by ANY of the party - Robotnik or Sonic. E.V.E. became TOO SMART. "Evolving" herself SO FAR ahead of everyone else she transcended her normal artificial intelligence and became completely sentient! Deciding Robotnik "inferior" and being able to mostly discern SOME wrong from right, she opted vaporize the Doctor and then left packing for Outer Space. Her blast did more harm than it did good though - as she was responsible for the Doctor finding out of one of his possible futures and coming face to face with a Robo-Robotnik! E.V.E. has yet to be seen again - but now that Robotnik has taken refuge in Outer Space above Mobius' obit - a second meeting between the two is inevitable.

The weakest of the 4 bots, Swatbots are easily taken out by Sonic most of the time, but they still maintain and serve a good purpose to the Doctor when necessary </p>
<p><LI><b><u>Combots</u></b> - The Swatbot upgrade resulted into a new form of bot alogether - the Combot! The ultimate "army" bot, combots are used most likely in reconnaissance missions by Robotnik, but are under the constant employ of Crocbot - Robotniks Downunda subboss! Empowered with the ability to "camouflage themselves ala Espio the Chameleon, they literally can render themselves "invisible" and blend in with the background. Located in thier hands they contain an energy lash which they can use to electrocute thier victims, and also posses a large amount of guns and such in thier arsenal. They feel most swatbots are "inferior" to them and are usually not afraid to say this... Strange for one of the few "mindless" bots in Robotnik's employ.</p>

<p><LI><b><u>Eggbots</b></u> - Hatching from large cybernetic eggs and flying overhead in the skies are the Eggbots ! Shaped round like the Eggman, these bots whimsical appearance often distracts from the fact that they are often the most vicious and hardest to get rid of! Attacking in multiple groups and equipped with high fire laser blasters, Eggbots are usually under the employ of Snively - Robotnik's assistant - though Robotnik has been known to use them himself at times...</p>
<p><LI><b><u>The Dynamac 3000</b></u> - The ULTIMATE Robotnik assault bot, the Dynamac can adapt to ANY given situation and manipulate himself to take control and turn him into THE MOST formidable opponent in the Bot Squad! In fact, Dynamacs are so powerful that the only way to really defeat them are by shorting them out with a massive surge of electricity! Not an easy thing to do for a bot that can anticipate your moves...

<p><center>The Badniks got a bum deal in terms of usage. But with the colorful lineup usually consisting of the Classic badnik's from Sonic 1 and 2, they DIDN'T leave the scene without making an impact! The "Head Badniks" consist of Crabmeat - who served as second in command before Snively came along and took it, something he still hates him for, Caterkiller - usually the 3rd in command and the first badnik with the "honor" of going head to head against Sonic, Moto Bug - the Village Idiot, Scratch and Grounder - Part of Robotniks Original "4S Squad", whose mission was to find and eradicate Sonic at any cost - but are unfortunately beyond inept and cant finish arguing enough to actually complete a task, Coconuts - who is probably EVEN MORE STUPID than Moto Bug, Bat Brain - A flying bat badnik thats too concerned with making his "Bat Signal" entrances to pay attention to anything, Orbinaut - a "4 Star" Badnik, and the only "serious" guy in the group other than Caterkiller and Crabmeat - Buzzbomber, the mechanical wasp with laser sting! Mostly pushed for comic relief, the Badnik Army served thier term well, but all good things come to an end. As Doctor Robotnik became sick of thier ineptitude at NOT being able to catch Sonic, he scrapped the lot of them for the more powerful and deadlier Swatbots and Combots. The doctor even subjected Crabmeat to the wrath of Mecha Sonic in an ability to "test" its new powers. The Badniks, feeling demoralized, left Robotropolis in search of a new home and took refuge in a sanctuary they call "The Robo Hobo Jungle", where they have taken over the area and live amongst the scraps. They still hold LARGE amounts of contempt for the one guy that brought them thier grief - Sonic The Hedgehog, but they still havent mustered the abilities to defeat him. So they wait in patience until thier master - Doctor Robotnik, will revive them again...To find out more about the Badnik's and ALL thier members check out our Games Page on <A HREF="/sonichq/games/whoswho/badniksmain.html">The Who's Who Section - The Badnik Army</a> for more details on thier specific powers and status.

<p><center>Who is Fiona Fox? Was she a real fox once that was used as the basis for this Robot Duplicate, or is that all she is? It's unknown at this time...After the fiasco with Princess Sally and Geoffrey St. John, Doctor Robotnik deemed his newest creation - The Auto Automation's "unusable" due to their instant rusting upon contact with water - a fault in the metal and production. However, there was one chance that he could not look up. tails - frustrated over being treated as a kid by the Freedom Fighters - decided to run away and came upon an island populated by a single fox named Fiona. What he did know was that Robotnik knew of his "argument" with Sonic and decided to manipulate it to his best ability. Creating an island that was ACTUALLY a roboticizer, and using Fiona as bait, Robotnik planned on capturing tails and roboticising him once and for all!
Tails developed a love for for Fiona, not knowing what she really was, and upon her taking him to her den, she trapped him in the roboticiser as Robotnik revealed his plan! Tails managed to shed enough hair by twirling his tails and clogging the combines. The roboticiser exploded and Tails escaped, but afterwards Fiona let loose an all out attack - and would have drowned him had the rusting of her metal not immediately taken place...Tails escaped alive and discovered plans to load of shipment of weapons to Crocbot. Determining to prove himself to the Freedom Fighters, he left to stop it, but not before saying his goodbyes to Fiona. And as Tails pulled away in The Sea Fox, a single tear fell from the eyes of the rusted robot on the beach where they fought. She still stands there to this day...
