<!--LINE1-->
<p><center>Raised in New Mobotropolis before Robotnik's coup, Sonic was an average growing boy - exception being his abnormally insane speed which he worked on improving everyday. Sonic lost his parents to the roboticizer in The Great War, and was taken in by his Uncle Chuck, whom he lived with in Knothole, until he too fell prey to the roboticizer sometime around Robotnik's planetary coup. Helpless to stop any of the going ons as Robotnik took control of the populace, roboticized most of the Mobians, and took over the planet, Sonic and a few other children, including the Princess Sally, were herded to Knothole Villiage where they could learn, grow, and adapt to situations and eventually become a freedom fighting force that could one day defeat Robotnik and free Mobius! As Sonic developed his incredible speed, his attitude became legendary. Sonic is irreverent, confident, impatient and constantly bursting at the quills with energy. Above all, he's the bravest big-hearted hedgehog anywhere. It all comes down to loyalty, an important quality that this hedgehog is full of... among other things. All Sonic really wants is for life to return to the way it was before Dr. Robotnik took over, before polluting the planet and roboticizing everyone. And Sonic will stop at nothing to make his wish into reality.  When Sonic collects seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Sonic. As Super Sonic, all of his natural abilities are enhanced! His speed is so incredible that he actually hovers a few feet above the ground rather than running on it. He is completely invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning). His color also changes from brilliant blue to shining yellow. However, he needs atleast fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back to normal Sonic. The next stage in his transformation is Ultra Sonic - which can only be attained if he absorbs HUGE amounts of chaos energy almost turning Sonic into a living Chaos battery - literally trailing stars behind him and flashing with an atomlike glow. The final step is Solar Sonic - In this phase Sonic can adapt to any climate and his body litteraly adjusts itself to the geographical surroundings, giving him an assortment of all kinds of various powers depending on the Chaos Energy in his system and the location and area. In cold areas - Polar Sonic, in tropical areas Eco-Sonic, etc. And in normal areas, he resumes normal Ultra Sonic status with an advanced Super Sonic like form and a mix of powers.</P></center>

<p><center>Not much is known of Tails' background. Tails seemed to have been abondened after his parents were roboticized as a little kid, but Sonic found him and brought him into their family of Freedom Fighters when he was near 5 years old. Since then, he has grown older, now being able to go on many missions with the main group. His two tails has been of invaluable assistance to the Freedom Fighters as well. He often refers to Sally as Aunt Sally and thinks of Sonic as his big brother as well as a sort of father. Tails view Sonic as the only hero in the universe, and will always try to be exactly like him. Tails also is the Chosen One, as destined by the Ancient Walkers, to be the greatest hero of his time. Tails is outgoing and is the kind of person who can make a friend out of anybody, except maybe Doc Robotnik! He's also committed to his cause and gets very determined to do his job when he takes part in missions, resulting in an extreme bravery. When Tails collects seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Turbo Tails. As Turbo Tails, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is also invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning), and glows a bright orange-yellow color. Four Super Flicky birds come to his aid, destroying every Badnik in sight and clearing a path for him. However, he needs atleast fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back to normal Tails. The next phase in tails' transformation is Hyper Tails, which can only be attained of he absorbs HUGE AMOUNTS of Chaos Energy ! In this form Tails is aided by 4 Chaos enhanced Flicky birds that come to his aid and literally destroy and attack anything he wishes!

<p><center>Sally was raised in the pressures and responsibilities of royalty all her life. Not knowing much of her mother, she got used to living with her father the King, until Robotnik took over. He devastated everything and then her father mysteriously disappeared... Since then, Sally lived in Knothole Village as the the leader of the Freedom Fighters, determined to defeat Robotnik and win back her rightful heritage as ruler of the soon to be free Mobius. Heroic, intelligent, and very wise in modern situations as well as war tactics, She's more than your normal princess as she studied immensely under the tutelage of her royal teacher, Julayla after the King vanished. She is serious about her work and is committed to her cause. While she can be annoyed by Sonic's attitude, deep down inside, she knows that somewhere she loves Sonic and he loves her. BUT Neither of them will ever admit it though unless something really forces them to (or SEGA allows it >;o) ). Currently her father has been found and the person she once found herself fighting for - she has become more distant from....With the King either lying to her "for the good of the kingdom" or doing things such as trying to disband the FF's, giving the throne aimlessly to her brother Prince Elias, or keep her from seeing Sonic, the only reason Sally has yet to say anything mean is out of respect for him. A respect that she is slowly losing...

<p><center>Prince Elias' background comes from the far-off Floating Island. Way back before Robotnik's coup - during the Great War with the human like Overlanders, while Sonic, Sally, and the others were herded off to Knothole - Queen Alicia and a toddler boy named Elias were carted off to a safehaven on the Floating Island. However - en route, they were attacked and King Acorn feared his wife and first son dead. He never told Sally so that "he would spare her", and possibly himself, the grief of losing someone she had never known. What was not known was that the convoy ships DID make it, but JUST BARELY as most of the crew died, barring Queen Alicia who fell into a near 10 year coma, Prince Elias - who remained unscathed, and one of the colonels under Geoffry St. John's father - who also passed. Discovered by the Guardians of the Floating Island during that time, they took in the Prince and raised him, set up somewhere for the colonel and the prince to later live, and made sure to keep the Queen in stasis until she could someday be revived. Prince Elias thought his father died in the Robotnik takeover, King Acorn thought his son died in the Great war, and Sally - who was a child at the time - knew where NEITHER of them were. Ten years later - King Acorn finds word that that the queen may still be alive and after sending The Secret Service to the Floating Isle, the come upon not only The Brotherhood Of Guardians but Prince Elias and the comatose Queen Acorn as well! Now the Prince has returned - and being the firstborn male, he has also gained claim to the throne. The thing is - Does he really want it? Prince Elias is unsure of his role in a new world, with his newfound family. BUT he has seemed to gain a small sense of reliability with Sonic, and has tended to avoid Sally for right now, seeing as how shecurrently has issues with King Acorn. Only time will tell however, just how Elias will affect the kingdom AND The Freedom Fighters in the future...

<p><center>She's the bubbliest member of the Freedom Fighters, always on the go, and Amy Rose's background is about as mysterious and not known to anybody except possibly herself. Rumor has it that her past somehow has dealings with the magical Little Planet that appears above Never Lake once every year... Amy Rose's origins lie in the country of Mercia, an Olde England like province of the Acorn Kingdom across the sea. There she lived for a while with her cousin, Rob O' The Hedge - leader of the Mercian branch of Freedom Fighters. When Robotnik took over, he made it his business to create several underbosses - the Mercian one being none other than Antoine's (another FF member) father - General D'Coolette! As things went from bad to worse, Rob sent Amy away to live in Knothole where she would hopefully be much safer. Since then Amy adapted to life and came to fall head over heels for the local hero - Sonic - where she assumed the position of his #1 fan and is ALWAYS on his heels! Sonic milks the adoration for all its worth but Tails is more or less indifferent to the whole thing - though he'll occasionally tag along with Amy from time to time on an adventure. As far as Sally's relationship with Sonic goes - Amy isn't all that hot about it at all really, but she stays clear due to respect of thier relationship. If only she was a little older...Amy's biggest adventure came when Doc Robotnik discovered her and kidnapped her during his first unveiling of the Metal Sonic fiasco! Sonic rescued her and Amy popped up now and then - but with her being a little older now, Amy is now officially a full time member of the Freedom Fighters and follows off heartily on their adventures always ready to contribute a hand !

<p><center>Bunnie Rabbot with her cute "lil' ol', accent" and sugar-sweet disposition, is not only the strongest of all The Freedom Fighters - but she's the heart of the group as well. Since being taught some martial arts moves from Princess Sally herself, Bunnie's been able to flatten a door with one kick, split a boulder with a judo chop and "just plain ol' pound some Swatbot be-hind." Bunnie still maintains her perky personality despite squeaking and clanking if her joints aren't regularly oiled...Bunnie's family comes from the Southern part of Mobius. Always optimistic she always lends a smile and will always try to cheer up the group when their spirits are down... She hates Robotnik with a heated vengeance for what he did to her though and would gladly kill him if she got the chance. Armed with a portable roboticizer, Swatbots captured and roboticized many southern Mobians, including Bunnie's parents. Bunnie escaped but was followed and later captured herself. It was there that she was rescued by Sonic and Rotor as the roboticisation process was halfway done. This has left Bunnie with her left arm and both legs roboticized and the rest of her body normal. She has gone through much emotional pain, yet she has matured into a loyal Freedom Fighter with exceptional strength and determination. Bunnie is DEEPLY in love with another Freedom Fighter - Antoine D'Coolette - and thier love for each other is probably the strongest out of all of the Sonic couples put together...</P></center>

He is good at fencing, cleaning, and cooking and he's now getting braver, too - so Ant's been coming up in the world! At one time Sonic and Antione would NEVER get along - either always at each others throats or Antione always being the butt of Sonics jokes - Antoine had it bad. But they soon came to bury the hatchet - namely due to a certain obnoxious skunk named Geoffrey St. John that they both LOATHE equally...Antoine D'Coolette's family is from the French section of Mobius but came to live in the Kingdom of Acorn where his father became General of the armed forces. There they remained in King Acorn's realm until he was sacked by Robotnik's mechanical forces during the coup. Once thinking his father dead, Antoine wears one of his old uniforms and carries his broadsword in memory...Antoine's mission in life is to follow in his father's footsteps, little does he know that his father serves as a mindless roboticized Robotnik Underboss in the kingdom of Mercia! Ant sees himself as the one who will restore the realm for the Princess through his honor and courage. Others see Antoine as a sometimes cowardly-acting klutz. And sometimes...they are both right.

<p><center>Everyone else on the team certainly represents something. So what does Rotor represent? Not only is he the brains of the group, but he's the glue that holds them together as well! A walrus inventor with high technical skills, Rotor is the only member of the Freedom Fighters who can fight Robotnik's technology WITH technology. Not being much of a socialite, like Sonic, Rotor keeps to what he knows: building anything he wants and fixing anything he can. Though he can program them, the one thing he can't fix are computers - they tend to backfire grossly on him most of the time. Because he is a fast-learner, he continuously takes things apart to learn how to put it back together. Sonic thinks of him as slow as a lava flow, but underwater -- zoom-- like a torpedo! As a valued member of the Freedom Fighters, Rotor has exceptional skills in mechanics and electronics. He has a very fast mind and can fix complex mechanical problems with ease. He's now a member of the newly appointed city council. Having grown up next door to Sonic, the both of them being best friends, they escaped together to the palace when Robotnik took over - unfortunately, he was also separated from his parents as well. His mom escaped with his little brother (a baby at the time) to the arctic. Rotor's father and older brother (who he hasn't seen since), was captured and supposedly roboticized. Rotor misses his family a lot and is waiting until Robotnik's defeat so he can find them and they can be a family again. He won't speak out often when he disagrees with something due to his shyness, but you can tell that the loss of his family has hit him hard...

Always eager to help, she often flies the Freedom Fighters all around Mobius whenever they need her and was an INTEGRAL part of freeing Sonic's name during the "death" of Princess Sally! Dulcy is a protector dragon, meaning she can breathe fire, and blow freezing ice, as well as the ability to sense truth in others. Also Dulcy is capable of terrific speeds when flying by snapping her tail in back of her, in a move known as "cracking the whip". Dulcy longs one day to roam the skies and be free once more, but as long as Robotnik reigns she can't do that in peace. So she forever looks towards a brighter future...

<p><center>A near sentient thinking, talking handheld computer Nicole is possibly the most special Freedom Fighter on the whole team. Why? She's from the future. She is a gift to the present Princess Sally from Princess Sally's future version! It is that that in the decisive battle with Doctor Robotnik, Nicole will be destroyed. Nicole was in fact created by the future version of Rotor years after those events happened. Commanded by King Sonic and Queen Sally, Nicole was sent into the past as a gift to help the Princess. But Nicole is more than a computer she is also a valued friend to all the Freedom Fighters as she is always there for Sally to talk to personally and has even saved Sonic from the grips of death and permanent roboticisation. Always full of info she is also a bit of a jokester as she occasionally likes to give Sonic a jolt of electricity when he uses her. As Sally put it "She is a gift to myself, from myself...A friend when I needed one the most" and without her they may never be able to see the day when Robotnik will be defeated or to fully appreciate Julaylas last words upon her death - "To thine own self be true".

<!--LINE1-->

<p><center>King Acorn has led a life of tough decisions and harsh realities. It began around the Great War when he thought he lost his wife after an Overlander attack on the kingdom. After that came the Great Robotnik coup that would change his life forever as he ended up being banished to The Zone Of Silence for 10 years by Warlord Julian A.K.A. Doctor Ivo Robotnik !!! While there he also met with another old foe to the kingdom - Ixis Naugus, the once royal wizard (now completely mad) and creator of the zone Acorn had to spend his next ten years in! The effects of The Zone Of Silence are known to drive those in it to madness and the only way King Acorn could survive was by pledging fealty - and his kingdom - to Naugus with little or no hope of stopping Robotnik or ever escaping....Over time somewhere along the line the king lost total memory, and when Sonic and Sally came to rescue him they had no idea of what thier effects could cause. Prolonged exposure to the Zone Of Silence also brought along rapid crystallization to the body - Full crystallization meant instant death. Sonic, Sally, and Rotor managed to stop the process in time but for quite a while the king lay in a coma until Sonic probed his mind courtesy of Doctor Quack's Dream Watcher. The king is now fully uncrystallized thanks to the help of the magical Crown and Sword Of Acorns, but he has yet to realise that he is slowly distancing himself from the one person who fought so hard to save him - his daughter Sally. He's gone as far as disbanding the FF's and replacing them with the Secret Service, barring Sally from a relationship with Sonic, and giving the throne to Elias instead of Sally. Needless to say - The FF's don't agree with a lot of the decisions made. And who could blame them?

<!--LINE1-->
<p><center>In a place where Overlanders are at times hated and feared, Nate is the brightest exception. A small black male with a large glowing heart - Nate is the first person to have set the world of Mobius on its collective ear; him being one of the first people to learn how to master the art of Ring Forging...It all started back in Overland City, home of the Overlanders. After creating the Ring forge,his assistant Julian Kintobor - better known later as Doctor Robotnik - sabotaged the Forge resulting in a massive explosion that destroyed a part of the city. No lives were lost, but Nate - being the head of the Geo-Physicians department of the Overlanders was brought in for trial and subsequently sentenced to banishment from the city. Possibly knowing of Kintobor's treachery - Nate took the Ring Forge and began his lifelong banishment. After crossing the Mobian Badlands tired, without food, and nearing death he had finally managed to reach the Great forest where he passed out after encountering a troop by King Frederic - Sally's grandfather. Barring complaints from those such as Ixis Naugus and Warlord Kodos about having a human in thier midst, Frederic commanded that Nate be nursed back to health and in return for thier services, Nate asked to use his Ring forge technology and one of the King's Chaos Emeralds to help the medieval society of Mobotropolis. The outcome of this partnership? The birth of the city of New Mobotroplis, the declaration of the Power Ring as the 5th element of Mobius due to its innate properties, the ushering in of the Mobian golden Age - and a new life for Nate. From there Nate became official advisor to the king and best friend to King Max as he first ascended the throne, and a teacher to the kingdom - even teaching Sonic's father and his greatest student: Sonic's Uncle Chuck, the art of forging Power Rings that he had held a secret for so long. But his happiness was not to last. Technology was replacing the ways of magic and sorcery - and this meant that Ixis Naugus - the royal wizard was now losing his edge on the Kingdom...Enlisting the aid of Warlord Kodos, already consumed with hate for the human, they set about a plan to frame Nate. While Nate and a group of students were out and escorted by Kodos and his troops, Naugus went about manipilating a troop of Overlanders in the Great Forest. And when both sides met, Naugus had used his magics to make the both sides turn it into a mini battle. Many of either side were either killed or hurt and when Kodos awoke in the hospital - both he and Naugus went on and on about how none of this would have happened had the king not entrusted the help of a human. It soon led to another trial in which Nate was acquitted, but Naugus had succeeded in his plan and the seeds of Anti Human sentiment had already begun to grow. Not wanting a repeat of what had happened in Overland City - Nate left Mobotropolis again to continue elsewhere. Dropping his Ring Forge in the _then undiscovered_ Knothole Village "Lake Of Rings", Nate migrated to the southern tundra where he befriended a yeti that was almost dying. Healing the hurt beast and naming him "Eddy", they lived out thier days in exile in a castle atop a cliff. It wasnt until YEARS LATER that Sonic and Tails discovered them. On the trail of Ixis Naugus, now a fugitive to the kingdom, they learned his story and asked him to return with them to help make a difference in a city that was still dealing with the pain of Robotnik's takeover. With Nates help and his HUGE Power ring cache, Ultra Sonic and Hyper Tails managed to seal Ixis Naugus - also enhanced by the rings back into the prisonlike Zone Of Silence. But it was at the consequence of one life - Nate's lifelong friend Eddy died in the battle. Sonic, Nate, and Tails returned to the kingdom and Nate - who came face to face with King Acorn after all those years, learned just what happened to his old assistant: Julian Kintobor, now Ivo Robotnik who had come along from his own banishment just as Nate had left the kingdom. Nate vowed to resume his post as advisor to the King and vows to help him and the FF's in thier times of need. And even though there are still those that show racist Anti-Human actions in the city: due to Robotnik's actions, Nate vows to prove someday that not all humans are bad.</P></center>

<p><center>Chuck has had a hard life. He and his brother Jules were once two of the greatest heroes to the kingdom - Jules being the brawn, and Charles being the brains they were practically unstoppable! That is - Until Robotnik came along...Charles was the Royal Engineer for the King and was given his title when he created the Roboticizer, a machine built to roboticize people's limbs lost in wars, accidents, and other tragedies. However, Warlord Julian ( Ivo Robotnik ) sabotaged the machine and made it so that it completely took away a person's will and roboticized them from head to toe. Charles didn't know of this deception, and when Jules was injured in the great war QUITE badly - Chuck roboticised him, and Jules was never the same man again. Stripped of his free will, he became a robotic vegetable - and the first in Robotniks army that would come along later...Chuck blamed himself heavily and quit his job, opened up a chili dog chain raising his orphaned nephew Sonic - Jules' son - until Robotnik fully took over. Charles was later captured and roboticized in the Robotnik coup, and turned into a robot devoid of control just like Jules. However, thanks to Sonic, a power ring, and Charles own determimation, he broke control of his body away from Robotnik and served a spy for the Freedom Fighters. In the defeat of Doc Robotnik, Charles finally felt at peace with himself after helping clear Sonics name of murder in the supposed death of Princess Sally. He still blames himself for the roboticiser but he's not as harsh as he used to be. But his story still does not end - To keep Robotnik from finding them, after Chuck regained his memory, his next step was to hide away Sonic's parents so Robotnik couldn't immediately dismantle them. When Sonic found out about this - once thinking his parents dead - he bacame extremely angry, but over time it ended up bringing the two closer together....Charles is nice to everybody and tries not to let anybody down. He belives the whole roboticizer ordeal is all his fault, but the Freedom Fighters help him to see otherwise. Overall, he's the Freedom Fighters "true father figure", and together with his roboticized dog, Muttski - they head the Robian colony that now occupies Knothole Village...

<p><center>He may be extremely loyal to the kingdom but point blank Geoffrey is a big, fat jerk. More of a jerk than Antoine ever WAS! He's tried to steal Sally away from Sonic numerous times and each time has failed. Always referring to the Freedom Fighters as "Sally's Trainees" or "Rank Amateurs" he "tags along" on trips occasionally just in case the FF's need his "expertise". Unfortunately the guy is actually good at what he does - now currently head of King Acorn's secret service. He's managed to tick off every FF from Sonic by accusing him of murder, to Antoine by accusing his father of being a traitor to the kingdom, and even to Knuckles by giving orders on his island! But the one person he shares a personal loathing for is Sonic the Hedgehog as neither of them can be around each other for less than 2 seconds without fighting like mad weasels! He resents this to all end and  wishes one day he could have him out of his hair permanently to get what he wants - Sally Acorn - but due to the fact that he IS a good guy: which is doubtful - He'd never resort to those measures. Geoff also has a deep resentment for humans - it was humans who killed his father. So naturally he has VERY low thoughts of Nate Morgan - the new human on the block... And in the words of Sonic "He doesn't love anyone, but only loves himself"...</P></center>

<p><center><b> Led by thier commander in chief, Geoffrey St. John - thier true purpose in King Acorn's eyes? Replacements of the Freedom Fighters, Something that didn't bode over well with the core group. According to King Acorn, "children - specifically the Princess, should not be entrusted to the safety and well being of the kingdom". Geoffrey - thier leader, went on command from King Acorn to retrieve the best and brightest around Mobius to act as the group to uphold the kingdoms laws and investigate anything worth interest. the team consists of:
<p></p>
</center>
<blockquote>
<LI><u>Hershey The Cat</u></b> - A skilled fighter, a former Knothole Freedom Fighter, and it gives her a way to pay back her debt after being duped into almost killing Sally. Hershey is the team tactitian and fighter. 
<LI><b><u>Heavy And Bomb</u></b> - The two robot members of The Chaotix. Heavy's ability to interface with anything technological and Bomb's ability to repeatedly blow up. This gives the two a chance to do what they've wanted for so long - namely make up for thier servitude under Doctor Robotnik.
<LI><b><u>Valdez the Chameleon</b></u> - A friend of Espio the Chameleon of the Chaotix, who has a past known only to himself and Geoffrey, Valdez seves as the espionage expert
<LI><b><u>Wombat Stu</b></u> - The youngest of the group, A member of the Downunda Freedom Fighters who is blessed with super hearing and is also quick and agile due to his small size 
<LI><b><u>Geoffrey St. John</b></u> - The leader and overall jerk of the group, who is STRONGLY dedicated to serving his kingdom.

</blockquote>
<p><center>And while they were poised as a way to initially replace the Freedom Fighters, that is NOT always the case as Sonic has seemingly stowed away on missions as well - mostly resulting in a mad King Acorn. One example being the mission to track down Snively, The Fearsome Four, Drago, Warlord Kodos, Arachnis, and Nack The Weasel which resulted in geoffrey getting told off by Elias and Sonic "catching the badguys". And while the others didnt mind Sonic's company at all - it annoys Geoffrey to no end. And Sonic wouldn't have it any other way !
