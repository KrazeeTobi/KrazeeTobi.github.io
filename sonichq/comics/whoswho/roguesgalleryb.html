<p><center> Mammoth Mogul was born eons ago a simple wooly mammoth that lived in the natural order of things, but his whole life changed when he came upon an unknown meteorite-like jewel that fell from the sky, embedded itself into its chest and granted him limitless power. He became master of all he surveyed, but was eventually dethroned by the other races of the planet. During the time afterwards, he discovered that the jewel he found was the most potent form of energy in the universe - the Chaos Emerald! With it he had evolved faster than any other animal on the planet and he was ready again after centuries of dormancy, to take his former position as Mobius' ruler. With Robotnik out of the way thanks to Snively and The Ultimate Annihilator, Mogul sought to take the Floating Island's Chaos Emerald, but failed realising the direct approach wouldn't work. Next he schemed to obtain the mystical Sword of Acorns - King Acorn's magical talisman that serves as an enery conduit capable of draining the powers out of anyone - or anything!...In his quest for power, it took the Chaotix and the Freedom Fighters combined to fully defeat him, but what they didn't realise is that in the end Mogul STILL had the sword and Sonic and Knuckles were left with the fake! With step one out of the way, his next appearance peaked as he drained EVERY DROP Enerjak's Chaos Emerald Power using the Sword of Acorns. Reducing Enerjak to aged dust, Mogul became super and reverted into "Master Mogul"! And infused with the power of 12 Chaos Emeralds with all but the Floating Islands emeralds left he went completely mad with power! After battling Super Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Turbo Tails, The Freedom Fighters, The Chaotix, General Stryker, and even with Athair and The Ancient Walkers stepping in, Mogul succeeded in getting into the Island's Chaos Chamber but had absorbed TOO MUCH POWER and thanks to Locke and Sabre - Knuckles' father and grandfather - he finally ended up encased forever in the newly dubbed "Master Emerald" - which consisted of a 14 level Choas Emerald with Mogul's life essence trapped dormant in its core! Sonic and Knuckles' greatest enemy is currently the ONLY THING keeping the Island afloat, and Knuckles must guard it and make sure Mogul never escapes at any cost...  </tr></td>

<!--LINE1-->

<p><center>Dimitri is the DEFINITIVE Knuckles villain, serving as the "Doctor Robotnik" of the Knuckles universe! While he is by no means anywhere near as nasty as Robotnik he can certainly run a close second! Serving as the Grandmaster, founder, and current leader of the Dark Legion, Enerjak (as he is also known) will do NOTHING to enforce his will of Technology above all upon the populace of the Floating Isle. However - from his perspective, he sees the Brotherhood Of Guardians as the natural enemies and hypocrites that they are. Dimitri began by trying to lift the Floating Island from the face of Downunda with the coming of the Great White comet that threatened to destroy the area. He and his brother Edmund - founder of the Guardians - created the Chaos Syphon responsible for keeping the Island afloat by recycling Chaos energy, but instead it backfired infusing Dimitri with the emerald energy instead! Dimitri went positively insane with the power of 11 Chaos Emeralds howling inside him! He remained buried in an avalanche under Mount Fate for centuries until he was revived. There he rebuilt his "master city" of Nekronopolis - Echidnaopolis remade - until Knuckles And The Chaotix shot him into deep space! Thanks to Mammoth Mogul, Enerjak returned where he resumed leadership of the Legion from Kragok, his own grandson several generations removed. Enerjak didn't realise that he was a pawn in Moguls scheme and after all those centuries of Chaos energy he could do nothing as every drop of it was drained out of him, reducing him to his true age - that of a shriveled old echidna that could barely breathe. Seeking to keep him alive, the DL somehow managed to infuse his aged body with cybernetic parts almost completely roboticizing him to some effect, and leaving VERY FEW bare spots visible! Hence came the cyborg we know today....Dimitri has an infatuation and extreme hatred for Knuckles. Knux is different from the other guardians in mind, body, and spirit - and Dimitri wants to know why...even if it means cutting his great-grandnephew open on an operating table to find out...

<!--LINE1-->
<p><center>Enerjak may be the definitive Knuckles villian, but Kragok is a DEFINITE fan favorite! Just as evil as his Great Grandfather Enerjak, Kragok - the son of Moritori Rex - is somewhere around the same age as Knuckles, perhaps a little older. An insane rival of Knuckles he's akin to looking at Knuckles in a mirror. Whereas Knux is the youngest prodigy of the Guardians, Kragok is the youngest prodigy of the Dark Legion grandmasters! Whereas Knuckles wishes to preserve life, Kragok doesn't care less about it.Complete with a cybernetic claw that can shoot bolts of energy out of it, Kragok would gladly kill if he got the chance. However, he also has noticed that Knuckles has had his eye on Julie-Su for a while. And with Julie once having been the Dark Legion's biggest operative it doesn't take a lot to know that Kragok finds this extremely hateful... All he needs to do is catch Knux off guard once, and then he shall have his complete revenge...Kragok hates knuckles with a heated passion and if you get the two in a room together they'll beat each other silly for hours and probably never stop. For now, Kragok is indefinitely trapped in the Twilight Zone - the Dark Legion's old prison - along with tobor, one of the lost guardians. It's unknown if Kragok OR Tobor survived the fight...

<p><center>Hundreds of years ago, back before the citizens of Echidnaopolis renounced technology there were rumors of a hooded clan that walked the streets and skulked in the shadows. They came to be known as Dark Legionnaires, and led by Menniker - the son of Enerjak, they came to be known as the infamous Dark Legion - that would terrorize the Floating Island indefinitely...that was - until they were banished to a prison-like area called the Twilight Zone by Steppenwolf - Mennikers cousin. Responsible for the death of the very first guardian, Edmund, the Dark Legion has hosted a centuries long 
visage of evil under the auspices of their benefactor Enerjak. They seek to bring back technology to an extreme rivaled almost by that of Robotnik himself. The ritual for induction is to replace a body part or certain area of your body with cybernetic pieces. With thier hoods over thier faces all you can see are thier yellow eyes and red shadows. They are like the "foot soldiers" of Enerjak except these are living people - making them an even deadlier threat...

<p><center> Maybe the Brotherhood Of Guardians are just stupid or they lack common sense - because for the longest time Moritori Rex served as Tobor in the Brotherhood! In an attempt to outwit them once and for all it was Rex - Kragok's father - that had discovered a way to finally escape the Twilight Zone that Steppenwolf had trapped The Dark Legion in years ago! Hawking - another guardian - had left the Echidnaopolis Zone and thus decided on that day to let Tobor take charge for once. Bad Move! Tobor now at the coming of age to become Guardian, had no idea WHO the Dark Legion even was when they escaped into Echidnaopolis' hidden pocket zone! Thus began a miniature war for full control of Echidnaopolis with a neophyte guardian at the helm of his FIRST DAY in training! And as a last minute trap, Rex activated the device that sent both him and Tobor OUTSIDE the barriers of the Echidnaopolis Zone! Ending up in the old site of Echidnaopolis - the Marble Garden Zone - he had planned to kill the neophyte guardian once and for all! But what he didn't plan on were the notorious Marble Garden Earthquakes, and as Tobor and Rex were fighting, the entire corridor collapsed on top of both. Hawking came by to investigate, but only found Rex's body - and because Rex and Tobor looked so much alike and Rex was banged up so badly - Hawking took Rex back INSTEAD of Tobor! Tobor had lived, but it wasn't until hours later that he crawled out bloody with no hope of getting back into the locked out Echidnaopolis Zone. Feeling shamed and not being able to face Hawking, Tobor roamed the surface of Mobius in search of help for his wounds years later...Rex went on to take Tobor's place holding down the fort and plotting for the next legion takeover. And thanks to the fact that the Twilight Zone slows down age - it was he that opened the portal which allowed Kragok and the Legion to escape. Rex was discovered by Knux, after he found out about the REAL Tobor - but by then the damage had been done and the Dark Legion knew all about Haven....

<p><center> Believe it or not, the Dark Legion aren't the ONLY enemies of Knuckles. Years before the incidents with Moritori Rex the inhibitants of Dingo City - a warlike city of dingoes - waged constant war with echidnaopolis! In fact - the war seemed to never stop, and between the Dark Legion and the Dingoes, the guardians had no rest AT ALL! Hence came the time when the dingoes upped the ante - Nuclear War! Stealing a trio of nuclear missiles from the Echidnaopolis Grand Conservatory, the Dingoes launched the missiles squarely at the heart of Echidnaopolis! What they didn't realise was that the 3 nuclear missiles would literally decimate the ENTIRE Floating Island - not just Echidnaopolis. Thus it was up to Hawking, who had used a device he created in advance called the Hyper Zone projector! Creating 2 separate pocket Zones - The Echidnaopolis Zone and The Dingo City Zone were created. Transposing both cities into the zone, Echidnaopolis and Dingo City were lost forever while the Floating Island fell to the death of a century, barren due to a nuclear holocaust. It wasn't until centuries later that Doctor Robotnik's detonation of the Ultimate Annihilator, that the omega wave produced by it broke down the buffers between zones. The only problem was both Echidnaopolis and Dingo City were effectively fighting for space - and it was either destroy one city to let the other get the space or let both cities destroy each other! Hence came the current leader of the Dingo Armed Focres - General Von Stryker! Leading a military of warlike dingoes aling with his assistant "Snively-like" assistant Gerbil, Gerneral Stryker has a deep rooted prejudice for ALL the Echidnas. Needless to say - Dingo City was destroyed and both the Echidnas and Dingos are living VERY TENSELY in Echidnaopolis, with only Knuckles, The Chaotix, and the EST to keep the two city 
inhabitants from beating each other silly. General Stryker has helped out on occasion, but he's been doing some mystery dealings on the side. Slowly plotting to restart what was begun years ago by his forefathers. For now General Stryker is playing "the nice guy", something he can't tolerate for too much longer, but it will only be a matter of time before he makes his ultimate decision on the dingo plight...</table>

<p><center> And you thought Nack The Weasel was a sleaze? This guy is single handedly responsible for the death of Charmy's best friend Mello Bee, the near death of Charmy Bee, laying the entire Chaotix up in the hospital, and passing drugs off to little children masqueraded as Chili Dog sauce. Ebony Hare is the grade A, #1 bottom of the barrel nasty of the Knuxverse. A local mob boss, drug peddler and thug - Ebony Hare passed off LSD to children at the reopening of the Happyland Amusement park. His purpose of doing so? To bring up more proifit margins for his racket. And with Renfield  T. Rodent - proprietor of Happyland - there to take the fall, nothing could be traced back to him. With his thug Blackjack, Ebony has claims to the Echidnaopolis Underworld. The Chaotix took him down after thier metabolism sped up in the hospital but after the near death of Charmy, Ebony has several huge vendettas against him already. Unfortunately it's not known just how deep his connections in Echidnaopolis go. So a rematch is inevitable...

<p><center> This guy is another King Sleaze, but he's basically a villian without a backbone. Claiming to have "reformed", Renfields first jaunt was way back when Doctor Robotnik infiltrated the Floating Isle. Sending out invitations to the various Freedom Fighter groups across Mobius for a party of sorts, Renfield set the stage for a trap to occur in Robotnik's ranks! But when all the FF groups were kidnapped and dissapeared it seemed that Robotnik had finally won - that is UNTIL Knux and The Chaotix came along....They managed to beat Renfield, Robotnik, and Metal Sonic and as a recourse Renfield was arrested by the proper authorities. However - after being set up by Ebony Hare upon happylands re-opening Renfield became the supplier of the LSD laced Chili dog sauce. Constable Remington and The Chaotix were never able to trace the stuff back to Renfield,but he still serves as a viable threat since he is still peddling to the public... Time will only tell if he attacks again.

<p><center> Mobius holds a mysterious secret, occasionally "zone portals" will open up out of nowhere and if you can locate a portal and get into it, you can access a mysterios "zone like" place known as the Cosmic Interstate! Winding along through space, From the cosmic interstate you can access a number of places from hidden zones to full parallel universes! In fact, theres one parallel universe that Sonic The Hedgehog accidentally stumbled into - namely the Anti-Mobius Universe: 
home to one of his greatest enemies - Evil Sonic! It wasn't until Evil Sonic's second pairing with Robotnik that the Anti-Knuckles came into play! Guardian of The Sunken Island, this echidna with a scottish rogue accent watches over 7 Chaos Emeralds which keeps an energy forcefield in and maintains oxygen levels in the sunken city of Atlantinopolis! The Anti-Sonic's only setback - whereas Knuckles will jump into a fight willy nilly, Anti Knux is a complete wimp! He won't even fight to defend his own
people - especially when Doctor Robotnik began draining the Choas Energy of the Island for his own personal use - thus cutting off the Oxygen supply. Whereas Knuckles relies on nature to get by, Anti-Knuckles depends heavily on the technology to keep him maintained! Anti-Knux was willing to help Knuckles only long enough to get back at Evil Sonic for double crossing him but overall he doesn't like Knux very much at all! Anti-Knux isn't the type to provoke action like most villians but he is willing to dish out if he can find ways other than doing this directly. He may not be as formidable a villain as Evil Sonic, but Anti-Knuckles can hold his own nonetheless...
