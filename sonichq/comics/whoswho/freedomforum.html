<p><center><b> <i>"Through time and space and alternate dimension, properties exist beyond comprehension. Artifacts of ancient and unfathomable power exist to aid and make men cower. Cognizant by beings of science and mystical shaman, a soverign royal and an emerald have nothing in common..."</i> In their own words - eons ago, the sun shone on the new world known as Mobius. Life began to evolve, centuries began to develop, and things began to go its course. But somewhere in betweenbalance was shot down as the sky turned an emerald green - weather began going crazy, life began to either die out or fade - and those that survived saw the coming of the Chaos Emeralds!They spawned worship, technological breakthroughs that drove those harnessing its energy completely mad, and in the hands of pure evil - they could be corrupted into weapons of complete destruction! But absolute energy cannot be created or destroyed and the infinite power of the chaos Emeralds shall realign for a higher purpose...The Chosen One who shall begin the great Gathering walks among them and the great harmony will then begin...Who is the Chosen? None other than Miles "Tails Prower" - and who deemed him so? None other than the Ancient Walkers - three mystical dieties that show up only when something GASTRONOMICALLY BIG happens in the Sonic Universe. Known to exhibit themselves previosly in the forms of dinosaurs - and now only in the forms of three floating tiki heads surrounded by a mystic energy, the Ancient Walkers speak in riddles and toungues, never revealing thier secrets and always a mystery. In fact the ONLY thing that is known is that Athair - Knuckles' Great grandfather, and possibly Merlin Prower - Tails' uncle, are the only ones that have direct contact to the Walkers.
Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails have been deemed "The Chosen Ones" and each have had thier respective meetings with Athair - Sonic and his Billionth Ring, Knuckles when he "died", and Tails' coming of age trip to Downunda as well as the first time he went "Super". Not even the powerful Mammoth Mogul was enough to stop Athair and The Walkers, and he has a Chaos Emerald slab embedded into his chest! For now the Walkers shall remain a perpetual mystery to all that know about them - but what thier TRUE intentions are for Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails especially, have yet to be revealed...

<p><center><b> Athair was a guardian - but he is the only one who willingly gave up the role...Out of the entire Sonic and Knuckles comics cast, Athair is the most mysterious character of them all - His past is so intertwined with Mobius' history, guardianship, Mitreship, and the Ancient Walkers that only he knows his whole story - period. Athair first met Tails on his trip to Downunda, infiltrating Robotniks base there led by Crocbot. After being attacked by the Wing Dingo Squadron and left for dead, The Downunda Freedom Fighters took Tails to "the old man of the crater". Tails woke up to find none other than a wrinkled old man, bent over with a cane...Deeming Tails "The chosen one", Athair told him that now was only the beginning of events that were to play forth in the future. Athair beholded tales of Mobius' ancient past, the coming of the great Chaos Emerald meteor, and also revealed the secret that the "Great Downunda crater" was once the place where The Floating Isle sat before it rose into the sky...How did Athair know all of this? The Ancient Walkers - three mystical diety like beings that come in the form of giant tribal masks. When Tails awoke from his daze like slumber in the crater - he found every existance of Athair gone within the blink of an eye...Fast forward to the coming of Mammoth Mogul - an ancient Wooly Mammoth with a Chaos Emerald literally embedded into his chest. After near-destroying Enerjak, Mogul, seeking to absorb the Chaos Emeralds of the Floating Island into himself - turned hyper and became Master Mogul: powered with the enegies of 14 Chaos Emeralds, it took Super Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, Turbo Tails, The Chaotix, and The Freedom Fighters - and NONE of the them could bring him down. That is - until Athair appeared. With the Ancient Walkers, Athair rescued Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails from dimensional limbo and dropped off the Chaos Syphon - the device used to create Enerjak. It was only with the syphon that the trio got the upper hand to defeat Mogul - but NOT before Athair vanished again....
So what is his relation to Knuckles and the guardians? It wasn't until weeks after the Mogul incident that Knuckles found out...Years ago - Athair himself was a guardian. Father to Sabre, Athair heeded what he called "a beckoning" from the Ancient Walkers. Following his call, he discovered The Forgotten Tribe - a group of Echidnas that decided to not go along with the decision to raise the Island. Simiar to Guardians, The tribe was led by "Mitres" instead. The most recent one had died - and Athair had just seemed to enter the picture. Out of sheer heart, Athair renounced the ways of the Guardian to help the poorer shambles that were the Forgotten Tribe find thier "Lost City Of Albion", homeland to the echidna race that had vanished centuries ago. Athair took Knuckles to see the Tribe, and on the last night of his mitreship, he vanished mysteriously again. Knuckles - with the help of Rob O' the Hedge, an echidna named Yanar, and Rob's betrothed Mari-An, located the city after more than a century of the Tribe looking. Knuckles still wonders to this day - whatever happened to Athair - but had he looked in the sky, he would have seen clouds in the shape of Athair and The Ancient walkers that smiled down upon him...

<p><center><b> Meet the last of our mystery men - Merlin Prower, a sorcerer and charlatan, Merlin was once under the reign of King Acorn as Royal Wizard - possibly after Ixis Naugus was banished by Robotnik. Those that DO know of his existance DONT even know of the person that they were actually meeting. Sonic met him only once as a child, trading a bag of "shiny stones" for Tails' sneakers, and as Sonic sped off - Merlin vanished in a puff of smoke. When Knuckles met him, he was on his quest for the Sword Of Acorns - and since he didn't know anything of Tails' real name - Miles Prower - Knux never made the connection to Merlin Prower. Tails knows possibly NOTHING of him, and neither does anyone else. However - it has been hinted at in spoilers that Merlin may posibly know of tails' role as The Chosen One. What he knows and when he wil take action is yet to be seen. But for right now - we, and Tails, will just have to wait....

<!--LINE1-->

<p><center><b> A "Native American-like" tribe of wolves, the Wolves were once a proud race, honored in thier heritage and living only off of what nature provided for them The lived in an uncharted area called "The Great Unknown" which lay just beyond the Great Canyon. However - shortly after Robotnik's coup of Mobotropolis, thier lives were thrust into turmoil as Robotnik ran them off of thier native lands, and roboticised thier people. Only a handfull are left unrobotisiced, while the rest fight valiantly to free thier lands. Princess Sally, Sonic, and Antione stumbled upon them after recieving a Freedom Fighter list via King Acorn (<i>Game Guy - Sonic SatAM</i>) and sought to unite other Freedom Fighters for thier cause. After some rather hilarious moments with Antione's "curse" and defeating a Waste Pod, the Wolf Pack Freedom Fighters became valuable allies ever since. The roster includes:

</p><p>
<LI><u>Lupe</u></b> - The leader of the Wolf Pack, Lupe is the oldest of everyone, somewhere along the lines of 30 years old. Already married and with children, Lupe left her home to protect the freedom of thier people while her husband Lobo stayed home to watch the children. That alone shows you how strong of a woman she is.   
<LI><b><u>Canus</u></b> - The second member of the group, Canus is the gentle giant. Large and burly, yet kind and well meaning, Canus serves as the strength of the group as well as its cook. He's mostly quiet and is the only member who can usually keep Reynard and Diablo from biting each others heads off.
<LI><b><u>Leeta And Lyco</b></u> - The third and fourth members - these pink wolves are the "identical twins" of the group. Both extremely acrobatic and wiry they work best as a team ALWAYS and are especially willing to help whenever needed.
<LI><b><u>Reynard</b></u> - Never one to spitefully lash out but ALWAYS one to question everything, reyanard was the person that first discovered Sonic, Sally, and Antione trespassing in the Wolf Caves. He's usually very inquisitive much to Diablo's nerves and this usually results in a tizzy between the two.
<LI><b><u>Diablo</b></u> - If ever there was a grump, Diablo is IT. Anyone remember Grouchy Smurf - give him fur and make him look like an animal and you have Diablo Wolf. This dark furred vulpine is the most stubborn and usually ends up getting into it with Reynard
<LI><b><u>Ariel and Athena</b></u> - Not pictured above: The final members of the group came MUCH LATER and caused quite an uproar aong the Wolf Pack when they came along. You see, Ariel and her sister Athena are two human girls. One being deaf, the other one being fully talkative, both are the lone survivors of a forgotten Overlander City...
<LI><b><u>Drago</b></u> - <i>(No longer a freedom fighter)</i> Needless to say, Drago WAS the traitor in the "Death Of Princess Sally" and has become a shame to the Wolf Pack - to find out more about him, <a href="/sonichq/comics/whoswho/robotnik2.html">click here</a>. 

<p><center><b> After helping rebuild Robotropolis during "Robotnik's death", the Wolfpack left to return to the Great Unknown and came to the Great Canyon, which was mysteriously COMPLETELY filled with water in a rainstorm: A possible allusion to the Ancient Walkers' "Day Of Fury". After crossing the canyon, Lupe and the others came across a deserted Overlander City and two girls - the ONLY SURVIVORS in in the town - Ariel and Athena. After much debate, instead of leaving the girls to die, Lupe decided to take them in and teach them the Wolf Packs ways as if they were thier own children. Since then, after forgetting about the shame of Drago, and adopting thier new "children", the Wolf Pack have always served whenever needed and make a valuable addition to the cast.

<p><center><b> If you thought the Kingdom of Acorn had its share of troubles, just wait till you see Downunda! The Australian equivalent on Mobius, Downunda is ruled by Robotnik's sub boss Crocbot. Tails discovered the Downunda Freedom Fighters affter going head to head with Crocbots Wing Dingo squadron. Taking him to Athair to be nursed back to health, the Downunda FF's show that they are just as caring as they are together as a team. The roster includes:
</p><p>
<LI><u>Walt Wallabee</u></b> - The leader of the group, Walt is one of the few male kangaroos with pouches. In it he stores his biggest weapon: The Bomberang! Walt has his eyes set on barby Koala but has most likely never told her yet   
<LI><b><u>Barby Koala</u></b> - The second member of the group, Tails already has a HUGE crush on her. Though Barby is MUCH older by standards she thinks Tails is kinda cute to. barby comes equipped with SHARP koala claws that can darn near hack through the sturdiest of items. She's almost more take charge than Walt at times but is apt to do whatever is needed of her.
<LI><b><u>Wombat Stu</b></u> - The youngest member of the group, Stu is blessed with super hearing and is also quick and agile due to his small size 
<LI><b><u>Guru Emu</b></u> - The weirdo and "group hippie", Guru Emu is asrelaxed as about anything can be. Though he can't fly he can dispense wisdom and thought in a heartbeat. 
<LI><b><u>Duck "Bill" Platypus</b></u> - The fighter and feistiest one of the group, Duck Bill will gladly give ANYTHING a right hook if it moves. The little "Pocket Popeye" comes from a tribe of other Platypus' that were part of a Crocbot mass hypnosis scheme that captured Emu and Wombat Stu. So far Bill has shaken off its effects and serves heartedly.

<p><center><b> So far, after Crocbot's final attempt at revenge by taking over the entire Platypus tribe only to end up disconnected, the DFF and thier country are currently free. But they still seek to rebuild so much of that which they have lost and often lend a hand to anyone whenever it is needed.

While Knuckles had come face to face with Athair, an associate named Yanar, and a group of "lost echidnas" known as The Forgotten Tribe, Sonic, on quest to find Ixis Naugus, discovered that the highsherriff was really the robotisiced father of Antione D'Coolette, one of the Knothile Village Freedom Fighters. Taken prisoner by General D'Coolette, Sonic, Tails, and Yanar awaited thier fate while Knuckles, Rob, and an echidna named Mari-An sought to find out what became of the passengers of Tails' crashed biplane and the now kidnapped Forgotten Tribe. Sonic and Tails, after thier own escape, helped Rob to free what was left of the Forgotten Tribe and save Yanar from facing a sentence of a public hanging but in the end it was not enough to restrain General D'Coolette who managed to escape in an explosion. Sonic and company rescued thier friends and The Forgotten Tribe and parted ways with Rob, vowing to return. Afterwards - while on a quest to locate the lost city of Albion with Knuckles, Rob discovered his true love in the form of Mari-An, the same echidna that assisted Knuckles before. Together the two stayed behind and continue to live in the castle once occupied by the Highsherriff.

<p><center><b> Many years ago, before the roboticiser, Robotnik dealt in the process of creating "cyborgs" - half human, half robot. However Robotnik quickly scrapped that project due to one disastrous result - Monkey Khan. Robotnik had built him to be TOO POWERFUL and as a result he ended up with a hotheaded powerhouse that he couldn't control. Locking Monkey Khan in a metallic crypt in which he couldn't escape, Khan rested there for 10 years until Sonic, Sally, and Antione accidentally discovered it and freed him. Sonic and Khan hit off on the wrong spot IMMEDIATELY and as a result they ended up fighting each other more than anything else. However in the long run they parted as friends as Khan left to return to his native home of the Dragon Kingdom. It wasn't until a few weeks later that Sonic and Tails discovered him at the base of Mount Stormtop under the control of The Iron King and Iron Queen. They managed to free Khan from teh grip of the Iron Queen as well as destroying her "Eternal Flame" spell that she had set upon Mount Stormtop. Khan decided to stay there among the simple villagers and live out his supposed destiny as prophecised "Monkey King" of the Dragon Kingdom. Since then he has defended the villagers from various attacks and remains an ally to Sonic. </tr></td>

<p><center><b> Believe it or not, The Floating Island is NOT the only place to find echidnas...sadly the Floating Island echidnas have forgotten the existence of "The Lost Tribe". Centuries ago before the appearance of the Great White Comet threatened the echidna civilization of Downunda, the people were thrown into an uproar in a debate over how to handle the coming of the comet. While one side argued to use the Chaos Emerald technology to "uplift" a portion if the ground, another side simply ventured that they seek land elsewhere. Led by a radical called Arrakis, they took only the technology that was needed and fled the site only to watch while the Echidnas used the expirimental technology to uplift the newly christened "Floating Island" and barely escaping the Comet which exploded upon impact and shaped out the Great Downunda Crater. The tribe traveled as far as they could seeking out the fabled lost city of Albion, but as each step grew more weary the little technology they had fizzled out and the became the victims of Overlander attacks, hard luck, getting run off of land, and even later on into the years - Robotnik assaults. Similar to Guardianship, The Tribe is led by a "Mitre" with Athair being prophecised as its last one, but in his last daysKnuckles took command and helped them to finally locate thier lost city - almost a century later. The tribe has now been accepted into Albion, where they are finally happy and free from the dangers and hardships they once experienced...
