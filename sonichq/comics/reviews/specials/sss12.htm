        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">W</font></b>ell, 
          here's yet another Sonic Special focusing on. Firstly, it retells the 
          "Turnabout Heroes" storyline that was featured in Comic Shop News as 
          a multi-part story.</font></p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Well, to make a long 
        story short, after some undetermined previous story, which appears set 
        up before Sonic #75, Sonic and Knuckles end up getting their minds switched, 
        and waking up in their respective home bases, expect they wake up in each 
        other's bodies. 
        <p></p>
        First plot hole right there: If their allies knew who was who, despite 
        their body switch, why did they bring them to different bases, instead 
        of keep both at the same base, where they could research how to switch 
        them back? 
        <p></p>
        After a brief Interlude where Dr Robonik (the Roboticized one, in his 
        disguised form) and Lord Dimitri are gloating together about how they 
        managed to do the mind switch (except Dimitri wanted to kill'em both) 
        <p></p>
        Okay, let's skim a bit: The FFs and Sonic/Knuckles go to the Floating 
        Island and everyone gets ambushed by a combined Swatbot/Dark Legion attack 
        force. 
        <p></p>
        Then, holo-images of Robo and Dimitri show up, and make a deal: Do something 
        for us, and we'll switch you back. Sonic and Knuckles seeemingly accept, 
        and are warped to the villain's base. 
        <p></p>
        Turns out they want the Master Emerald (what else?), which keeps the Master 
        Emerald aloft, so they can power a Chaos Cannon with it, Beta-testing 
        it on the Great Forest. Oddly enough, Sonic and Knuckles accept. 
        <p></p>
        They get warped to the Chaos chamber, talk a bit, then touch the Master 
        Emerald, which emits a blinding flash, which knocks out the spy cam the 
        bad guys were using on them. They then get warped back, and hand over 
        the Master Emerald, which the baddies put in the cannon and fire... 
        <p></p>
        Of course, as you've probably guessed, that Emerald was bogus and scrapped 
        the Chaos Cannon. Sonic and Knuckles (who had their minds switched back 
        by the real Master Emerald, aka the Plot Device) mop the floor with the 
        goon squads, then face the villains, who make their respective escapes 
        (Robotnik's being the "Blow-up the robot body" approach). 
        <p></p>
        Story ends with Sonic and Knuckles exchanging "friendly nemesis" banter, 
        which is now obviously friendly ribbing, rather then the all out character 
        attacks they used to be. 
        <p></p>
        <b>Rating: 0 Rings.</b> 
        <p>Poorly written story, with little believable characterisation, major 
          plot holes, and all-out gross errors all around. In one scene, we see 
          Antoine carrying a rifle, when it's established in K#21 that Mobians 
          <b>never</b> use guns...</p>
        <p></p>
        The problem here is that this story was first written as a way to introduce 
        new readers to the Sonic and Knuckles universe in the CSN comic strip 
        mini-series. So it takes some "liberties" with the comic's world. That 
        and the 14 parter format of the mini-series kept the writers from writing 
        a full storyline with the story concept. 
        <p></p>
        Which is a shame, since the "mind and body switch" concept had quite some 
        potential as a stand-alone storyline, featuring both heroes not only adapting 
        to new bodies, but getting a look at the world through the eyes of the 
        other, which would've built a better bond between them... 
        <p></p>
        Instead, the concept was wasted on a cheap publicity gambit to draw in 
        more readers, which was reused because they obviously needed a filler 
        of some sort... 
        <p></p>
        Now, the second storyline is another Zone War story. 
        <p></p>

          <b>Zone Wars: &quot;Giant Robotno&quot;</b> 
        </center>
        <p></p>
        Sonic is having a bad day, it seems... First off, his day off fishing 
        is suddenly interrupted by a ship flying through a dimensional warp, with 
        it's pilot, a counterpart of Princess Sally, showing up and asking Sonic 
        for help with a problem. 
        <p></p>
        Before Sonic can give a definite answer, Zonic the zone cop shows up, 
        reveals that Sally to be an evil counterpart, Sallactor, and calls up 
        her own enemies from the Sentai Zone, the "Science Ninja Team Sonicman", 
        consisting of Sonic, Amy, Knuckles, Tails and, surprisingly, Rotor. (if 
        you don't know what Sentai or that team name mean, go to your search engine 
        and look up "Sentai" and "Science Ninja Team Gatchaman"; you might get 
        the jokes then) 
        <p></p>
        While the transdimensional heroes fight their foe using their Sentai techniques, 
        Sonic is just walking around, feeling really turned off by all this "Zone 
        Zapping" business (We all know how you feel, Sonic), and asks why Zonic 
        bothers to keep track of it all; Zonic tells Sonic it's his job, that's 
        all. He has to go from Zone to Zone, fixing problems, and that often means 
        getting people to where they can help the most. And Sonic gets called 
        the most because he's Sonic Prime, the original version (Some SegaSonic 
        fans might argue that point, though...) 
        <p></p>
        Before the conversation can go further (and after the Sentai guys are 
        warped back home), ZOnic gets an urgent mission call: Some dimension needs 
        urgent help, or millions will die. After some original waffling, Sonic 
        agrees to help, and gets Zoned to a world of Overlanders. 
        <p></p>
        After a few seconds, he sees the major threat: A giant, mutated version 
        of Bunnie Rabbot, Rabbotzilla!! To quote Zonic: "Good and Evil are relative 
        concepts in other zones". 
        <p></p>
        After a moment of hesitation, Sonic finally revs up and runs towards the 
        giant Bunnie, melting the tar under her and trapping her in a makeshift 
        flytrap. 
        <p></p>
        After his victory, Sonic meets the welcome wagon, which includes a good 
        Dr Robotnik, Doctor J. Kintobor, and gets some answers as to what the 
        deak with this Zone is: Turns out this Doc Kintobor split the Chaos Emerald 
        to try and harness the Chaotomic energy, doing it on Knothole Island, 
        and accidentally mutating the animals into their present giant forms, 
        and inexplicably, started to attack Kintopolis (well, if you'd gotten 
        mutated, wouldn't you be ticked at the guys who did it?) 
        <p></p>
        Kintobor has tried everything against those giant mutants: armies (that 
        got vaped), robo-viruses (got Uncle Chuck's counterpart, but Bunnie is 
        only part-robotic now, like her real self), and a trio of giant robots 
        that lack a power source, as of yet. They need the split halves of the 
        Chaos Emerald to work. And Sonic's gonna help get those. 
        <p></p>
        Sonic agrees to become both the pilot and the power source (treadmill 
        style) for "Giant Robotno", a Super Robot in Kintobor's image (it must 
        be a common malady in all versions, good or bad). 
        <p></p>
        Sonic flies the giant Mecha to Knothole Island, where, to his horror, 
        he finds himself pitted against monstrous versions of his friends: Tails, 
        Amy, Rotor, Knuckles and Sally... 
        <p></p>
        Following a harrowing fight against his own friends, which wears down 
        on both his body and his will, Sonic now finds himself against a truly 
        nightmarish scenario: his own mutated father, who has half the Chaos Emerald 
        inbedded in his chest. 
        <p></p>
        After a brief struggle, Sonic accidentally rips the Emerald off of giant-Jules' 
        chest, and the large mutant keels over, apparantly dying... Sonic, in 
        horror, flies off, still clutching the Emerald. Moments later, <b>his</b> 
        giant, mutated counterpart appears, approaches it's dead father, and howls 
        in a mornful wail, seemingly swearing revenge... 
        <p></p>
        Back in Kintopolis, the people are rejoicing, now that their first mechanized 
        guardian is fully operational. Sonic just wants to leave, and does so 
        as soon as Zonic shows up, leaving Kinotbor to wonder who was that young 
        hero, who's shape he gave the first robot, and which he wanted to name 
        after... (May we suggest Metal-Sonic?) 
        <p></p>
        Back in his home-dimension, Zonic congratulates Sonic for a job well done, 
        since now the people in that dimension will be able to defend themselves. 
        Unfortunately, Sonic's in no mood to celebrate... he <b>did</b> kill a 
        version of his own dad, after all. 
        <p></p>
        Zonic, to reassure Sonic, takes off his own helmet and reveals himself 
        as being another version of Sonic, before warping away, leaving Sonic 
        with more questions...

        <p>This story was actually pretty good; good, dramatic storyline, clever 
          characterisation, a few nice, poignant moments, and even an ambiguous 
          ending. Would've been better if they'd skipped that silly "Sentai Zone" 
          scene, though. All in all, this was a better story.</p>
