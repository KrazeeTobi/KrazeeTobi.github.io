          is my review of SSS#9, Sonic kids 2, the further adventures of the young 
          freedom fighters. This issue blends some really cool adventure with 
          some very touching scenes, and reveals more of the past of our favorite 
          heroes, and clears up a few mysteries. All the stories were written 
          by Michael Gallagher, who shows a remarkable gift for touching dramatic 
          stories.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&quot;Zoneward 
          Bound"</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first story 
          is Zoneward Bound, illustrated by Sam Maxwell; We meet up with the young 
          FFs as they are playing snow battle, divided in teams (Sonic and Tails, 
          Rotor and Sally, and Antoine's alone. Sorry dude, Bunnie's not there 
          yet) and generally pummelling poor Antoine with snow balls. One ball 
          goes stray, and hits Rosie. Antoine says she's Sally's Au Pair, which, 
          according to Gabrie's caption, is french for nanny. I doubt it, since 
          I'M french, and we don't use that expression. In fact, it's the first 
          time I've heard of it! I guess Manny needs to get a better french-english 
          dictionnary. Sally gets a scolding from Rosie, and gies into a pout 
          and cry mode that gets everyone sad (either she's sincere, or she's 
          a REALLY good actress!) Rosie apologises for losing her temper and proposes 
          that they go skating on the frozen pond.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They go play a game 
          of hockey, with Sonic ending up hogging the puck and playing solo at 
          super speed while the others are skating around, watching him play. 
          Unfortunetly, he tries so hard to impress his friends that he ends up 
          melting the ice with friction heat! They decide to wiat besides the 
          pond for the ice to freeze up again. Sonic, getting thirsty, goes to 
          a nearby well to get a drink. (Apparantly, Sonic has been this well 
          in an earlier issue. I dont know which, but then I don't consider myself 
          a hardcore know-it-all...) He brings up a bucket of frozen water (that 
          was to be expected) with a golden ring embedded in it! That pond must 
          be the power ring lake. Asking themselves wheter or not it has worth, 
          the young FFs demonstrate that they are obviously unaware of it's true 
          nature as a power ring. They leave it by the side of the pond (which 
          has now refrozen) and go back skating to do "the whip", unaware that 
          the ring has started to glow. After a brief stint of that infamous song 
          (very disturbing, coming from them), They go out of control and slip 
          towards some weird floating concentric circles, Sally falling in one, 
          Sonic in the other, and Rotor, Tails and Antoine in the third. End of 
          Part one.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part two: Sally 
          falls out of the circle gateway and lands in a rollercoaster in some 
          weird zone. After a brief wild ride, she quickly grasps control of the 
          situation again, following the teachings of her mentor. At the end of 
          the ride is a giant image of her father's face in cristallized form, 
          confuses her, before the chariot falls off the end of the ride and she 
          falls through the face, shattering it. She then monologuees that her 
          whole world is shattered and the she and the FFs will try to be up to 
          the challenge to carry on in the duties of taking over for him, and 
          the scene ends, going straight to the three other FFs. Hmm. Not the 
          best way to end a scene, in my opinion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tails, Rotor and 
          Antoine are in this really weird zone where their respective body parts 
          keep getting traded between one another. Rotor says in one oanel that 
          he thinks they've been transported into a weird zone. Sharp one, ain't 
          he? Antoine finds the exit and they float away, their bodies back as 
          they should be. Rotor says there's a lesson to be learned here, and 
          Antoine agrees: Don't go skating with Sonic! Tails corrects Antoine 
          by saying that dispite what happened, they stuck together and made it 
          out as a team, so this must be some kind of sign! next panel, We see 
          the Ancient Walkers (or at least their masks) observing that the Chosen 
          One (Tails, this proves it!) displays insight, and that they will meet 
          him soon! End of part two.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We meet up with 
          Sonic as he finds himself in a zone. He muses that his friends doesn't 
          know that he's been in one before with Ray and Mighty (the Sonic Arcade 
          game, which will be seriealized in Knux#26). This one is still under 
          construction, so Sonic decides to go see who's building these things, 
          and runs done the Zone pathway, gathering rings as he goes. He instead 
          makes his first meeting with Robotnik instead in a Green hill Zone setting 
          that looks to be under construction. We don't know what Robotnik is 
          looking for but we do know Sonic kicks his tail but good before he ends 
          up speeding out of the zone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FFs all exit 
          the zones and land together right back where they started. Before Sally 
          can finish saking to to so, Sonic grabs the bucket and the ring back 
          in the well where they found it. And for a finish, Rosie arrives (oblivious 
          to what has happened) with fresh Pecan Rings for everone. Like they 
          needed new rings...</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this wasn't a bad story, considering how they just skimmed through the 
          zones and experiences. The ending seemed a little to easy, considering 
          how they just went through what would be harrowing experiences for any 
          other children. Still, it was a fascinating story of wonder and marvel, 
          like a fairy tale experience.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;My 
          Secret Guardian&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next 
          story: My Secret Guardian; a pre-Robotnik story, this one tells the 
          tlae of Sally and Knuckle's first meeting, mentionned in Sonic #39, 
          the Mecha-Madness special and Sonic #44. It starts with Sally and her 
          father preparing for a trip to a secret place: The Floating Island. 
          How DO you keep a huge thing like an Island secret, anyway? You'd think 
          SOMEONE would notice it every once in while... The King tells Sally 
          that this is a vacation, but doesn't tell her that he's actually looking 
          for his long-lost wife and son. She's been through enough, he reasons. 
          Needless to say, she is extremely surprised when she first sees the 
          island. As they land, a familliar silhouette hides in the bushes, observing...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sally 
          is just extatic about the Island, and wants to go out exploring as soon 
          as possible. She also hears something in the bushes, meaning she already 
          knows about the eavesdropper. Her father has to excuse himself for a 
          moment, as he has to pay his respects to guardian (in other words, he 
          has to grill him for all he's worth about the whereabouts of his family), 
          leaving Sally to wonder around (most parents would tell their kids to 
          stay put. Must be this reverse psychology we keep hearing about). Sally, 
          a bit miffed, decides to take it out on the eavesdropper and, displaying 
          her extraordinary level of combat training (for her age), does a back 
          flip, grabs a stick and orders him to show himself. It turns out to 
          be young Knuckles, and they introduce themselves, Sally showing off 
          her titles, Knux explaining his matter-of-factly.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
          soon become friends, as they have a lot in common (Like incredible duties 
          to take over, and parents who keep a lot of secrets from them). But 
          an argument starts as to who has to most duties to take on (silly, I 
          know, but these are kids here!): Sally thinks being a guardian is small 
          potatoes compared to the planetary throne, while Knux thinks he's got 
          it much tougher, since HE doesn't get vacation time (he needs a better 
          union), and the argument turns into a fight. The fight ends abruptly 
          when Knux accidently brakes a tree. Knuckles is distraught at having 
          destroyed a part of the island's eco-system (psst! It's just ONE tree, 
          Knux! It's not as if you clear-cutted half the forest!), while Sally 
          blames herself for not having been able to get along. Knuckle's dad 
          starts to call out from Off-Screen, and Knux is concerned about his 
          dad finding out he's violated Guardian training rules. Sally vows to 
          keep the friendship a secret, no matter what. The pact is sealed. Sally 
          hides from sight as Knux goes to meet her dad.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afterwards, 
          Sally is sad because she has to hide her friendship and hopes losing 
          the people she cares about won't become a standard feature of her life 
          (sorry girl, but it will...) Her father meets up with her sometimes 
          has she thinks this and they hug, with Sally just happy her dad's alright. 
          Her father says the guardian was a nice echidna and that he has a son 
          about her age (no kidding!), but he was unavailable. Sally reassures 
          him by saying she has a lot of friends back home: Sonic, Boomer, Antoine... 
          But she's glad she spending time with her father. As thye go off exploring 
          under the glow of the setting sun, Knuckles watches them from a nearby 
          cliff, thinking that he feels that she and him will meet again someday.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this was a very good story. Short and sweet, it reveals the details 
          of Sally's first encounter with Knuckles, while explaining why this 
          was kept secret (I think it's a lot of fuss over a tree, but I'm no 
          tree-hugger)... All in all, a very good story.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Eve 
          of Destruction&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third 
          and final story: Eve if Destruction; the tale (pun intended) of the 
          birth of Miles Prower, aka Tails. This is a bitter-sweet story if I've 
          ever read one. you'll see.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When join Sally, 
          Sonic, Boomer (aka Rotor) and Antoine playing ball in front of the Prower 
          residence. Mr Amadeus Prower (who looks just like an adult Tails with 
          an eye patch) asks them to go away gently, as his wife needs rest, and 
          they comply, Sally saying that Mrs Rosemary Prower is about to have 
          a child. As they leave, we see Amadeus and Rosemary talking. She wishes 
          he didn't have to go, but he has duties as a member of the Royal Guard 
          (second in command, after Antoine's father, no doubt), But today, the 
          King will dissolve the Mobian Military, after appointing Warlord Julian 
          to the ministry of Science, since the previous minister, Sir Charles, 
          resigned after a classified experiment went horribly wrong (the roboticizer 
          test that left Jules a mindless machine). Amadeus then leaves, intrusting 
          the care of his wife to the young future Freedom Fighters.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We cut to the Royal 
          Science Lab, where Julian is gloating about how, now that he has the 
          lab, he has all he needs to succeed in his takeover plans. The roboticizer, 
          especially, is vital to his plans, and he intends to test it right away, 
          with a poor beaver as test subject. It is at this time that Amadeus 
          arrives, witnessing the roboticization. He confronts Julian and arrests 
          him. Julian, cool as winter, just states that he'd rather be known as 
          Ivo Robotnik form now on, and that he been planning this takeover for 
          a while. AS Amadeus starts to threaten him to surrender, Ivo (still 
          calm) announces that he's already built himself some more mechanical 
          minions. Just as Amadeus is about to finally shoot the guy, Ivo (Still 
          Cool! This guy's got guts!) introduces him to one of them, who is now 
          behind Amadeus: The Swatbot!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, Rosemary 
          goes into labor. While she and Sonic go check on her, Sally, guessing 
          at what's happening, gets Boomer and Antoine to get her wagon. They 
          find Mrs Prower, and carrying her on the wagon at super-speed, Sonic 
          and Sally get her to the hospital on time. A short while later, little 
          Miles is delivered, and the kids get a big congratulations for saving 
          the day. As the King takes the baby to look at him, they see he has 
          two tails! As they all wonder where Miles's dad is, he,completly dressed 
          in sterile clothing (you can't even see his face), arrives with Julian 
          and Snively , apparantly all "buddy-buddy"! Rosemary hands him the baby 
          to see, but he justs turns around and walks away, as if it meant nothing! 
          Rosemary, distraught, starts to cry as Dr Quack and the King try to 
          reassure her that her husband is probably only under a lot of mental 
          pressure at the thought of being a new father. Julian says he'll keep 
          an eye on amadeus, and he and Snively foolow him out of the clinic, 
          but not before the King reminds him that he intends to see that after 
          the dismantling ceremony is finished, there will be some changes around 
          here, to which Julian simply states that yes, there will.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we shift the 
          scene to the outside of the clinic, we see that Amadeus has been indeed 
          roboticized, which explains his cold attitude towards his family. Back 
          in the clinic, mrs Prower has cried herself to sleep, and now poor Miles 
          is crying himself. Sonic takes him, which calms him down. Sonic simply 
          states, prophetically, that he and Miles are going to be fast friends.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, This is certainly 
          a bitter-sweet story, just like I said. That one moment where Robo-Amadeus 
          looks at his wife and son, then just turns away, has to be the most 
          tear-wrenching moment I ever saw since Titanic's famous "Live on for 
          me, Rose!" speech! It is also surprising to see how easily Robotnik 
          took over the kingdom. The King practically gave him all he needed to 
          do so! I've read and re-read this story, and I can honestly find nothing 
          so wrong with it that it spoils my reading.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was, without 
          a doubt, the best Super Sonic Special in ages! If you try to forget 
          the inadaquacies of SSS#8 (and if you can, tell me how) then this tops 
          most of the other specials that have been, including the last Sonic 
          Kids Special! The art was excellent, the stories believable, mind blowing 
          and absolutly heart-wrenching. This is clichéd, I know, but I laughed, 
          I cried, I couldn't stop reading! If they keep up this level of quality, 
          I'll be an avid reader forever!</font></p>
