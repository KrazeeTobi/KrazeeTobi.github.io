          <b>Female Furries of Mobius</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">W</font></b>ell, this special was a decent one, especially after the last "Special". It's basically a spot-light on the various female heroes of Mobius, with more introspective stories to show us some character developement. Let's go by them one by one:</font></p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

          <b>Princess Sally: &quot;Ascension&quot;</b> 
          <p></p>
        </center>
        This story, apparently set before the royal family left Mobotropolis again 
        in Sonic #75, has Princess Sally, take that fateful dip into the Source 
        of All, under the watchful eye of her brother, Elias. He wants her to 
        bond with the Source so she can assume the title of Queen someday. Before 
        she does, she has an internal dialogue telling us all her life she never 
        had many choices: She was by birth the heir to the throne, but had that 
        title taken away when her brother came back. Now, she has to choose whether 
        or not she wants to bond with the Source and ascend to the throne. 
        <p></p>
        Within the Source, Sally relives some past moments of her life, speaks 
        with visions resembling her father and brother (the present), and speaks 
        to a future version of herself, from whom she learns that those who bond 
        with the Source become aware of things to come. To demonstrate this, Sally 
        gets a vision of things to come, from 20 years later (as shown in many 
        different issues: Sally and Sonic, married with twins), where she sees 
        her family under attack once more. Before she can learn anymore, she must 
        bond with the Source. 
        <p></p>
        The catch? It's all or nothing. One either bonds with the Source or one 
        doesn't become queen at all. Sally has a tough choice now. Sally chooses 
        not to know the future and exits the Source, telling her brother this 
        is not the way for her. She has to find her own way. 
        <p></p>
        Well, the art was nice, albeit a bit flat. The story was short and nice, 
        but not very interesting. But the plot had a few holes in it: If Sally 
        refused to bond with the Source, why did she see a future version of herself 
        as Queen? And what of the vision of the future, so far in accordance to 
        the "canon" version of Mobius' future? If Sally doesn't become queen, 
        can it still happen? Or does Sally's ascendance to the Throne have nothing 
        to do with the Source of All? At the end of this story, we're left with 
        a few more answers than questions.

          <b>Hershey: &quot;Solo&quot;</b> 
          <p></p>
        </center>
        This story is set in the present time-frame. Hershey sneaks into Dr. Robotnik's 
        inner sanctum to spy on him and find out what happened to Valdez the chameleon 
        (He was roboticized, as revealed in Both Knuckles #30 and #31) There's 
        really not much more to this story. We get another cameo of General D'Coolette 
        (I gotta write a letter to those writers for mucking up a prefectly good 
        French name like that), and we get a few nice explosions. But there's 
        not much introspection nor a lot of plot development.

          <b>Lupe and the Wolfpack: &quot;Family&quot;</b> 
          <p></p>
        </center>
        This one features the Wolfpack, having finally returned to their own hometown, 
        only to find it in ruins. They are suddenly ambushed and find themselves 
        prisoners of Uncle Chuck, who's been reprogrammed into a loyal lieutenant 
        of Robotnik's. Lupe also finds, to her anger, that her husband, Lobo, 
        and her children, Marcos and Maria, have been roboticized as well. Unable 
        to struggle, the pack is lead to a roboticizer, with Lupe getting first 
        turn. But after being roboticized, Lupe still finds the strength of will 
        to use her new robotic body to knock out Chuck and his Shadowbots and 
        thus free the rest of the pack. But she's not going with them. She's staying 
        with her family, as she feels her mind fading... 
        <p></p>
        Afterwards, the Wolfpack leaves a marker in Lupe's memory behind them 
        as they walk off into the sun-set (and character limbo, along with Rotor 
        and the 40 fathoms FF), which seems suspiciously like a grave... 
        <p></p>
        Well, this story was short, depressing and poorly executed. Lupe was a 
        good reocurring character, who deserved better then to be "killed off" 
        in a "Special" in such a lousy manner. On a related note, Archie's getting 
        into the habit of "killing off" unused characters more and more frequently. 
        Since our old favorite, Rotor, is no longer in the spotlight as of late, 
        this does not bode well for our friend.

          <b>Bunnie Rabbot: &quot;Upgrade&quot;</b> 
          <p></p>
        </center>
        Bunnie Rabbot finds herself victim of a serious condition: her robotic 
        limbs, in their present state, are slowly killing her. There are three 
        solutions: have the limbs removed (amputating her three ways), upgrading 
        the limbs' hardware, which would remove any chance for her to get de-roboticized 
        in the future, or chance a deroboticization now, with the odds against 
        her survival. 
        <p></p>
        After a short one-page scene where Antoine gives Bunnie moral confort, 
        saying he'll love her whatever she chooses (aaaww... Who says the French 
        aren't romantic?), Bunnie finally goes for option #2: Getting the upgrade. 
        After Nate (the new expert in all things technological) finishes the upgrade 
        work, we see Bunnie has gotten a new look out of it: Sleeker, more natural, 
        and more feminine than her old limbs (and it includes a flight mode). 
        As Bunnie rockets into the skies, we see Bunnie has accustomed herself 
        to the idea she'll be a cyborg for the rest of her life. 
        <p></p>
        Well, the more I see of Fry's art, the more I like it. His Bunnie looks 
        great, and his Antoine doesn't look ridiculous: a good combo in my book 
        (but then I like Antoine). Ken Penders did a great job of the characterization 
        here, and made us feel for Bunnie.

          <b>Julie-Su: &quot;Shadows&quot;</b> 
          <p></p>
        </center>
        Julie-Su, Knuckles' girl-friend, decides one fine day that she can't face 
        the future with first facing her past once more. So she goes and pays 
        a visit to her old home: The Dark Legion base from way back in Knuckles 
        #3. Once she arrives at the now abandoned and run-down base, she begins 
        to remember her past there, living as a Dark Legionnaire, and recalls 
        how Kragok and the female called Komissar didn't like her much. She also 
        finds someone hiding there: A former Dark Legionnaire called Simon, who 
        knows Julie-Su. He and his wife Floren-Ca cared for Julie in her youth 
        as if they were her parents. She doesn't remember him, so he goes on to 
        tell her all about her origins: 
        <p></p>
        Moritori's own son, Luger, got married to a femme called Merin-Da and 
        had two kids: a son called Kragok, and a daughter called Lien-Da (apparently, 
        females inherit the second part of their names from their mothers). Years 
        afterwards, when the DL got back to the Floating Island, Merin-Da got 
        sick and died. Years later, Luger fell in love again and married young 
        female Mari-Su, much to the bitterness of the now teenage Kragok and Lien-Da. 
        Luger and Mari-Su had a child of their own, called, you guessed it, Julie-Su. 
        Needless to say, her half-brother and half-sister didn't like her very 
        much. As if that wasn't bad enough, Julie-Su's mother died in an accident. 
        Since Luger wasn't much of a parent (Kragok and Lien-Da being clear proof), 
        Julie was entrusted to the care of Floren-Ca. 
        <p></p>
        Afterwards, Luger himself disappeared without a trace, under mysterious 
        circumstances, leaving Kragok behind to take command. Then, he and Lien-Da 
        decided to get rid of Julie-Su, by activating a memory erasure implant 
        which all Dark Legionnaires receive at birth (seems silly, but then I'm 
        no DL). Julie-Su, now pretty much a blank slate, was raised by Simon and 
        Floren-Ca as if she was their own daughter, until they took her away from 
        them, wiped her memories again and trained her as a DL grunt. 
        <p></p>
        After Julie-Su was taken from them, Simon and Floren-Ca stayed behind 
        on the Floating Island when the DL went back into their prison Zone. When 
        they later learned of Julie-Su's return, Simon went to the base to collect 
        evidence to show her her past. After this reunion, Julie-Su leaves with 
        Simon to get better acquianted with both him and the woman who served 
        as her mother during her childhood. She wanted to face her past, and she's 
        getting all that and more. 
        <p></p>
        This was a great story. Best in this special, in my opinion. Spaz shows 
        us again why he's the king of Sonic art, and Ken's story was great. This 
        story finally clears up Julie-Su's past, and opens up some great venues 
        for dramatic stories (Julie-Su, now being a distant descendant of Dimitri's 
        [distant enough not to be a close cousin of Knuckles'], has a direct claim 
        to the leadership of the Dark Legion). Shame this is happenning now that 
        the Knux comic is being cancelled...
