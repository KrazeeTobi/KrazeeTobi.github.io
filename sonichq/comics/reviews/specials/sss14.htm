          this issue of "Sonic Super Special", we get a Sonic "Zone Wars" story, 
          "Law of the Land" and a new Knuckles story, "Best of Times, Worst of 
          Times".</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The title of the 
          Knuckles story in this Special seems to fit the entire issue: there's 
          an awful Sonic story, and then a great Knuckles Story after it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, the mediocre 
          (at best) Sonic story.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Law 
          of the Land"</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plotted by Evan 
          Skolnick and written by Jim Spivney, this isn't a very impressive story...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sonic is walking 
          in the forest with Sally, complaining about how quiet things have been 
          lately (so this is outside of normal continuity, or else Sonic wouldn't 
          be bored, what with Dr Robotnik having come back and all). Of course, 
          Sonic complaining about boredom automatically summons trouble from a 
          Zone, which comes in the form of 2 Echidna Cops who grab Sonic, knock 
          out Sally and drag the Hedgehog into their Zone, Ligitopolis.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There, Sonic finds 
          out he's been charged with "Extreme Emotional Anguish and Permanent 
          Mental Scarring" In other words, he's being arrested for insulting someone. 
          He's brought before this world's version of Robotnik, the J.U.D.G.E. 
          (Judgemental Unrelenting Digitized Government Enforcer), a tyrannical 
          computerised Judge who, aided by his DA Johnny Snively, enforces a ridiculously 
          harsh number of laws over the city.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sonic fortunately 
          gets bailed out by his defense attorney, Sally McAcorn, who also explains 
          the situation: in this world, King Acorn was having trouble with law 
          breakers, so he toughened up the laws. Toughening up the laws, however, 
          leads everyone to sue everyone else, so the courts couldn't keep up. 
          So King Acorn has the J.U.D.G.E. built to handle the workload, but it 
          takes over everything and has the king arrested for letting the situation 
          get out of hand... A vicious cycle indeed. which gets worst since everyone's 
          now afraid of getting sued or arrested for breaking one of the J.U.D.G.E.'s 
          new laws.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sonic, wanting to 
          help, first tries the direct approach (full frontal assault to shut 
          down the J.U.D.G.E.), and fails at that, nearly getting a charge of 
          High Treason added to his crimes list. He finds Sally, who shows him 
          an amateur tape of Evil Sonic performing the crimes Sonic was accused 
          of, before escaping into a Zone Portal. So Sonic was actually framed 
          (once more) by his Evil Twin. Surprise, surprise...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunately, Sonic 
          finally comes up with an idea to get rid of the J.U.D.G.E. once and 
          for all: Perform countless minor crimes until the J.U.D.G.E. gets so 
          overloaded with them it blows up... which it does, freeing everyone 
          from it's tyrannical rule, allowing the people of Ligitopolis to create 
          a new, more fair legal system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But, just as Sonic 
          is gonna get a kiss from the girl (so much for loyalty to the original 
          Sally), Zonic comes around and warps Sonic back home first. Just goes 
          to show you folks: You shouldn't cheat on your girlfriend, not even 
          with her outer-dimensional counterpart.</font></p>

          1 Ring</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This wasn't a very 
          good story: the story concept was wierd, the story was cheaply executed, 
          and the art was terrible. Not much else I can say here, except I hope 
          to forget this terrible story existed...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But fortunetly, 
          we are then given another story which gives us hope for the future:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knuckles, 
          in <b>"Best of Times, Worst of Times"</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The story begins 
          with a teaser scene of Knuckles trying to outrun what seems like an 
          explosion/energy wave, before getting blown off the Island and into 
          the ocean below, where he emerges and collapses on a piece of driftwood.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flashback to the 
          scene of Lara-Le and Wynmacher's wedding a few hours before, where Knuckles 
          and friends were guests. There, he also sees Constable Remington, who 
          doesn't stay long, as he's suddenly called on duty.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jump to Haven, where 
          the Brotherhood gathers to meet yet ANOTHER long lost member, Grandfather 
          Mathias, who's left the normal plane of existence to live in another 
          dimension. He warns his descendents that Dimitri has gathered his forces 
          and is preparing for a new battle. The Brotherhood decide to do something 
          about it...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We skip to Knuckles, 
          who's taking a horse ride with his friends, trying to relax for once 
          in his life, as they ride out of the city, going somewhere...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut again to Remington 
          whom, after escorting his date home, gets a ride and some info from 
          Harry the Dingo cabby, who tells him that General Stryker's gotten tired 
          of Echidna politics and has decided to lead his troops against the Echidna 
          government, to make their "demands" clearer. As Remington walks back 
          into his station, we get the feeling violence is gonna brew up...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From that point 
          on, things begin to speed up: We cut back to our boy Knux, who has lead 
          his friends to the old Dark Legion compound, which they've decided to 
          investigate for clues...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...While, back at 
          the old Grand Conservatory, the Brotherhood have discovered the Dark 
          Legion is looting the old Technology depository. They attack the Legionnaires 
          to teach them a lesson...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Meanwhile, Lara-Le 
          and her new husband arrive at a mountain retreat to enjoy their honeymoon, 
          oblivious to the violence that begins to rock different parts of the 
          Island...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Back in Echidnapolis, 
          Von Stryker leads his forces in insurrection, against Remington and 
          his police forces...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Back at the DL 
          Compound, Julie-Su gets kidnapped just as Knuckles and the Chaotix get 
          attacked by Legionnaires, keeping them from saving her...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Back in Haven, 
          Hawking finally leaves this mortal coil, rejoining his ancestors...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Julie-Su is brought 
          to a DL ship flying near the island, confronts her evil half-sister 
          and is put in a cell with Simon and Floren-Ca, her previous surrogate 
          parents. There, Dimitri wants her kept safe, as she's as much a part 
          of her family as his more evil kin.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the moment she's 
          safe, Dimitri has his forces execute a new plan: his ship fires a Quantum 
          Beam at the island, which creates the Energy Wave we saw earlier, apparently 
          desintegrating everyone on the Island, but actually, as Dimitri claims, 
          sending them into another Zone, much like was done to the DL before, 
          leaving the Island itself without any opposition for the Legion's conquest.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Except that, 
          floating on the Ocean underneath the island, one lone Guardian is floating 
          on a piece of driftwood...</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This story quite 
          simply ROCKED! In one story, Ken Penders shakes up the Knuckles with 
          such an impact, you can't help but want to read more! In one story, 
          Knuckles' continuity has been cleared of Echdinapolis, The Brotherhood, 
          and the annoying bit of Knuckles no longer being the only Echidna on 
          Mobius. And Knuckles will now have the long term goal of bringing back 
          his people from that Zone... a Goal which should prove elusive at best, 
          if this story is any indication.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I'm looking 
          forward to reading more Knuckles stories now. Maybe we should ask Ken 
          do write a story like for Sonic, huh?</font></p>
