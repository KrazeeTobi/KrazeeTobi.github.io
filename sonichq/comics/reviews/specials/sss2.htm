<center><p><b>Ken's cover: an actual painting rather than something
computer-generated.  Something about the thumbnail cover made me
think that Sally expression would be more bittersweet than it is
here.  In the background, Geoffrey poses for a statue while Dulcy
flies to a clinic to have someone examine her varicose wings.
     
<p>Frontispiece: I suppose the word here is "radiant."  Either
that or "Photoshop."
     
<p>Sam Maxwell splash page: Sonic, Antoine, Bunnie and Dulcy
raise SOMETHING meant to resemble a flag while Sally looks on and
Tails happily falls off a cliff.  He's getting better at it. 
Maxwell's drawing, not Tails' falling.  I've made this suggestion
separately but it bears repeating: since Ken or Manny Galan or
someone went to the trouble of designing a corporate logo for the
Dingo Empire or whatever, is anyone out there up to designing aflag of Mobius?
     
<p>And THIS TIME I bothered to read the text; now I know why I
skipped it up until now.  Frankly, it's overwritten, awkward, and
quite simply inaccurate in spots.  Consider the last sentence in
the first paragraph: "He had sought to enslave them through his
nefarious schemes, with ultimate domination over all he surveyed
his final goal."  This looks like two sentences jammed together
with at least one clause missing.  At the very least, the words
"he surveyed" could have been dropped back into the inkwell
without anyone noticing.  Since I know that Ken was inking some
of these pages during the Motor City Comic Con, I'll be
charitable and blame it on his being distracted by gawkers likeme.
     
<p>Two pages of back story: nice artwork.  We get to see some
of the early players including Antoine's dad, Sonic's folks,
(presumably) a young Geoffrey and his dad, a VERY young Sally
(too cute), and...hmmm, Sonic must've been home with the sitter. 
And some Great War footage, which highlights the fact that the
Overlanders and the hedgehogs apparently went to the same barber. 
Maybe the War could have been avoided and history changed if the
King had abdicated and let the barber settle differences between
the two parties; have you ever known a barber who DIDN'T have the
answer to everything?  Kinda nice portrait of the Knothole gang,
except that Tails looks apprehensive.  One look at page 3 and
you'll understand why.  Time for a Reality Check, people:
hedgehogs aren't blue, ground squirrels don't wear vests, foxes
only have one tail...oops, wrong Reality.  The reality here is
that the old saying needs to be changed to: "To the victor
belongs the spoiled."  The double-page spread on 4 and 5 is a
great picture, but it ain't a pretty one.
     
<p>Sally puts up a brave front as she and the gang begin
scouting Robotnik's old HQ/her old home.  The group is suddenly
attacked by a Dynamac left over from "A Robot Rides The Rails." 
Extra credit to Ken for knowing that crossbows shoot "bolts"
instead of arrows.  While Sonic and Geoff learn that the direct
approach doesn't work on a Dynamac, it decides to take Antoine,
Bunnie, Tails, and Hershey for a spin.  Once again, Ken tries to
sell us on the "multiple imaging" bit, and includes an editorial
box that suggests that the readers "Shake your hand real fast and
see how many images you can make."  I knew kids back in my high
school who used to do this; of course, they'd do it just after
taking LSD.  Rotor manages to notice a pair of boots that happen
to be occupied by Snively, who's controlling the Dynamac.  While
Geoffrey stops the Sniveler by doing his Peter Parker impression,
Sonic sees to it that the Dynamac is distracted long enough for
Bunnie to electrocute the brute.  Glad Bunnie thought to check
her insulation.  When Sally expresses doubts as to whether the
Snivster will be cooperative he replies "You got THAT right,.
Sister!"  A little late to be auditioning for "The DiscoveryZone," isn't it?
     
<p>One quick anecdote: in my undergraduate days, I took part in
a College Bowl-type event.  During one round, the moderator read
the following: "Name the beetle with the large snout....", at
which point one of my teammates rang in.  Had the moderator
finished the question ("...that is a pest to cotton plants"),
things might have been different.  Instead my teammate blurted
out: "RINGO STARR!"  The game was stopped for a minute while
everyone busted a gut laughing.  I suppose that's what Ken was
going for with the "Ringo" crack on page 12.  The answer, BTW,was "boll weevil."
     
<p>Remember Sally's performance on page 6, putting up a brave
front talking about the mission?  It lasts until page 13 when she
looks around one of the rooms of what had been the palace; from
the trashed teddy at her feet in one panel, we're meant to think
it was her old room.  She then allows herself one of the luxuries
she couldn't afford as Leader and All-Around Pillar Of Strength
for the Knothole crowd: the chance to have a good cry.  Sonic's
response is typical for most males when confronted with a weepy
female: he leaves.  Back downstairs the testosterone is flowing
freely as Rotor begins tinkering with something mechanical and
Sonic and Geoffrey engage in "guytalk."  This is a variant of the
language where a lot of things are left unsaid.  This CAN make
for misunderstandings: the unstated phrase in the last panel of
the page could have been "in the bathroom" and it wouldn't have
made a difference.  That Sally could have used a shoulder to cry
on seems not to have occurred to these two.  The fight with
Robotnik may be over; the Battle of the Sexes never ends.
     
<p>And now: THE COUNTRIES OF MOBIUS!  And if you think I'm
gonna set this to music and sing it like Yakko Warner, forget it! 
We're obviously dealing with an Earth where the Eastern
Hemisphere has been scrunched together, Mexico got lost when
California fell into the sea (OK, you can stop applauding), and
someone pulled the plug on the oceans because a LOT less of the
surface is covered by water.  So after a careful analysis that
took a few minutes, combined with an atlas and some guesswork,
here's a Layman's Guide to What's Where:</center></center></center>
     
<blockquote>
<p>1. Walrus Island: scene of the "Tundra Road" story arc. 
Looks like it might have broken away from Canada.  Or am Ithinking of Quebec?
     <br>2. Frozen North Sea.  Yeah, I'll bet it is.
     <br>3. Floating Island.  See also #31.  Since it was supposed to
have been on a direct course for Knothole back in "Panic in the
Sky" (Sonic & Knuckles special), it would appear Knuckles managed
to alter its course before getting his own series.
     <br>4. "Area where Mobie was found": referring to "Blast From
The Past" (Sonic #32).  This puts Mobie well up in the Great
White North, which means that either the so-called "Mobian cave
bear" was the ancestor of the Mobian polar bear (to which he
bears NO resemblance), or else he was really a holdover from the
Canadian Football League.  To quote Mobie: "Arrrgh, grfmf, eh?"
     <br>5. Veg-O-Fortress: I got into Sonic comics a little late and
so never saw the VOF, as the "fortress" goes back to Sonic #6. 
But it would appear that it's located in or near Seattle.  A
stone's throw from a Starbuck's, no doubt.
     <br>6. West Robotropolis: Since it appears as if California took
a good chunk of Oregon with it when it fell into the sea (hey, I
SAID you could stop applauding!), West Robotropolis appears to be
comprised of what's left of the Cascade Range.
     <br>7. Railroad Line To West Coast: Runs between what appears to
have been Portland, OR and Mobotropolis (#13).
     <br>8. Devil's Gulag.  My first guess was Alcatraz Island, but
it's too close to the shore considering what happened to
California (OK, OK, applaud already!  Sheesh!).  Has to be
somewhere else.  Somewhere isolated, dark and foreboding. 
Somewhere that is a natural prison, where the very environment
can suck the life out of you.  I'm thinking Bakersfield.
     <br>9. Casino Night Zone.  Too far northeast to be Las Vegas. 
Looks like casino gambling was approved in Denver, Colorado. 
Either that or the Plains Indians managed to get a major piece of
the casino action.     
<br>10. Canyons: Featured in SonicQuest #1, where Sonic was 
looking for Carl Condor while Tails was back watching the sex
show in the Grotto.  Obviously pegged to the Grand Canyon.
     <br>11. Mobian Desert.  AKA the American southwest.
     <br>12. Flickie Island.  Looks like Maui swallowed up a coupleother islands.
     <br>13. Mobotropolis.  Considering how much of Texas got lost
along with Mexico (that's what we get for putting Ross Perot in
the White House), Mobotropolis seems to be located in the
Houston-San Antonio area.
     <br>14. Knothole:  Victim of a misplaced arrow.  Either that or
14 and 15 need to be switched.  Assuming that the river is the
Mississippi (a few meanderings notwithstanding), that would put
Knothole in the Ozarks.
     <br>15. The Great Forest: Either Arkansas or north Louisiana. 
Bunnie didn't have too far to travel.
     <br>16: Mobian Badlands: You ever been to Southern Illinois?
     <br>17: Robo-Hobo Jungle (Sonic #40): right around Atlanta. 
Does Ted Turner know?
     <br>18: Bottom of the Barrel Bar 'N' Grill: according to the
legend, the bar is over 100 miles (at least) from the Robo-Hobo
Jungle.  Talk about your zoning laws!
     <br>19: Overlander Territory: The Rust Belt and the Northeast.
     <br>20: Megacentral.  Too far inland to be New York City; looks
like Harrisburg or Baltimore.
     <br>21: Mobian Jungle (Sonic #45): Looks like it's theEverglades.
     <br>22: Marshlands: the Louisiana Bayous.
     <br>23: "Island Where Tails Met Fiona": refers to the ill-fated
"Growing Pains" arc.  Can't see it distinctly.  Could be one of
the Florida Keys or one of the other Caribbean islands.  Of
course, off the Florida Keys there's a place called Kokomo....
     <br>24: Skoal Island (Sonic #17): Probably all that remains of
Cancun and the Yucatan Peninsula.     25: Mysterious Cat Country: Brazil.
     <br>26: Kingdom of Mercia: You have to use your imagination, but
I picture it as Ireland after having been linked up with otherland masses.
     <br>27: Emerald Sea: The Irish Sea, of course.
     <br>28: Lethal Radioactive Zone: if not Chernobyl, then there's
a doozy of an accident waiting to happen in China.
     <br>29: Land Of A Million Lights: South Africa.  
     <br>30: Downunda: the part of Australia that didn't break away
and drift toward South America.
     <br>31: Flight Path of the Floating Island: self-explanatory.
     <br>32: Former Site of the Floating Island: ditto.
     <br>33: Tails' Trail to Downunda: ditto.
     
</blockquote>
<p><center>Also noteworthy: the body of water southwest of the Emerald
Sea appears to be what's left of the Mediterranean, the Amazon
River appears to have bisected South America, and the Japanese
archipelago looks like it's being swallowed up between Africa andChina.
     
<p>That's the end of the geography lesson, now back to our
story.  The following morning Sally starts delegating authority. 
After sending Sonic and Tails out on reconnaissance, she
discovers that Geoffrey is AWOL.  As it turns out, he's gone
behind her back.  He and his security minions have secured the
"armory" and are reporting this development to...King Acorn who
appears to be in isolation back in Knothole and who begins a rant
about "the enemy within", specifically Sonic's Uncle Chuck. 
Methinks the monarch is starting to grow crystals in his cranium.
     
<p>And what ABOUT Uncle Chuck, who seems to have made himself
scarce?  He's making his way underground where he relays news of
Robotnik's defeat to...
     
<p>OK, here's another memory from the Motor City Comic Con.  At
one point, Ken handed me a page that he was inking.  There's been
some rearrangement of the page elements since then, but I
recognize the third panel from page 19 as being on that page; it
was also only half-inked, and not all the dialogue balloons were
in place.  I wasn't sure of the significance of it all as I
handed it back to Ken who said: "Congratulations.  You're the
first one to get a look at Sonic's parents."  Try sitting on THAT
piece of news for six months!  Come to think of it, that's about
how long it's been since the angle of "What happened to Sonic's
Dad?" was quickly raised in #46 and dropped just as quickly. 
Anyway, Uncle Chuck then brings in the second half of the good
news-bad news routine: it doesn't look like it will be possible
to deroboticize anybody.  And considering the way that the
deroboticizing angle has been so badly mishandled in the past in
stories such as "Steel-Belted Sally" (#29), "The Day Robotropolis
Fell" (#27) and "Mecha Madness", perhaps it's just as well.
     
<p>Meanwhile. Sonic and Tails have come across some SWATbots
who appear to be on auto-pilot.  While checking things out, Tails
make reference to a story element from "The Return" (#22)...a
story set in a future Mobius where Sonic and Sally are married
with children and which has since been sort of renounced as being
only one future scenario among many.  But it's still a scenario
that Tails could have no way of knowing anything about.  In any
event, we don't linger on this major continuity gap as the
SWATbot angle itself disappears down the loose continuity hole
while Sonic and Tails respond to a call for help.  Seems as if
Arlo Aardvark has managed to get trapped under some debris.  He's
in such a bad way that he gives an inappropriate response to
Sonic's feeding him a straight line; the routine is supposed to
go: "Does it hurt?" "Only when I laugh."  Penelope Platypus is no
help -- she's too busy trying out that hand-waving thing Freddy
suggested thirteen pages back.  Sonic can't cut through the
concrete by spin-dashing it, so it's time for...a Deus Ex
Machina!  In this case, his name is Rudyard and he's a
roboticized Mobian who frees Arlo.
     
<p>Quick break for the Fan Art page: Carrol Scheeweiss submits
an anime-style Tails, Danielle Hardy sends in more anime-inspired
art, Erin Middendorrf submits a fan art envelope showing Knuckles
and Sally beneath the midnight sun, but the clear winner in the
uniqueness category is Jeff Streets' Lego(tm) Sonic.
     
<p>Back to the action: turns out Rudyard is the vanguard of a
group of roboticized Mobians being led by Uncle Chuck, including
Sonic's parents.  Sonic does NOT take this news well; honked off
at Uncle Chuck for not telling him, he does what he does best and
runs away.  Tails follows after.  This reaction turns out to be a
foretaste of what's to come; while Sally is ready to welcome
Uncle Chuck and the others with open arms, at least one other
member of the B Team has doubts.  It's pretty hard to find
anything like a Kodak moment here.
     
<p>Outside the city limits, Tails listens as Sonic vents. 
Tails then tries talking to Sonic in dialogue that...well,
there's something seriously OFF about it.  It makes sense but
begs for a rewrite.  And left unspoken is the account of HOW
Sonic's folks got that way.  Uncle Chuck or Sonic's 'rents
themselves will have to fill in that blank one of these issues.
     "Later that evening" (it says here), Sally is thinking
seriously of abandoning the site and making a fresh start
somewhere else.  Nicole hints at "unexplored options" but further
discussion of urban renewal also slips down the loose continuity
hole as we take about 4 pages to have a go at the Sonic-Sally-
Geoffrey jealousy bit.  Geoffrey tells Sally if she's looking for
a friend, "I'm just your MATE!"  Uh, are you using "mate" as a
noun or a verb, Geoff?  Sally replies with the old "let's just be
friends" line, indicating that she knows how she feels about
Sonic but wants to know where the blue bachelor stands.  Sonic
arrives and decks Geoffrey, which starts a full-scale fight.  The
male bonding gets so intense that Sally has to get Bunnie and
Antoine to literally hose them down.  Unlike "The Quiet Man"
where John Wayne and this other guy punch each other out all over
this quaint backlot Irish village and at the end of it all become
best buds, the fight settles nothing between Geoffrey and Sonic
who exchange insincerities.
     
<p>The pup tents on page 14 have grown up and turned into wall
tents on page 35--must've installed an upgrade during the day. 
Using Nicole as a communicator, Sally chats with her father and
reveals that she's been acting on his orders.  That's OK, since
he's still the legitimate ruler; the fact that he wants this kept
secret from everyone else disturbs Sally and leaves a bad taste
in MY mouth, too.  There's a saying in 12-step groups that
"You're only as sick as your secrets."  Considering all the
levels of secrecy at work (Geoffrey, Sally, the King, Uncle
Chuck), cleaning up after Robotnik may be the LEAST of their
problems.  When Sally asks Nicole for an independent analysis
she's basically told: "Deal with it."  So she's come home to find
the city a shambles, the populace divided, her love life
nonexistent, and her father acting irrationally.  Sort of like
Scarlett O'Hara having returned to Tara from Atlanta in "Gone
With The Wind" except that Sally lacks Scarlett's terminal
bitchiness.  I don't blame her for crying herself to sleep.  If
you don't want to crawl into that bottom panel and give that girl
a hug, check your pulse!
     
<p>And just when you thought things couldn't get any worse for
Sally, she wakes up to discover that the roboticized Mobians have
decided to separate themselves and start their own colony because
they feel they no longer belong.  Sally's plea that they remain
united because "You're our fathers and mothers, our family and
friends" falls on deaf ears...or deactivated sensors, as the case
may be.  Bunnie, symbolically enough, finds herself standing
between the robotic and biological factions; she may have a
future in the diplomatic service as an ombudsbunny.  So here's
where things stand: Sonic is upset at his Uncle Chuck, doesn't
appear to be able to relate to his parents, and has a continuing
grudge against Geoffrey, while Sally is having to cope with more
problems than she ever had to face as a high school
revolutionary.  The roboticized Mobians feel alienated, and the
King is manipulating both Geoffrey and his own daughter.  Seems
like the only Mobian who's having a good time at this point is
Rotor, who's just got the airport computer back online so we can
watch a transport ship leave the city for its weekly run to the
Devil's Gulag.  Great: the entire city is a dump and the
infrastructure is a shambles but the prison system is still
functioning--that's what you get for voting Republican.  Don't
ask me what that space-filling doodle is in the last panel on
page 37; it looks like something from a Franz Kline abstract
expressionist painting.  Either that or Robotnik began
roboticizing Mobians only after having tried crucifixion.  There
follows a one-page soliloquy by Snively, but does anyone in the
reading audience really give a rat's rump about HIM?

</p>

<p>Now THIS is the level of emotional involvement that Endgame
should have tried for and that somehow got lost in the "pursuit
of Sonic" plotline.  The story works and you get the feeling that
these characters (or at least some of them) have something like a
complex emotional life and that they're not just reading lines
and going through the motions.  These vistas have always been
waiting to be opened up by the Archie staff.  Unfortunately, due
to circumstances quite beyond their control in some respects,
Archie continues to hedge its bets and sabotage its best efforts.
     
<p>Perhaps the most egregious example can be seen on page 29 in
the bottom panel.  As reported by Alessandro Sanasi in his
review, Sonic looks...different...in that panel because on orders
from Sega (which thought that the Sonic drawn by Ken Penders
looked "too depressed"), Pat Spaziante redrew Sonic so that IMHO
he simply looks tired.  A short art history lesson: Michelangelo
not only painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, but did a
fresco on the wall behind the altar depicting "The Last
Judgment."  Many years after its completion, Pope Paul V (in the
name of "reforming Roman morals," according to one writer) had
the nude figures in the fresco "draped" by having other artists
come in and paint over the genitalia of the figures.  Once again,
Sega has played Pope Paul V to Ken Penders' Michelangelo.  It
appears that the Sonic characters can only show as much emotion
as Sega's Vice President In Charge Of Making Sure That Sonic Acts
Cool will allow.
     
<p>And he has to show the RIGHT emotion.  That means that Sally
gets to have a good cry but Sonic can't.  Whether it's being
confronted with Sally's body or discovering that his real father
is still alive and that his surrogate father (Uncle Chuck) has
been lying to him for years, there are always going to be at
least two dry eyes in the house.  Sexist?  Of course, it is! 
"Big boys don't cry" must be the in-house motto at Archie, where
the likes of Archie, Reggie, Betty, and Veronica haven't exactly
been positioned as icons of male sensitivity or feminism.  Archie
Comics may, by its very editorial nature, be incapable of dealing
with emotions beyond the level on display here, and frankly we'd
better just get used to that fact.  You want anything more
honest, I can recommend a lot of decent fanfic out there.
     
<p>What Archie CAN do is throw fight scenes at us.  While the
business with the Dynamac was good if a little long, the latest
Sonic-Geoffrey scrap demonstrates that this angle is not only
tired but has gotten to be unintentionally funny.  Geoffrey's
overuse of the word "mate" fails to approximate an Aussie accent
and begins to underscore its double meaning for a furry.  But in
THIS story Ken has pushed the accidental humor into new
territory.  Not only do you have the overuse of "mate" and
Sonic's sarcastic use of "luv" in addressing Geoffrey, we also
have Geoff yelling "Let's have a go...!" while Hershey describes
the two of them as "going at it like crazed pumas."  This reminds
me of the phrase "going at it like crazed voles" as used in the
"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" episode titled something like
"Looking For Parmah In All The Wrong Places".  When Antoine and
Bunnie finally have to "hose them down", it would appear that the
next plot twist Ken plans to spring on us is that Sonic and
Geoffrey will admit that they're really gay lovers.
     
<p>Ken has admitted online that thinking up names for the
characters is one of the hardest parts of the job.  That is the
only explanation that will allow me to forgive him for the names
foisted on Sonic's parents, "Jules" and "Bernie."  Not only is
this too close to "Jules" and "Verne" (the names of Doc Brown's
two sons in "Back To The Future 3"), but I've NEVER heard
"Bernie" used as a short form for "Berneice" (which I presume was
the full name for Sonic's mom).  And having seen them in sketch
form at Motown, I have to say that they looked more impressive in
pencil.  Barry Grossman's coloring of the roboticized Mobians is
too jarring.  Maybe I'm just too used to the more muted spectrum
used in the cartoon where roboticized Mobians were gray or silver
or slate or gun metal blue.
     
<p>For all that, however, I'm just about ready to take back
many of my reservations about a post-Knothole Sonic.  This is the
strongest level of narrative I've seen in a while, and Ken's work
here begins to approach the level of his recent Knuckles work. 
I'm still not reconciled to the idea of "loose continuity" where
a plot line or a story element is raised and then goes
unaddressed for months on end, as opposed to a touch of
foreshadowing of something that will happen in the next issue. 
But so long as the other writers on the Sonic team don't drop the
ball, we may actually have something decent to look forward to.
