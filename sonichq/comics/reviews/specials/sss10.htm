          is my review of SSS#10: Crossover Chaos. *sigh* After the great quality 
          of Sonic Kids 2, they give us this... Okay... time to make the donuts...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First off: Some 
          Enchantra Evening: Chapter 2. Okay... Let's keep the resume short: This 
          one bad witch, Enchantra, gets pissed at Sabrina, who misspelled her 
          name or something, and plots vengance, instead of doing like rationnal 
          mortals and sueing her. She scans the dimensions and finds Mobius. She 
          zaps Sonic, turning him into a "Yes, Master" zombie, and sics him at 
          Sabrina. Sally uses Nicole to follow Sonic to Earth, through a dimensionnal 
          hole left by Enchantra, and joins up with Sabrina to try and stop Sonic 
          from wrecking her town.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sabrina keeps Sonic 
          busy until his mind is freed, and Sally faces off with Enchantra to 
          convince her to send everyone back, or else she'll tell every Sonicverse 
          villain about that Dimensionnal hole. If I had been Sally, I would've 
          done it anyway. Hey, let some other universe handle them for once! So, 
          before Sonic can go medeival on Enchantra for brain-washing him, Enchantra 
          sends all the Mobians back home, with no memory of what happened. Good 
          idea, Enchantra! Now, could you help us forget this horrid story happened?</font></p>
                
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rating: 
          ZERO RINGS !!! - Archie CAN do better than this...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          story, both chapters of it, was pretty lame. Aside from the clichèd 
          "Fight then team-up" routine (Already lame in its own right), we had 
          bad puns, cheap action sequences and low character development. Essentially, 
          this was just a gratuitous crossover. If the guys at Archie had kept 
          it all in the Sabrina comics, I would've been greatful. On the art, 
          it shows Dave Manak has been away for a long time. Sonic's head looked 
          as big as a beach ball, and he looked like he was going to bust a gut 
          half the time. I just hope Dave practices a bit more if he ever intends 
          on doing the Sonic books again.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Zone 
          Wars - &quot;A Tale Of Two Hedgehogs..."</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, 
          for the second story: Zone Wars: A tale of Two Hedgehogs. Remember, 
          in SSS#8, I told you the prologue meant we'd see more of this stuff? 
          Here it is. Okay... Let's keep the resume short. Okay, from the Reverse 
          Universe, Evil Sonic gets diched by the Evil FFs after a failed attack 
          on Dr Kintobor's (previously referred to as good Dr Robotnik) clinic. 
          He then gets contacted by an unknown stranger (but those of us who've 
          read S#74 know it's obviously Robotnik) to do a job for him. That job 
          is retrieving all the pieces of the Giant-Borg Battle-suit from Sonic 
          #19, which were scattered through the mega-verse by all the Sonics.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zonic, 
          the side-ways Sonic counterpart/zonecop from SSS#8, recruits, as he 
          says he always does, Sonic the Hedgehog (our own) and goes with him, 
          via the No-Zone, Zonic's home, to Sonic Underground Mobius. There, our 
          hero meets his counterpart from the new, hotly debated cartoon show, 
          trade origins, and start to plan what to do. Meanwhile, Evil Sonic mixes-up 
          his Robotniks and gives the Giant Borg pieces to the SU Robotnik, leaving 
          the real Robotnik to make other plans. When SU Robotnik goes wild on 
          Robotropolis with his new toy (you'd think he'd be more careful around 
          his own town), Archie Sonic and SU Sonic (who has the worst hair cut 
          I've seen so far) double-team to stop him, destroying the battle-suit. 
          Meanwhile, Manic (with worst name) and Sonia (who sounds like Urkel's 
          sister), disguised as aristocrats in robe (Dingo and Sleet must really 
          be stupid to fall for that), break Evil Sonic out of SU Robotnik's dungeon, 
          so Zonic can arrest him, and then everyone goes home.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okay. 
          What can I say about this story? Well, aside from the pleasent reappearence 
          of Evil-Sonic (I love the guy), this story was clearly just a way for 
          Archie to introduce us to the up-coming Sonic Underground TV series. 
          The concept seems fascinating, but I hate that Sega is just dumping 
          the SatAM plotline for this show. What? Sonic couldn't do the SU thing 
          in the SatAM world? The art was good, and the story was pretty nice, 
          even though they didn't do a good job of hiding the "Mystery Man's" 
          identity. I guess they expected S#74 to be out already. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
          nothing changes the fact this story was just a gimmick to introduce 
          Sonic readers to Sonic Underground.</font></p>
