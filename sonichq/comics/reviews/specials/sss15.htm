          review:<br>
          Worst Comic Ever.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">...What, you want more details? 
          Oh, ok...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">This comic has two "stories", 
          if you feel generous.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">First one:<br>
          <b>&quot;Naugus Games&quot;</b><br>
          Written by Ken Penders<br>
          Pencil and Inks by Many Hands</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, long (and dull) story 
          short, Sonic goes to the Southern Tundra to pay his last respects to 
          Eddy the Snowborg. Already this story starts on a lousy note with an 
          implausible premise: Wouldn't have Sonic ALREADY done that before leaving 
          the place with Nate in the first place? ...Besides, Sonic barely knew 
          the big guy, so why the pilgrimage? I guess Ken needed an excuse for 
          the rest of this "Story"...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Sonic goes to the ruins, and 
          falls down a whole, and then we spend the next 2 and 1/2 pages with 
          the cheapest "Save on Artwork" plan ever designed: Deep, dark cavern 
          with us only seeing the eyes of the character trapped there. This, folks, 
          is a new low of Archie comics...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Sonic eventually DOES find 
          a bright spot in the cavern (that is, a place with actual light), and 
          he finds all the Golden Rings that were somehow left behind when Naugus 
          got kicked back into the Zone of Silence. (Well, Ken calls it the Forbidden 
          Zone, showing some poor continuity here, but that's practically minor 
          compared to what follows...)</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Sonic figures out that he 
          just needs to touch the rings and wish to get out of that hole (Showing 
          us yet another way of using the Power Rings... I wish Archie would stay 
          consistant here.), but when he touches them, the image of Naugus fills 
          his mind and Sonic somehow accidentally wishes for Naugus to appear. 
          We get a short "Pulled out of wazoo" explanation about Naugus' reappearance 
          (You don't want to know anyways), then we skip straight to the fight, 
          which has the typical "Tries to shoot and misses the guy moving at super-speeds, 
          until Naugus starts a snowstorm, sending us into Cheapskate art-saving 
          trick Number 2: the Blank Panel...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">The rest of the fight lasts 
          for 6 panels of pure white scenery, but since we can see it, who cares?</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">It ends with Sonic pulling 
          out a Power Ring out of nowhere, dissapating the snow and shipping Naugus 
          back to the Zone of Silence, via Deus Ex Machina shipping... We then 
          end with a pointless tribute to Eddy, who had absolutly zip to do with 
          this story.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Rating: Zero Rings.</b> 
          ...In fact, I rate this story a full Negative 5 Rings! That's how bad 
          it is!</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Comments: If you ask me for 
          more than I provided in the review, We'd be here all month... Move along!</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Sonic Spin City&quot;</b><br>
          Written and Penciled by Michael Gallagher (ain't he off this book yet?)</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, to make this even short, 
          this story is a terrible attempt at parodying a "Mature Audiences" comic 
          book, Sin City by Frank Miller, which features art done mostly through 
          inking by shading black and white on a page. It also has content that 
          are more or less incompatible with ANYTHING by Archie comics, so Gallagher 
          choice of making such a story makes no sense to me.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">In fact, I'll skip straight 
          to the rating: <b>Zero Rings</b> again.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Overall Rating: Zero Rings.</b> 
          This book stank.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">You want my final comments 
          on this book? It's a piece of @#$#, that's what it is, and I think it 
          stinks... The Sonic Super Specials were one of my favorite monthly moments, 
          and Archie has systematically begun making them lousy issue after issue, 
          ever since this whole "Zone Wars" mess got started. The Sonic Specials 
          used to be showcases of imaginative stories and a chance for writers/artists 
          to do innovative stuff, like the Sonic Kids special or the #50 director's 
          cut...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">...But this... this is lousy. 
          And the worst part, is that Ken Penders has shown he can do better, 
          much better then this. "Worst of Times" is an example of Penders' good 
          work, for one. But this... It's like Ken just thought up a storyline 
          while sitting on the toilet and wrote it down, deciding it would be 
          the final SSS script.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ken Penders, I want my 2.99$ 
          Can. Back, darnit!!</font>
