<center><p><b><p><center>Before we get started........we wont even do a review for this issue. WHY? Various fans have had thier say already on this issue - All positive except for one lone person who will remain nameless - Those of the Sonic Mailing List know who - But thats not the point, The point is Sonic 50 was everything that Endgame should have been. Not only that - It was a very special issue ---- Why....Just read from one of our own - Taken verbatim......</p></b></center>

<p>For those of you who couldn't make it last night to the chat party, here's the big secret, and don't be afraid to respond.<BR><BR>Well, you all remember my reaction to the big kiss in the director's cut. (Look on the News Page if you haven't seen it.) I was screaming for joy in the car in happiness.<BR><BR>Well, on the way home from the comic store Wednesday, out of a fortunate twist of events, my girlfriend Andrea Vargo beeped me. Knowing that this was a great coincidence, I immediately went there. I showed her the whole thing, and she was just as happy and excited as I was.<BR><BR>It was then that I realized. That picture of Sonic & Sally's kiss held a great meaning within me. Within that picture & that kiss, I saw everything that it stood for and portrayed. It was pure, cute, gentle, beautiful, and full of all emotion that is good. In noticing that, I realized that I saw the same things in Andrea. I knew right then that it was the perfect time.<BR><BR>Perfect time for what, you ask?<BR><BR>I got down on one knee and proposed marriage to her.<BR><BR>Her response, and I quote: Yes. Yes. With all my heart, yes.<BR><BR>That's right! I am now engaged to be married. Granted, the engagment is unofficial and our secret until I get the ring (Phooey!), and the actual marriage won't be for a few years (College first. I'm only 20, she's 19.), but I knew right then that I had to ask. There was no more perfect time, and I didn't want to lose that moment.<BR><BR>So what do you guys think? Come share in my happiness over this magical event.<BR><BR>

<b><p><center>To Brian Sapinski - Associate, Friend, and overall good guy - We congratulate you. May you and your days with Andrea be forever encased in happiness.
