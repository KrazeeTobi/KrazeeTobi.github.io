<p><b>Cover: Look! It's Flubber! No, seriously, it's Mammoth 
Mogul doing a David Copperfield trick with his cane. Then there
come Super Sonic and Hyper Knuckles. All in all, this cover is 
excellently drawn and colored. I wonder why Tails wasn't on the
cover...no more room for one more "hero"?
       
<p>Text Page (formerly known as the Splash Page): I can't 
believe it, but I actually read the text! The text stated what
happened in Knuckles #9, Mogul used the Sword of Acorns to absorb
all of Enerjak's chaos energy and now holds the energy of 12 chaos
emeralds inside him. The art was by Sam Maxwell, not bad, looking
forward to his penciling in Sonic Super Special #4: Return of the King.

<p>You know, for a first time Sonic artist, John Hebert 
isn't that bad. In fact his pretty good, but he's overshadowed 
by Manny Galan's art at the end. Patrick Spaziante also drew a few
here and there.
       
<p>Page1-3: The story start out with this..."Agh! your spines are
jabbing my head!" "Ugh! Big deal! Your claws are jabbing my spine!"
"Yecch! Both of you get your dirty feet outta my face!"...and we 
get a pan down view of Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails stranded on an 
asteroid in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly the rock became alive and
trapped Sonic, he tried his drill move which left Knuckles and
Tails adrift. Then the "ol'weirdo" Athair showed up and helped the 
three out of the zone.
       
<p>Page4-11: We jump back to Echidnapolis and witness the all
powerful Mogul whip the Freedom Fighters, the echidna security team,
and the dingoes. Then out of nowhere came Sonic and Knuckles with
50 power rings each. Mogul zapped them with chaos energy, but instead
of leaving the mortal plane, they turned into...SUPER SONIC and
HYPER KNUCKLES. A BIG battle unfolded, Mogul somehow created a
Floating Island quake and was about to jump on Sonic and Knuckleswhen...
       
<p>Page12-16: A phantom stranger showed up, Mogul beamed the
stranger some chaos energy and...
       
<p>Now we stop for fan art and name page. Man, there sure are 
a lot of Sonic artists out there. Tony Nguyen's Freedom Fighters
and Katie Williamson's Lupe are both very good drawings.
       
<p>...the stranger turned into TURBO TAILS. Now wait a minute,
Turbo Tails? How did this name slip by the Sega watchdogs? I mean
shouldn't it be Super Tails like in the games. Oh well, Mogul
revealed that Tails is THE CHOSEN ONE, and is going to be one of
this era's greatest champions along with Sonic and Knuckles. Now
wait a minute again, how come Tails is the Chosen One and not Sonic?!?
Isn't the name of this comic Sonic The Hedgehog and not Tails the Fox!
Anyway, Mogul decided it's time for more power, so he blasted his way
toward the Chaos Chamber. All the while, Locke and his dad watched
from Haven deciding when to interfere.
       
<p>Page17-18: Mogul got to the chamber an went for the two emeralds
that's there. Just as he was about to touch the emeralds, Locke and
his father interfered and created a explosion. Now there's one huge
Master Emerald in the chamber with Mogul trapped in it.
       
<p>Page19-22: Down settled over the once magnificent city of
Echidnapolis which now looks like the former Robotropolis. The
echidnas and Freedom Fighters had a meeting and decided that the out 
side forces' interference helped them win the battle. Then Sir Knuckles
handed the real Sword of Acorns over to Princess Sally. Later Sonic
and Knuckles had a talk. Sonic asked Knuckles to join him on his
upcoming adventures, Knuckles declined saying his place is on the
Floating Island. Well, Sonic then asked Tails, and he agreed happily.
So up for some Sonic solo adventures?

<p>After reading this issue, I was a little depressed. I'm not
so sure which way the comic is headed anymore. Its a bit of a mixed bag. Mammoth Mogul is 
TOO WORDY. You couldn't read the book without a thesaurus! On the other hand we finally get 
a plotline closed - namely the Sword Of Acorns. Its about time. Would the people at
Archie Comics break off Tails from Sonic and make a comic of his own?
Who's the hooded hedgehog on the cover of #58 and Knuckles #12? Is
Sonic ever going to rejoin the Freedom Fighters? Many questions are 
raised here, I'm sure the answers will pop up sometime in the future.
But for right now, this story was WAY too wordy and just kinda flubbed. 
Sad thing too - especially since it was the return of Super Sonic.


<p>Sonic-Grams: SSS#4: Return of the King is shipping on January 7,
it should be a very good issue. 
Also there's some info about the next issue, Art Mawhinney will pencil
it, should be a look-back issue. And Knuckles #10 will ship December
31...a little early, eh.
