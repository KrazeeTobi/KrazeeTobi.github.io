        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2"><b><font size="+1">I</font></b>t's 
          a real crime the way Sonic and Co. have gotten treated by their own 
          creators, and... Oh, it refers to -Sonic's- Crime! ...Never mind, my 
          original statement stands... Especially since this issue is full of 
          painfully obvious errors in plot managment and characterisation.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We start this issue's first 
          story in the Great Forest, where Sonic is bemoaning the fact it's his 
          fault King Max got cold-cocked back in Robotropolis, about his failure 
          to use the Sword of Acorns to find a way to free his Uncle Chuck, and 
          about losing the Sword of Acorns along the way. Ok, now there's mistake 
          number one right there.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">SONIC DOES NOT WHINE! Failure 
          or no failure, the Sonic I know would never just give up without a fight, 
          and would redouble his efforts at fixing his mistakes. Heck, the Sonic 
          I know would never have come back to Knothole without the Sword in the 
          first place!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">But anyways, Sonic is brooding 
          his way through the Great Oak Slide, when he gets stopped at the end 
          by a net, placed there by the Secret Service, which promptly arrests 
          him! (Wait, since when is the Secret Service the Secret Police now? 
          I guess Elias is letting his power get to him...) Sonic decides to resist 
          arrest, saying he doesn't answer to St John. That's when Elias steps 
          in and tries to put his foot down as the new guy in charge.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Meanwhile, in Robotropolis, 
          the Overlanders are slowly being marched into town with an Ominous Shadowbot 
          escort, with little girl Hope and her Grandma not feeling so secure, 
          despite Colin's assurances that it's better then being attacked by Furries. 
          The Hologram of Doc Robotnik shows up and assures everyone that his 
          city is perfectly safe and secure, and don't mind the looks (or the 
          smells). In fact, he offers Colin a luxury suite at his Palace!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, now this is Error #2: 
          Back in Sonic #72, we learn that Robotnik originally escaped from Overlander 
          territory, rather then suffering a 10 year imprisonnment for Illegal 
          Experiments, sentanced by Colin himself! And then he went to work for 
          the Furries, selling military secrets and advice! And now COLIN ACTUALLY 
          TRUSTS HIM? Bollers is actually contradicting HIMSELF! How bad is that?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Meanwhile, underneath Robotropolis 
          itself, Kodos is doing the classic villainous rant about how, with the 
          Sword of Acorns, he's now undefeatable and doesn't need anyone. Ho hum, 
          let's move on.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Sonic is 
          looking for Sally, but Elias insists that whatever he needs to tell 
          her can be told to him instead. Considering that Sonic's intentions 
          involve trying to act all lovey-dovey and begging for her forgiveness, 
          that's out of the question and Sonic storms off, leaving an indignant 
          St John, held back from lashing out by Elias.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Sonic just walks off, thinking 
          about how he messed everything up, when all of a sudden, Mina shows 
          up, sees Sonic and runs towards him at Super-Speed, and collides head-on, 
          not having mastered super-breaking yet. Sonic and Mina, then dazed on 
          the ground, just recover and laugh at the situation, then look at each 
          other in a sickeningly cute way... And then Sally arrives, sees Sonic 
          flirting with another girl and smashes him over the head with a large 
          hammer, yelling out "Sonic No Baka!"</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">...No, not really. But it 
          would've been more entertaining then them simply getting interrupted 
          in their "cutey" eye lock by Antoine, Bunny and General D'Coolette, 
          freshly arrived from Mercia. Heck, Sonic didn't even know they were 
          gone (geez, how long was that trip, anyways? It's barely been days since 
          the big battle where they left in the first place.) Antoine needs to 
          speak St-John and King Max at once, but as they soon learn from Nate 
          "Plot Device" Morgan (who arrives just in time to further the plot), 
          King Max has been left Paraplegic from his insuries, and handed down 
          his authority to Elias (the guy who never wanted the job in the first 
          place). And once more, Sonic goes into "Sulk Mode", moaning "All my 
          fault..." like a cry-baby, explaining everything he's done wrong. ...Again. 
          See a pattern forming? Just as Nate tries to reassure Sonic, explaining 
          Max never should've lead that mission in the first place, Sonic just 
          runs off, saying he needs to go where he needs to be. Ok, more on that 
          later.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Kodos' lair, Uma Arachnis, 
          apparantly concerned about losing her job do to a sword, swipes the 
          Sword of Acorns right from under Kodos' sleeping nose, and starts to 
          study it intently. O-k...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Sally gets 
          from Elias and St-John the news on Sonic's deed, and the fact he gave 
          no explanations. (She probably didn't get the part about Sonic looking 
          for her, though.) Sally starts out asking what she should do, but corrects 
          herself and asks Elias what he'll do about it. Queen Alicia reassures 
          her that her brother, with St-John's help, will handle the situation, 
          and that she should help her mother find something decent to wear. (Amazing... 
          Back inside that tube, she changed dresses from issue to issue, but 
          now she's spent three issues out of it, and hasn't changed clothes once.) 
          St-John agrees with the queen, stating it'll give him the opportunity 
          to council the prince.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Then, after the womenfolk 
          have left, St John turns to Elias, and states the obious: Elias ain't 
          no leader. (Well DUHH!) He then explains even more of the obvious, stating 
          that Elias never expected to become Prince, and that Max should've appointed 
          Sally his successor, despite being stuck in his old ways (In other words, 
          Max is a sexist). He then makes an ominous offer: He'll become the power 
          behind the throne, helping Elias to make his tough decisions so Max 
          won't be disappointed. And, showing once more that he sucks at making 
          good decisions, Elias accepts.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">(And what have we learned 
          from this, kids? 1: Sexism is a bad idea, 2: appointing someone to a 
          position out of nepotism instead of actual skills always brings trouble, 
          and 3: Geoffery St John is a fink!)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Robotropolis, Colin, 
          along with the little girl and grandma from earlier, finally meet Robotnik, 
          who seems delighted to see them. Colin offers a handshake, but Robotnik 
          refuses, due to germs. Colin seems surprised at Robotnik's sudden worry 
          about germs (Totally ignoring the fact that this Robotnik looks almost 
          NOTHING like the old one), but simply introduces his companions: Lady 
          Agnes and Hope. He remarried after Snively's mom died, but his second 
          wife didn't survive the Star Trip. Agnes is his mother-in-law, and Hope 
          his stepdaughter. and after they all find out how much of a villain 
          Robotnik is, I'm sure both of them will never let Colin forget it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Sonic races 
          all the way to Elias and Geoffery St John, apologizing for his behavior, 
          admitting his deed, and stating that he's ready to face the consequences 
          for his crimes. But rather then getting imprisoned, Elias simply strips 
          Sonic of his knighthood, and confines him to Knothole's borders! And 
          meanwhile, Geoffery is standing behind Elias, smiling wickedly. (BOOOOOOHHH!!)</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">With Fry's return, the quality 
          of the comic's art has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, the best 
          art in the world won't do much to save a lousy story, and this is one. 
          For one thing, Karl Bollers continues to dig his own grave by insisting 
          on making Sonic a whiner who moans about his mistakes rather then a 
          hero who strives to correct his mistakes at great personal cost, and 
          quite frankly, I think all the Sonic fans are getting tired of it. Lord 
          knows I am.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Secondly, the feud between 
          Julian and Colin was clearly established by BOLLERS HIMSELF in Sonic 
          #72, showing that Colin neither trusts nor likes his own brother, having 
          condemned him to prison for illegal experiments with the Universal Anhilator, 
          and then saw his own brother become the chief advisor to King Acorn 
          during the Great War, leading the furries to victory against his own 
          people. And now, Colin simply accepts Robotnik's offer of asylum, without 
          even suspecting his brother of foul play? If Bollers was continuing 
          someone else's story, this would already be a bad idea, but he HIMSELF 
          established that feud in #72. This, people, is bad writing even by the 
          standards of Star Trek Voyager's writing staff.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Thirdly, I don't mind the 
          "Elias gets the throne and St John gets the power behind it" subplot, 
          except for how Sally seems to have lost her backbone entirely. She's 
          not only given what little authority she still had, she's just given 
          up trying to keep in control of the situation! The Sally I knew would've 
          excused herself from helping her mother find a dress and offered Elias 
          HER assistance in making command decisions. Heck, I'm sure Elias should 
          normally have asked for HER help instead of St John's. That would be 
          the sensible decision for anyone in his position.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Yep, once more, Karl Bollers 
          has twisted the characters around just for the sake of fitting them 
          all into his funked-up story, throwing common sense and continuity to 
          the wind in the process. In fact, the Mina/Sonic love interest bit barely 
          even registers as a problem anymore, what with Sonic, Sally and company 
          all being written out of character like they are. So far, Bollers is 
          striking out issue after issue. If I was the editor, I'd be telling 
          him to shape up or get shaped out. Oh well, I'm giving him one more 
          chance. But if Sonic's not telling St John and Elias to stuff that knighthood 
          where the sun don't shine, and announcing that no-one's keeping him 
          cooped up in Knothole, then I'll officially declare this book unsalvageable.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">And now, the Knuckles Story.<br>
          </font><font face="arial" size="2"> <b>&quot;Bagging the Big One&quot; 
          <br>
          <br>
          </b></font><font face="arial" size="2"> Ken Penders: Writer, Penciller, 
          Inker, etc etc etc... <br>
          (In other words, he's the only one to blame here)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We finally pick up where #91's 
          back-up "story" left off, and we find Charmy and his fiancee Saffron 
          doing what all newly engaged couples do: the girl talks about how many 
          children they'll have while the guy is stuck hearing about it, probably 
          wondering how he can chew his own arm off to escape. I'm also pretty 
          sure Saffron will reconsider the number of children she'll want after 
          giving birth to the first one.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Before they can continue with 
          this sweet (and somewhat pathetic) scene, Knuckles teleports in from 
          a wormzone and meets up with Charmy and Saffron. Charmy is surprised 
          to discover Knuckles is now glowing green, while Knuckles is surprised 
          to discover Charmy is much bigger then he normally is (We found that 
          out back in the Knuckles book, around Issue #11 or 12, I think). Then 
          they proceed with a little "Catching up", while Nack and Nic are spying 
          on them from nearby, having used deduction (and "Well, Duh" reasoning) 
          to figure out that Knuckles, now alone, would try to find his only remaining 
          free friend, Charmy. (NM the fact that Sally is a closer friend then 
          Charmy, and that she would've been easier to find)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Before Nic can use her sniper 
          rifle to attack Knuckles, Nack stops her, reminding her that it's not 
          likely to do much on him. Instead, he decides to play it subtle, and 
          goes in for a closer look... Meanwhile, Knuckles is trying to bring 
          Charmy and Saffron up to speed with recent events, except he seems to 
          suffer from slight amnesia: the only things he remembers about what 
          happened on the Floating Island was fighting the Dark Legion, then winding 
          up floating on the water, all alone. Before he can explain the green 
          glow, Nack shows up and asks for a little help with his Sky Master (Saffron 
          first displays her now obvious cluelessness by thinking he's talking 
          about a critter, not a ship.)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Knuckles, despite having met 
          the Weasel in the Triple Threat adaptation, apparently doesn't recognize 
          Nack, and offers to help, but in time. Unfortunately, Nack doesn't give 
          him a choice in coming with him, throwing his knife between Knuckles' 
          feet. (Saffron makes her second display of cluelessness by stating "SAAAY! 
          That isn't nice!" Well Duh, Saffron!) Nack doesn't seem to leave Knuckles 
          with ANY choice, when he reveals his sister has Saffron and Charmy in 
          the sights of her Sniper rifle (Personally, I'd just let her shoot: 
          Get rid of Saffron, and put Charmy out of his misery, knowwhatImean?)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Knuckles, probably desperate 
          to get out of the neighborhood before being talked into being the best 
          man, agrees to follow Nack to his ship, where they find Yanar (with 
          Nack and Nic's payment and instructions to forget everything) and Gala-Na 
          (and a bunch of Echidna Storm-Troopers) Gala-Na tells the indignant 
          Knuckles that he wields more power then he can control, and that the 
          best thing to do before he becomes a danger to everyone, is to use the 
          Chaos Syphon on him, and may Aurora herself have mercy on his soul.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">To be continued.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, first off, am I the only 
          one here who thinks that Ken Penders' art leaves somewhat to be desired? 
          His art is both flat and lifeless, especially when compared to the art 
          of other Archie artists. I can draw pics about that well, and I'm a 
          hack sketching artist...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">The story wasn't too bad, 
          and actually does a little work to further the plot of Knuckles and 
          his current fate. Except it's not much of a plot in the first place, 
          is it? After four or five issues, we're still no closer to seeing Knuckles 
          confront the Dark Legion and free his friends and family somehow. We're 
          no closer to seeing Knuckles even do something about the situation! 
          Ken Penders really need to take his fingers out of his derrière and 
          do something to further the plot.</font></p>
