        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="+1">W</font></b>ell, 
          we continue this issue right where last Issue left off, with Sonic with 
          the Sword of Acorns running in the woods around Knothole, where he finds 
          out the mysterious figure following him last issue was none other then 
          Mina! Seems she's intent on facing off Robotnik and asking the evil 
          Doctor why he took away her family, and see what he says... (Personally, 
          I'm disappointed Sonic didn't use a sarcastic line like "Gee... Why 
          didn't I think of that tactic?") Before Sonic can respond (Indeed, she's 
          not giving him a chance, soon noticing that Sonic's got the Sword of 
          Acorns), a squad of Combots uncloak around our Hero and Mina and attack 
          them.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          back in Robotropolis, Dr Robotnik is pleased to see his Com-Bots found 
          the Sword of Acorns, and in the hands of Sonic, no less. Before we leave 
          him, he muses about how the Sword of Acorns seems to be able to restore 
          Robians to their free will. ...Like we all haven't figured that out 
          two issues ago...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          back in Knothole, the Royal Family reunion goes well, until King Max 
          notices, while trying to get up, that he can't feel his legs... More 
          on this later.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          go back to Sonic, who's trying to protect Mina from the Combots, but 
          seems to get the odds against him: As soon as his back is turned, a 
          Combot uncloaks behind Mina and seizes her, then another Combot uses 
          a magnetic tractor beam to grab the sword right out of Sonic's hands. 
          After a second to ponder his options, he knows he needs the Sword of 
          Acorn to rescue his Uncle Chuck and his dog Muttski, and that Mina is 
          practically begging to get Roboticized. Nonetheless, he chooses to rescue 
          her instead of grabbing the sword, but as soon as he lands on the ground 
          with her after kicking apart the Combot, he gets conked from behind 
          by a cloaked combot, leaving Mina to try and wake him up as the Combots 
          uncloak to approach them. Mina picks up Sonic and tries to run away... 
          and suddenly finds out she's running at Super-Speed!</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
          in Knothole, Geoffery's been called to the King's bedside, just as Max 
          tells Elias he's being appointed acting Head of State while the queen 
          is adjusting and until he himself gets better. Sorry Elias, looks like 
          you're saddled with the job of running the kingdom after all. But before 
          the King can tell Geoffery anything, the Skunk tells everyone that the 
          Sword of Acorn's been stolen. We just know he'll find a way to twist 
          this so Sonic's actions look worst then they are, don't we folks?</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          Dr R is partying about how he's gotten the Sword of Acorns, when suddenly 
          his computer informs him about two unidentified flying objects hovering 
          over Mobius, and aiming to fall on Robotropolis. Thinking they're Meteors, 
          Robotnik immediatly recalls his Combots, leaving Mina to tell a recovering 
          Sonic that the Sword is lost. Sonic doesn't take too kindly to defeat, 
          and immediatly rushes to try and intercept the robots before they arrive 
          at their base. He does manage to tackle the Combot carrying the sword 
          before it enters Robotropolis, but not before a Force-Field comes down, 
          cutting the robot in half, leaving Sonic on the outside and the Sword 
          on the inside... And just as Sonic threatens the Dr, he seems the Meteors 
          coming down overhead...</font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this was a good story, and I'm sure we're all aware that this means 
          there's going to be some massive changes in store for our heroes. King 
          Max is handicapped (Forgive me: Physically Challenged), Elias is the 
          new acting King, Sonic will probably get another stain on his record 
          for the Sword of Acorns thing, the "Meteors" which I'm sure devoted 
          readers will remember may actually be the starships from before the 
          Sonic Adventure adaptation, and the Sonic/Mina situation.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's 
          been noticed by many fans (like myself) that Archie comics may have 
          been planning to hook Sonic up with someone else then Sally, most likely 
          Mina. And admittingly, Mina now seems to have more in common with Sonic 
          then Sally does... Lost familys, independent spirit, and now Super-Speed... 
          gee, guys, why not make her a female Hedgehog, while we're at it? Nonetheless, 
          I'll try not to condemn this budding friendship until we see Sally's 
          reaction to it...</font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          pick up where last issue's cliffhanger left off, with Gala-Na leading 
          and emergency team into the blown-up Medical Labs, where they find an 
          inert High Sherrif, a stunned Yanar, and... We'll find out about Knuckles 
          later.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          Antoine, Bunnie, Amy Rose and Rob are trying to get to the Labs in a 
          hurry. When the Lifts appear out of order, Rob makes them slide down 
          a rope to the street, then suggests they dress up as Firemen to get 
          into the building unnoticed. Once inside, they try to find out what 
          happened to their friend (and Antoine, what happened to his father), 
          and are all just as shocked as Gala-Na to find that Knuckles is glowing 
          green... Chaos Emerald green. Just like Dimitri was after the Chaos 
          Syphon, we learn thanks to Gala-Na's exposition.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
          Knuckles argues against the implication that he might have something 
          in common with Dimitri, the High Sherrif recovers and gets up. Antoine 
          tries to reach out to his father, but gets slapped aside for his efforts. 
          Knuckles, furious at this action, somehow traps the Sherrif inside an 
          energy bubble. Gala-Na calls for Security forces, apparantly thinking 
          about having the High Sherrif shot to pieces, dispite pleading from 
          Bunnie and Antoine. Antoine tries to convince the Echidna leader that 
          before reaching Mercia, they went to see Rotor in the Northern Tundra, 
          who gave them an Electronic Neutraliser, which would place the High 
          Sherrif in Stasis so he wouldn't harm anyone.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
          this reasoning doesn't seem to sway Gala-Na, who apparantly doesn't 
          trust the High Sheriff's fate to anyone else, and orders the freedom 
          Fighters to step aside...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
          before anyone can do anything else, Knuckles just yells out "NO!", and 
          suddenly, everyone's in different places... Amy's with Rob in their 
          forest, Antoine, Bunnie and the High Sherrif (now in Stasis) are in 
          their plane, heading back to Knothole, and Gala-Na is left there, with 
          her troops, to worry about Knuckles, who is now instinctivly tapping 
          into Dimitri's power, and wonders what will come next...</font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this was a disappointing ending to a promising storyline. The promised 
          Antoine/High Sheriff confrontation was a pathetic one-panel rip-off, 
          Knuckles' condition only confuses us further, and the "Deus Ex Machina" 
          ending was too quick, resolving next to nothing. And don't get me started 
          on Rotor's "return", which turned out to be a one-panel flashback... 
          Let's hope things get better next month... </font>
