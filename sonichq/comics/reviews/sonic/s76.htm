        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">W</font></b>e 
          start out this issue with the our heroes (Sonic, Sally, Tails, Bunnie, 
          Antoine, Sonic's folks) and Snively barely escaping from a squad of 
          Beefed-up Shadowbots and hiding in the outskirts of Robotropolis. Sally 
          interrogates Nicole about how the city is deserted, and Nicole says 
          everyone who could escape is out in Knothole. Snively points that, although 
          the new Robotnik may not know where Knothole is, the old one may have 
          left the info in a file in the computers. And he points the new, Robotic 
          Robotnik will have escaped the exploding satellite last issue by downloading 
          his mind into a new body. Sally's decision is simple: "...It's up to 
          us to prevent him from accessing that file!" At this point, Snively 
          tries to ditch our heroes' company. Sonic has other plans, however. 
          He wants Sniv to help them get that file. And he won't take "no" for 
          an answer. Sniv grudginly agrees. He, Sonic and Sally will go for the 
          file, while Tails, Bunnie and Antoine will take Sonic's parents back 
          to Knothole (after a side-trip to the library in this issues' back-story) 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, in Knothole, 
          we get a large crowd shot panel showing everyone packing into the small 
          village. It also makes a nice "Where's Waldo" number (I found him, and 
          many other small cameos. Can you?). The king makes an appearance, and 
          makes a short speech/proclamation to get things organised. Prince Elias, 
          in the back, wonders how his father can keep his royal bearing, while 
          knowing Sally and the others may be in dire trouble. Nate assures him 
          his father has dealt with much, and he can handle it. Okay. We'll get 
          back to him on that. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in Robotropolis, 
          Sonic, Sally and Snively have arrived in front of Robotonik's HQ, where 
          a squad of Shadowbots are herding a bunch of captured Mobians. Sonic 
          goes on the offensive, taking out the bots, while Sally and Snively 
          sneak their way inside (good thing Robotnik hasn't changed the locks 
          yet). Meanwhile, Dr Robotnik, fresh from his rebirth, it seems, sends 
          out another large bunch of Shadobots at the Hedgehog, this batch equipped 
          with Eye-lasers. Sonic handles them after ordering the civilians back 
          to Knothole.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inside the base, 
          Sally has Nicole do something to the file (we'll find out what later), 
          and, when a Shadowbot attacks, gets her life saved by Snively (ain't 
          that Ironic?). Back outside, Sonic gets rid of the Shadowbots by using 
          speed heat to melt the tar under their feet. (of course, none of them 
          thinks of using it's eye-laser to free itself. Creative thinking ain't 
          part of their programming.) He then keeps a young mobian girl (if you 
          can tell what kind of animal she is, you're a better reader then I. 
          But she was briefly shown in one panel in Sonic #52's back-story) from 
          going into Robotnik's HQ to save a (nameless) "loved-one." He tries 
          to talk her out of it, by sharing survivor stories with her ("I couldn't 
          save my uncle and pet dog from him."...You know.) When Sally and Snively 
          get out, Sally conforts the girl (who's called Mina), while Snively 
          parts company. Back in his HQ, Robotnik tries to access the file with 
          Knothole's location, but ends up catching a computer virus. Sorry Ivo. 
          Better luck next time. </font></p>

          A nice story. Self-contained, yet fits in nicely into standard continuity. 
          The "Back to basics" approach has been used properly, with all the characters 
          (even King Acorn and Prince Elias) being true to nature (or as close 
          as can be in Elias' case). Fry (Jim Fry, but artists are known for exentricity)'s 
          art is great, with a Manga-based flavor a reader can love. The way he 
          draws faces convey emotions well, and he has a good sense of humor (That 
          crowd scene was a nice touch, and I know I saw a few characters from 
          the "No Need For Tenchi Muyo" Anime series in one panel. You gotta love 
          a guy who does Cameo sketches) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I honestly only 
          took off one ring from this rating because the "Mina" character seemed 
          an unnecessary wrinckle. Her "loved one" element was sketchy and undefined, 
          and the small emotional bonding she displayed with Sonic in that two-page 
          scene seemed to hint at things that may not be used further down the 
          line. Other then that, this was a great issue! </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tales 
          of the Great War part 4 Another point of View </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone else slowly 
          staring to get tired of these back stories? Me too. This one especially 
          doesn't contribute a lot to the overall storyline. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off, we get 
          Tails, Bunnie, Antoine and Sonic's folks avoiding Shadowbot patrols 
          while trying to get to the library. We get a short speech on how books 
          are necessary (a bit pointless, really.), then we get to the library. 
          Once there, we get some more exposition until Jules Hedgehog picks up 
          a book and starts (for no reason in perticular) to read a passage about 
          the Great War. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay, we get a short 
          scene explaining how the Overlanders where trying to blast Mobotropolis 
          and it's people to extinction, and a small thought balloon showing us 
          how far Colin Kintobor will go to get rid of his brother (let me put 
          it this way: He's not sorry he's killing lots of innocent furries), 
          while many furries (amongst them Jules and Charles) rush to the bunkers 
          for safety. From there, Bernie and a cat who appears to be Hershey's 
          mother (Her name's Cocoa. Har har...) lead a counter attack group through 
          the sewers to go behind enemy lines for a surprise attack. Once there, 
          there is a large battle between Mobians and Overlanders. Amadeus gets 
          his eye-shot out (he lives) and Colin barely escapes. 'Nuff said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Afterwards, The 
          king shows a pic of the Overlander leader to Julian (he suggest continued 
          combat) and the King presents the new warlord to the people. Jules makes 
          a small statement about how important books are and they decide to take 
          all they can carry, before coming back for what else they can need. 
          </font></p>

          </b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This story 
          was utterly unnecessary. The art was questionnable, the storytelling 
          forced and preachy ("Books are important!" Yeah...we got the point the 
          first time already!), the narration was needlessly formal, and way too 
          much stuff was forced into one short story (Did we need to know Hershey's 
          mom [or whatever] was called Cocoa? Or that Amadeus lost his eye then 
          and there?). It seems Archie's backstories are once again dragging down 
          the rest of the book. </font></p>
