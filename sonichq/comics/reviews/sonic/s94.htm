          Order is the name of the game in this issue, folks, and it's really 
          appropriate. Useless fact time: most conspiracy buffs tend to use the 
          term "New World Order" as a euphamism for the concept of a total dictatorship. 
          Kinda puts Elias's new rule in a whole new light, right?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We start this issue a few 
          weeks after the end of Sonic #93, thus cheating us of the sight of Sonic 
          complaining to Elias and St-John (Whom I shall now affectionally call 
          "The John", in homage to the toilet), and just cuts to what Knothole 
          has been doing since we last left them: They've started turning Knothole 
          into a full fledged Kingdom, complete with modern accomodations: Royal 
          Castle (A huge prority, I'm sure), Hospital, Prison (What, the Devil's 
          Gulag wasn't good enough?) and, worst of all, a Public School.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, Elias and The John are 
          quickly showing their incompetence as leaders already: Dr Robotnik, 
          the guy who wants to turn all the Mobians on the planet into robotic 
          slaves, having already done so to countless many, is out there, plotting 
          to destroy Knothole, and building castles and public schools is a priority? 
          This makes the Clinton school of Military Administration look smart! 
          People, just leave the kids with guardians who'll double as tutors, 
          and focus on building up your military forces before the guy turns you 
          into cuisanarts, ok?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We cut to the sigh of Sonic 
          with his friends (minus Sally, at the castle, and Antoine, apparently 
          visiting his father in the prison). Sonic's been doing some narrating 
          thus far, and then asks the question we all want to know: "Since when 
          to Freedom Fighters need to learn Algebra, anyway?" His primary concern 
          is what happened to Sally, however.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We cut to the Royal Castle, 
          to see Sally in her new room, checking her own school materials. Uh, 
          since when does Sally need to take new lessons? In Sonic #19, it's established 
          that Julayla, her late Mentor, fully trained Sally in the arts of science, 
          litterature, and even leadership. Heck, she -COMPLETED- that training 
          before Julayla died. Sally needs to go to school like Sonic needs to 
          become more impatient!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Anyways, as she's going through 
          her stuff, a picture slides out of the book, which shows Sally and Sonic 
          (as drawn by Art Mawhinney). Sally starts to get melancholic about how 
          she misses Sonic, but as soon as The John pops in to tell Sally her 
          family wants her, she hides the picture! Odd... Why would she be ashamed 
          of it?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">She meets with her parents 
          and brother on the balcony, looking over the nearly completed new Kingdom, 
          and the Queen comments on how beautiful the kingdom is, and how Robotnik 
          can keep the dirty old city of Robotropolis. Yeah, Queenie, let Dr Eggman 
          keep the city with the large factories and robot armies, along with 
          the thousands of roboticized slaves, so he can continue plotting the 
          downfall of you and your people. (Folks, am I the only one who's wondering 
          where Sally got her brains? Lord knows she can't have gotten them from 
          either her mother OR her father...)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Meanwhile, back in the "Awful 
          City" of Robotropolis, the Overlanders have settled into the grim and 
          gritty metropolis, and into an urban reality reminiscent of Orwell's 
          "1984", complete with Robot cops and 9:00PM Curfews. Meanwhile, Colin 
          and his family are still guests at Julian's pad, and Colin seems to 
          insist on making quality time with his "dear brother", no matter how 
          much it annoys The Eggman. Agnes complains about the robot guards being 
          inside the city, but Julian assures her they're there to keep the furries 
          out of the city, which leads Hope to start thinking "But wasn't it THEIR 
          city?"</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Before she can ask the question 
          outloud, however, Colin comments on how much Julian's changed... in 
          personality, apparantly (How this guy got his job, I'll never know.), 
          since the time he was condemned to ten years in prison. When Julian 
          asks about why the Overlanders where in outer space, Colin tells him 
          his people, after losing the war, wanted something new. And apparently, 
          a ten-year vacation into deep space, without rhyme or reason, was the 
          thing. Before Colin can continue with the nostalgic narrative, they 
          get interrupted with the knews the robots captured a curfew violator: 
          Snively.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">More on that later, as we 
          return to Sonic and Tails, preparing to go to sleep in their room, after 
          a little teasing on Tails' part on how Sally "loooooves" Sonic. Let's 
          try to remember that fact, though, shall we? The next morning, our heroes 
          get a rude awakening from an earthquake which shakes Knothole without 
          announcement. After some quick preperation and checking up with Sonic's 
          parents, Sonic and Tails go out to save a construction crew from getting 
          smashed by a falling tree. Enjoy this scene, it's the only Sonic action 
          sequence you get this issue.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Robotropolis, Robotnik 
          goes to visit Snively in his holding cell, and makes a deal: help him 
          continue the scam over the Overlanders, and he'll help Snively get revenge 
          on Colin, the father who never appreciated him. And judging from Sniv's 
          evil grin, he seems to like the deal. So much for Sniv becoming one 
          of the good guys later on, huh?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Sonic and 
          co. arrive at the school and hook up with Rotor, who's now dressed like 
          a Limp Bizket fan, and Bunnie, who's now wearing the latest in "Southern 
          Ho Chic" (So much for family aimed entertainment), before Tails has 
          to leave to go with the other kids his age.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Robotropolis, Hope, 
          after 6 weeks of working up the nerve, starts to sneak around Robotropolis 
          to find out more about it, and gets spooked by a Robian Slave, just 
          before running off crying... I guess it'll take her a few more weeks 
          to work up the nerve to do that again...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Tails breaks 
          off from his fellow students to fetch his bookbag, but gets interrupted 
          by a vision of Athair, who whisks him away without warning with only 
          a "You are Needed" for explanation. (Don't you hate it when that happens 
          on the first day of school?) Meanwhile, in Sonic's class, our hero finds 
          out Mina's in his class, with a seat right next to his. Sonic's disappointed 
          Sally hasn't shown up, though. Lord knows I am. Bunnie takes the other 
          seat next to Sonic, but gives Mina the cold shoulder. Then again, if 
          I was a girl who's best friend's boyfriend was being stalked by another 
          girl, I wouldn't be too friendly with said other girl myself.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Before this can continue, 
          however, Nate Morgan appears and announces himself as their physics 
          teacher. And now we know King Acorn doesn't pay his people well, if 
          they have to take TEACHING jobs to support themselves, of all things. 
          After a grueling class, he gives a curious Sonic the latest bombshell 
          from the Royal family: Sally's recieving private lessons at Castle Acorn, 
          and isn't gonna mingle with the "Commoners" anymore.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">To be continued...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Rating: </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="../../images/ring.gif" width="16" height="16"></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="../../images/ring.gif" width="16" height="16"></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="../../images/ring.gif" width="16" height="16"></b></font>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, anyone get the feeling 
          things were better for the Freedom Fighters BEFORE they brought back 
          the Royal Family? One wonders why they went to the trouble to get King 
          Acorn back in the first place...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">The story isn't terrible, 
          but it isn't a breakthrough either. The plot advances slowly, but so 
          far only to make things as bad as possible for Sonic and his friends. 
          If it isn't The Royal Family making things impossible for Sonic, it's 
          Mina trying to pull him away from Sally. Good thing Robotnik's got family 
          problems of his own, or else things would really hit the fan for our 
          heroes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, I'm starting to think 
          that maybe... just -Maybe-, Bollers is doing all of this intentionally: 
          darkest before the dawn, and so on. But still, the way Bollers is setting 
          up this big storyline of his, he's alienating a lot of good fans in 
          the process. The climax of this story had BETTER be good...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Knuckles Review:<br>
          &quot;The Best Laid Plans...&quot;<br>
          Written and Inked by Ken Penders <br>
          Pencilled by Ron Lim </font></p>
        <div align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We pick up this story from 
          where we left off last issue, with the Weasel Twins packing up their 
          gear after leaving Knuckles with the Echidnas of Albion to get Chaos 
          Drained. Meanwhile, Charmy and Saffron are searching for their friend. 
          This will be important later. Really. </font> </div>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back with the Echidnas, Knuckles 
          is being tied up to a Chaos Syphon, even as Gala-Na explains why this 
          is necessary: Knux' power is growing too much for him to control safely, 
          and the only way to deal with that threat is to use the Syphon... No 
          matter what may happen. And without more of an apology, they activate 
          it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Much to their surprise, however, 
          Knuckles starts to resist the drain, forcing the Echidnas to try increasing 
          the power. But before they can succeed, Charmy and Saffron show up and 
          shift to micro-size to interfere with the process, causing a feedback 
          loop which actually Super-Charges Knuckles' power, transforming him 
          into... A Green Knuckles with no pupils, actually. Of course, before 
          anything happens, Knuckles suddenly vanishes from sight, after commenting 
          that it felt as if someone had flipped a switch and changed things.</font></p>
        <div align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">So while the Echidnas contemplate 
          their failure, they try to contact the Weasels for another mission, 
          but only get a "Sorry, we'll pass" as a response. How nice and professional, 
          guys. They fly away, leaving Gala-Na asking "Now what?", echoing the 
          thoughts of all the readers in the process. </font> </div>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, This back-up served only 
          one purpose, it seemed: To set things up so Knuckles becomes a prime 
          suspect for the part of Ultimate Villain in the upcoming storyline for 
          #100. Otherwise, the story is completly forgettable, which Is what I'd 
          rather be doing about it, if no-one minds.</font></p>
