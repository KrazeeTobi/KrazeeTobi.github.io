          </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">T</font></b>his 
          story picks up where last issue left off, with Sonic and Tails doing 
          some scouting around the area where the Freedom Special crashed, and 
          having a little fun race as they're doing it. Meanwhile, we get a little 
          narration from someone who says he's about to destroy their happiness...</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tails, 
          while flying, has a little trouble with an updraft, and falls down. 
          After Sonic helps him recover, they stop to talk a while, with Sonic 
          giving Tails a short pep-talk, saying he'll learn to master those moves 
          soon enough. Then he sends Tails to gather firewood while he starts 
          the kindling.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          an hour of waiting for Tails, Sonic knows something's wrong, and goes 
          looking for him, just about everywhere... Until he meets up with Metal 
          Sonic, who seems better than ever. Seems that after the more recent 
          beating he received from Knuckles back in the Chaotix special, Metal 
          Sonic actually rebuilt himself from scratch, actually improving himself. 
          In fact, when Sonic attacks him, he finds out that Metal Sonic is actually 
          FASTER then he is! That, and the fact MS has more gadgets, makes the 
          first round an easy victory for MS. Sonic realizes, a bit too late, 
          that Metal Sonic has a Power Gem on his chest, the same one that once 
          turned him into a Giant back in the Chaotix special. That's what's giving 
          Metal Sonic his supercharge of power.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
          by the time Sonic realizes this, Metal Sonic has already beaten him 
          up and pinned him to a mountain wall. MS then gives him a challenge: 
          Tails is currently held atop Mt Mobius, which is a volcano rigged to 
          blow soon. The contest is a race. If Sonic can race atop the volcano 
          before it blows, Tails is saved. If not...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyways, 
          off Sonic goes, zooming his way to the Mountain as fast as he can, but, 
          half-way there, Metal Sonic shows up to knock out Sonic again.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          story ends on a cliff-hanger note, with Metal Sonic gloating to Tails 
          that Sonic has lost once and for all, and Tails defying him, saying 
          Sonic will save him soon enough. To Be Continued.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this was a very good story, compared to the previous issues. We get 
          the return of a classic villain, and Metal Sonic seems better (and badder) 
          then ever! Of course, we all know Sonic will get his second wind next 
          issue, and will kick MS's can six ways form sunday, but this is still 
          a gripping story.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          now, for a less interesting story; the origins of Monkey Khan.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Monkey 
          Khan in: &quot;Against the Haunted Past&quot;</b> </font>

          <br>
          </font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          start Ten years ago, back when Julian Kintobor was still the Warlord 
          of Mobotropolis; he makes a nice facade of being a humanitarian, devising 
          medical break-throughs, but is in fact planning to build a Cyborg army 
          in his service. But first he needs guinea pigs to work on.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          he conveniently finds them in the outer reaches of the Kingdom, in an 
          immigrant settlement of Leung West, where a group of pacifist, artisans 
          and intellectuals have build a new home. There, young Ken Khan, son 
          of the community leader, happens to be a trouble-maker, as he's the 
          only aggressive youth in the village. He asks his father what if they 
          were attacked, how would they defend themselves, and his father says 
          there is no conflict that cannot be resolved through communication and 
          reason, which is why their community is neutral in the war with the 
          Overlanders.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
          course, after making such a bold and noble sentiment, a tragically ironic 
          turn of events is bound to happen. And it does: Dr Robotnik chooses 
          that moment to attack the village and capture its people to use as guinea 
          pigs.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          cut to some time later, after Kintobor has finished with his experiments, 
          he says none of them were strong enough to accept the alterations, and 
          all rejected them: All but Ken Khan, who just happened to be the only 
          one of them who was aggressive. In other words, pacifism makes you weak 
          and die... Nice moral, Strom.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kintobor 
          decides to give Monkey Khan a final test run, and sics him on an Overlander 
          patrol, trashing it entirely. But just as Kintobor starts gloating, 
          Khan starts rebelling and regains his free will, attacking him, with 
          Julian barely able to use a weapon to knock the cyborg in time. Then 
          he wisely decides to permanently confine the monkey, let he comes back 
          to haunt him later. (I'd have had the ape dissected, but that's just 
          me)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          skip ahead ten years into the future, after a brief one paragraph recap 
          of what happened to Khan (He got freed, then went back to Kar Leung, 
          his ancestral home). We find Khan waking up inside a mysterious base, 
          where he's confronted by the electronic image of Dr Robotnik, back from 
          the dead! Well, actually, this isn't the original version: it's not 
          even the version who originally turned Khan into a cyborg, but what's 
          a little continuity between friends? The story ends there, with a "To 
          Be Continued" note. Seems like the month for those, huh?</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'll 
          admit, this story was actually diverting. Pointless, and focused on 
          a character I could care less if they'd dismantle him and used him as 
          VCR parts, but diverting anyway. We finally get Monkey Khan's origin 
          story, and it's actually not half-bad as far as origins go. The "I lost 
          my family due to Robotnik's experiments that turned me into a being 
          with incredible powers" is one that you can find in a hundred Sonic 
          fanfics on the net, but it's not badly executed this time.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          fact that Strom only seems to work on Sonic stories involving the Khan 
          leads me to believe he made this deal with Ken: "Ok, I'll do some Sonic 
          stories; but I get to try out this character idea I've been having to 
          do so." Now, I don't mind Monkey Khan, except he has "Self- Inclusion 
          Fanfic Character" written all over him. I think everyone who's checked 
          out Sonic Fics on the net would agree with me. Same problem with Nate 
          Morgan, actually, but that's another rant.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strom 
          could write and draw some wonderful Sonic stories, if only he'd quit 
          his fixation on his pet creation Monkey Khan.</font></p>
