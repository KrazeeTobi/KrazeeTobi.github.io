        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2"><b><font size="+1">G</font></b>ee, 
          with a Trek rip-off title like that, I wonder who's going to be this 
          issue's special guest star?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">After a short teaser of "the 
          guest star" walking across the desert, hate driving him forward, we 
          skip to Dr Robotnik, who gives us the quick recap of Sonic having lost 
          the Sword of Acorns to him, before he lost it himself, but since Sonic 
          thinks Robo still has the sword, he can take advantage of the situation. 
          A pretty unneccessary recap, actually.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">We go to Sonic, in the Forbidden 
          Zone (How many of those are there?), who finds out the meteors were, 
          in fact, the starships last seen before the Sonic Adaptation (Ok, who 
          called it?), which were carrying the long lost Overlanders, lead by 
          Lord Kintobor. Apparantly, the ships were programmed to land near the 
          largest city on the planet, and that's Robotropolis, these days. A little 
          child spots Sonic, and they all immediatly start panicking, as good 
          little Human-like beings do when confronted with the bizarre. Good to 
          know Brollers respects some conventions. Before Sonic and Kintobor (Who 
          was ready to attack our hero) can come to blows, however, a Combot arrives 
          on the scene and attacks an Overlander. Fortunetly, Sonic manages to 
          save the lady, and we all assume this is a good thing. More on that 
          later...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Rotor and 
          Mina find out that there's a commotion about the Sword of Acorn getting 
          stolen. Rotor lets slip that Sonic was getting it back, but in spite 
          of Mina's pathetic attempt at covering up (She just coughs to interrupt 
          the Walrus. LA-AME!), Geoffery (The Investigating Expert) isn't fooled, 
          and he demands answers. Ooh, I'm shaking in my booties...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Robotropolis, Dr Robotnik 
          is watching the return of the Overlanders on screen, along with Sonic's 
          presence. He says something about missing his Native Race (I figured 
          him as one who prefered the company of machines, myself), but then he 
          sees "his" brother Colin, and swears to roboticize them all. I know... 
          I was worried he was going soft too. And the "Alternate version of Robotnik" 
          explanation is apparantly becoming tedious to the writers as well, who 
          only added it to Robotnik's speech as an afterthought, it seemed. Though 
          why he would refer to himself as an Alternate Reality Robotnik, and 
          not as a Real Robotnik stuck in an alternate Reality is beyond me. In 
          any case, he decides on a simple ruse to earn the trust of the Overlanders...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">While Sonic is out with the 
          Overlanders, trying to convince the suspicious humanoids that he's one 
          of the good guys, Lord Kintobor states that maybe the robot was trying 
          to protect them. Yeah, Colin, lord knows that having a robot seize you 
          and trying to take you away is my idea of protection. But before Sonic 
          can reply, Dr Robotnik shows up in holographic form and confirms Kintobor's 
          thoughts and agrees with his "brother", stating that the "Protectobots" 
          were designed to fight the "Furry Menace", and that he offers the Overlanders 
          sanctuary against the Savage Mobians. But before Sonic can convince 
          the people to see through Robotnik's lies, the cheese hits the fan when 
          Monkey Kahn shows up and scares everyone by attacking Ivo's Hologram 
          (classic sociopathic combat monster mistake #23), causing the Overlanders 
          to run for cover and take Robotnik's offer of shelter, in spite of Sonic's 
          protest. So much for reason...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Mina is 
          being interrogated by Lord Torquemada... I mean Geoffery St-John, concerning 
          the location of the Sword. Hershey asks him to step out for a second, 
          then manages to "Good Cop" the info out of Mina, and they both find 
          out that Sonic did the deed all right. And we get the hint that Hershey 
          still has a crush on Geoffery before we cut to another scene (Boy, she 
          just goes for all the wrong guys, doesn't she?)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Robotropolis, Sonic's 
          trying to cool down the maniacal Khan, who's so starving for Robotnik's 
          blood he's willing to wipe out all the Overlanders along the way, giving 
          Robotnik more arguments to convince the Overlanders that he's the good 
          guy and the Furries are the villains. And the two furries continue to 
          fight and argue...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Knothole, Tails wonders 
          where Sonic went, but finds Rotor instead, giving him the warm welcome 
          he's overdue. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Knothole, Sally and Alicia are 
          catching up, with Sally telling her mom everything that's been happening, 
          including her taking charge of the freedom fighters. I get the feeling 
          this could bare fruits later on, but I'm not holding my breath.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Back in Robotropolis, the 
          Overlanders are all lead into Robotropolis just as Sonic breaks off 
          from Khan and rushes for the people, just in time... ...To get stopped 
          by that force-field, getting locked out. And as Sonic gripes about all 
          those people being prisonners, Khan just storms off, ranting and raving, 
          leaving Sonic doing the cliched "KHAN!" yell that anyone with a smidgen 
          of pop-culture knew he was gonna do eventually. Yawn.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, time for some comments. 
          First off, the art was terrible. I don't know where they got this guy, 
          but they should ship him back and ask for a refund... Or pay someone 
          else to take him off their hands, if need be. It's that bad, people. 
          Michael Gallagher looks like Jack "King" Kirby in comparaison, ok? The 
          storyline isn't too bad, except for one thing: It's predictable. And 
          not in the "If you know your story conventions, you might expect this 
          or that" way, but in the "If you're a brain-dead pothead, You can see 
          the plotline coming a mile away" manner. All in all, this isn't a very 
          good story, and I can only hope Brollers will eventually getting things 
          in gear. ...Someday.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">And now, for the back-up story. 
          A break from the Knuckles series, actually.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, let's keep this review 
          short: Sonic has a dream in which he meets up with his friends Tails, 
          Knuckles and Amy, and meets a new friend, Lumina, the guardian of Maginaryworld 
          and the Precioustone, who needs the help of Sonic and friends to fight 
          the evil Void, who took control of the Precioustone and corrupted Maginaryworld. 
          Just as Sonic agrees to help, he wakes up, only to find Lumina and his 
          friends standing in a glowing portal, waiting for him to join them in 
          reality. End tie-in.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok, there's not much to say 
          about this back-up, except that it's short. Another thing is that there 
          won't be a full Sonic Shuffle conversion, which I see as a good thing. 
          The comic's in trouble enough as it is.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">Knuckles will be back next 
          month, though. And so will we.</font></p>
