          a new story</font></div>

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  Story starts... somewhere; Ron Lim didn't draw a very well defined 
                  scenery. But we know Dr Robotnik is there, still fuming at Sonic 
                  for destroying Perfect Chaos (Seems he forgot Chaos was gunning 
                  for him too). So Robotnik decides to sic one of his more recent 
                  attempts at copying Sonic at the rodent: Silver Sonic 2 (The 
                  Sequel)!</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut 
                  to the heavily damaged Station Square, where the citizens are 
                  celebrating our heroes for saving the city. All the FFs are 
                  there, and so is Big, dispite the fact he didn't do much to 
                  actually HELP...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not 
                  that it matters much anyways, since the party is crashed by 
                  Silver Sonic 2, who goes after our hero, launching seeking missiles 
                  at him. Tails, Big and the girls futily try to stop SS2 themselves, 
                  to no avail. Then Sonic zooms back and punches SS2 into a empty 
                  building, which the bot then tries to topple on them both. Dr 
                  R, looking from a remote location, believes he's won when only 
                  SS2 emerges from the rubble and flies off.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...But 
                  when the FFs find no trace of Sonic, only a large hole underneath 
                  the rubble, they know Silver's in for a surprise. Indeed, Sonic 
                  emerges underneath the flying clone and grabs on while it tries 
                  to shake him off. Meanwhile, Sally is having Nicole analyse 
                  the bot's systems, determining it has an infinite energy supply.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, 
                  allow me a short rant here: WHY IS IT KARL BOLLERS HAS TO GIVE 
                  NATE MORGAN ALL THE SMART IDEAS!? The only thing Sally did this 
                  issue was make a nice stand and say a few cute lines. Now, I 
                  have nothing against Nate, but why couldn't Karl have Sally 
                  come up with the brilliant idea!? Sally is supposed to be the 
                  brilliant strategist of the FFs! Not Nate! You know what Sally 
                  has become? That girl on Galaxy Quest who's only job is to repeat 
                  everything to the computer and to repeat everything the computer 
                  says...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*ahem*</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                  anyways, back to the story. After some more scuffling, which 
                  involves Tails getting knocked out, Sonic finally opens a can 
                  of whoop'ass and Sonic Spins SS2's head off. Nice move, Sonic... 
                  Couldn't you do that for starters? Anyways, after checking on 
                  everyone to make sure they're ok, congratulations are given. 
                  But what will be done to keep Robotnik from attacking Station 
                  Square again? (Personally, I'd go for a well armed military 
                  force, myself.)</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
                  Dr Robotnik is mad, cause his pet robot is trashed. But he perks 
                  right up again at the thought of finding his robot with it's 
                  built-in homing device, rebuilding it and using it to conquer 
                  the now vulnerable city. Nice to see he looks on the bright 
                  side of things...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut 
                  to the FFs, who are getting ready to leave after assuring the 
                  Mayor his city is safe. Sally shows a minor lapse in judgement 
                  by offering Big a place amongst the FFs, but thankfully Big 
                  chooses to go back home to Cat Country instead. Smart move. 
                  Farewell Big. Don't forget to write! Don't forget to never come 
                  back! (Sorry Big fans...)</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
                  the FFs get back to their plane and fly off... for a while, 
                  until the FF Special goes into a spin and crashes. Fortunetly, 
                  they can all walk off, but while Sally has Sonic and Tails scan 
                  for life, Nate tells them the plane was sabotaged, and the culprit 
                  is most likely still nearby. In fact, we can see a set of red 
                  glowing eyes following Sonic and Tails as they run off into 
                  the nearby forest.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  finish this story with Dr R going back to Station Square, trying 
                  to find his beloved robot... And he finds it, too! ...Nate rebuilt 
                  it already, and reprogrammed it as Station Square's protector, 
                  against Robotnik. And we leave with the amusing image of Robotnik 
                  getting chased out of town by his own creation. Funny, but not 
                  completely satisfying.</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  story was a nice change from the last few issues, if only because 
                  it was actually a complete, self-contained story with only one 
                  sub-plot. I'm still disappointed by Karl focus in only on Nate 
                  as the secondary character. One would think the clever thinker 
                  Sally would come up with ideas of her own, but noooo... Nate's 
                  "Da Man!" O-K, let's move on.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Art's 
                  decent, but unremarkable. Ron Lim's sceneries aren't very precise, 
                  and we don't get any impression of recognisable geography from 
                  them. And the writing was action-packed, but poor in characterisation 
                  of anyone. All in all, if Karl intends to stay on this book, 
                  he needs to start treating ALL the characters in that title 
                  as people.</font></p>

                  the Walrus in<br>
                  &quot;Home and Back&quot;</b></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
                  first off, the good news: Rotor's alive and well! YES! He wasn't 
                  roboticized in a cheap bid to retire a character!</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Ahem* 
                  Sorry. And now, the plot review:</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  catch to Rotor inside his Bathysphere (which ISN'T Spherical, 
                  BTW), which is sinking like a rock, due to severe damage. While 
                  he sends an SOS with his radio, we go into a flash-back over 
                  the events which lead us to this situation...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                  leaving Knothole a few months ago (to us, it was a few months; 
                  was it really that long for the Mobians?), he met up with the 
                  Arctic Freedom Fighters who gave him the good news: The whole 
                  Walrus heard (including his mother and Lil' brother, last seen 
                  as mind controlled zombie slaves of Robotnik) had regained their 
                  free will with Robotnik's passing. So they spent a few good 
                  months together, as a family again.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Until 
                  he woke up one morning to find the whole Herd was once more 
                  acting like Zombie slaves, ordered to attack Rotor. He hid in 
                  his sub, which they then trashed until it sank... Which brings 
                  us back to the present, where Rotor finally decides to try and 
                  swim for the surface before the water leaks into the electric 
                  wiring, frying him.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                  manages to break free and swim for the surface, but passes out 
                  before he does... Fortunately, the Artic FFs were within rescue 
                  distance by that time, so he's ok. As this story ends, they 
                  give him the bad news he's already deduced: Dr Robotnik's back.</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  story was gripping, dramatic and well written. Quite a change 
                  from Karl Broller's usual work. I guess this is what he can 
                  do when he's not hampered with an Executive work schedule, I 
                  guess. We get a good recap of the last few months of Rotor's 
                  whereabouts, and we get a good set-up for his return to Knothole: 
                  He's gotta come back to fight Robotnik, since it's the only 
                  way he can save his family. Brilliant.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  art was also great; Diamond Rose Studios did a great job here 
                  with their use of coloring and inking. The art on that page 
                  was gripping with great detail.</font></p>

                  in all, a decent issue. The end of the Sonic Adaptation saga 
                  marks the end of the convoluted storylines, and I believe Karl 
                  Brollers' writing might improve now that he can spend more time 
                  in an issue to develop the characters. Now, if he could only 
                  use the Freedom Fighters better...</font></p>
