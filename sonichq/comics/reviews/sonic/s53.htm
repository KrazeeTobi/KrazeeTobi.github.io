<p><b>I got this issue early, just two days after it came out in the 
comic store. The delivery system of Archie must have been upgraded!
    Cover art: Done by Spazainte and Harvey Mercadoocasio. Very 
nice transparent image of Warlord Kodos and a shocked Sonic with 
Dr. Quack. And something else is new on this cover, all the words and 
boxes have shadow effect now.
    Text page art (formerly known as the Splash Page) by: Sam Maxwell
and Harvo. A broken magic wand falling through the sky...nice art 
covered by useless text.    
    First story: "Unfinished Business" script/inking by Ken Penders,
art by Art Mawhinney. Very good art and script, too bad it's only six 
pages long.
    
<p>The story starts out with the Freedom Fighter working to tear down
the former city of Robotropolis. Then Knuckles the Echidna came with
Julie-su in a unidentified flying saucer. Both side informed of each 
other what happened in their comic. It seems Knuckles came because Sally
called him, the reason for that was Sally wanted Knuckles to go on 
another quest to find the real Sword Of Acorn (yeah, Mammoth Mogul’s 
got the real sword). But Knuckles, having just discovered Echidnaopolis
declined because he's got a lot of work ahead of him. Knuckles then 
went with Antoine to find Sonic. This time when the two saw each other,
they didn't try to beat the crap out of each other. Instead they made 
some friendly comments. Who gave Antoine the right to laugh at Sonic's
middle name? Antoine is a worst name than Maurice, ya know! Anywayz, 
Sonic's real first name is not Sonic, could be anything. A good start
for maybe another mini-series or quest.

<p>Its odd that the shortest story ran first, but in the scheme of things it really worked out well in conjuction with the backup - which just happened to be longer. Made for a nice transition. Charater development like <u>THIS</u> we DEFINETELY need.
Kudos to Ken on a nice story. Too bad it was only 8 pages. And is it just me - or is Sonic's middle name just as unfitting as it wants to be! ^______^

<p><u>Backup Story:</u> Sam has <u>greatly</u> improved since he first started
to draw for Sonic, his Sally is still off model, but the detail level
has grown a lot. 
    
<p>Pages 1-4: Sonic and Sally were on a cliff, talking about their 
current situation. On page 4, panel 1, we actually get to see Sally hug
Sonic, a real full contact hug! Too bad Sonic didn't hug back. St. John
then showed up and explained to the pair that Rotor, Uncle Chuck, and 
Dr. Quack has launched a probe into the Zone of Silence. Suddenly, there 
was an explosion...
    
<p>Pages 5-8: The three raced into the lab where Rotor, Chuck, and 
Quack were knocked unconscious by the wizard Ixis Naugus, Warlord Kodos,
and Uma Arachnis. A large fight starts...eh Sam, you forgot to draw 
Sonic's head on page 6, panel 1. After shooting just three arrows, 
St. John got hit in the head by Uma and lost conscious. Here's when the 
whole thing gets really confusing, Sonic seemed to go into a Sonic spin
holding Sally! The spin brought crystals everywhere, blinding Ixis and
his gang long enough for the Freedom Fighters to escape to safety.
    
<p>Pages 9-12: The Freedom Fighters retreated to the King's bedroom.
In there, the king explained to everyone that he made a deal with Ixis
in the Zone of Silence that permits Ixis to gain control of 
Mobotropolis is he ever gets out of the zone. But Sally made the decision
to oppose Ixis with the term "Get lost!".
    
<p>Pages 13-18: Ixis and his group broke through the wall and attacked.
Another big, big fight, in this fight, Sonic some how broke Ixis' magic
wand and they intruders just...disappeared.

<p>This story is not that bad, just a little too confusing. It leaves you wondering how Naugus will come to play in future issues as well as other things. But it just didn't read right for some reason.
Karl's gonna have to get on the ball with the stories...

<p>In Sonic Grams, we get to see the cover to Knuckles #7 and Sonic #54.
After two issues of simple cover arts, we're back to complicated covers 
now. And for all you Nights fans out there, Archie is making a three issue 
mini-series of Nights. It's going to be drawn by Spazainte and Manny. Lets see how much they butcher it !!! ^___^
