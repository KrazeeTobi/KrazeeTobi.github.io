          theme of this issue's main story is extremely simple...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&quot;Perfect 
          Chaos&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We start out with 
          a "teaser" of Locke in Mysterious Cat Country, agreeing to take on the 
          cat's champion, Razorclaw, before he can sit with the queen and negotiate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a brief, one-page 
          fight, Razor's down for the count and Locke tells the queen it's time 
          to talk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We cut to Super-Sonic, 
          who's now on "round 2" of his big fight with Perfect Chaos, continued 
          from last issue. While those two are knockin' and rockin', Knuckles 
          is down on the ground, helping to clear the area.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Antoine's gets 
          hit by a falling stone, Knux jumps to his rescue and gets him to safety, 
          before deciding he's going to go help Super Sonic. About time, Knux...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Super Sonic 
          is still throwing down with Perfect Chaos, Locke is getting a tour of 
          the kingdom from the queen, while talking about the shared history of 
          their race. He's trying to convince her he and his friends aren't here 
          to make war. Unfortunetly, the queen isn't convinced, referring to past 
          disputes. When he says his clan have alwayds tried to strive for good, 
          she shows him something...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Which we'll see 
          some other time, as Knuckles arrives at the city's Generator station 
          and dives into the flooded building to reach the generators, fighting 
          his own fear of water (Funny... I didn't know he had one...)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back to Super-Sonic, 
          who decides to try and run PC ragged by making it chase him around the 
          ruined city. Along the way, he passes Sally who tosses him a copper 
          pipe and tries to tell him to head for the Generator Station; that's 
          all Sonic hears as he zooms by with PC in hot pursuit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Sonic gets 
          in position for PC to run into the live wiring and get shocked, Knuckles 
          arrives at the generator, but finds everything crashed and disconnected. 
          So he slides under the whole thing and, calling on the power of the 
          broken Master Emerald, manages to lift it into place, charging everything 
          up just as PC runs into the wires.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Knuckles emerges, 
          Sonic helps him out of the water, and gets the news: Chaos has turned 
          back into his good, peaceful self, and he and Tical will return to the 
          zone they belong to now.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Sonic complains 
          that "After all that--It's over! Doesn't seem right somehow", thereby 
          echoing all the fans' opinion of this issue, Knuckles is just glad it's 
          over, so he can go back to the Floating Island with the shards of the 
          master Emerald. So he picks up his bag, says goodbye to everyone and 
          goes home.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was an okay story... 
          except it didn't entirely feel like a Sonic story. It was fast-paced, 
          it had action and drama, but... It just wasn't a Sonic story. For one 
          thing, we get the feeling Super-Sonic fighting Perfect Chaos was just 
          a side-show to fill in time while Knuckles got everything in place. 
          Hardly a big, heroic moment for our boy in blue, is it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ken Penders wrote 
          an incredibly well-done story... except it was a Knuckles story, and 
          not a Sonic one. Not that I have anything against Knuckles, mind you. 
          It's just that, in a book called "Sonic the Hedgehog", you'd expect 
          Sonic to be the one who saves the day, not the Echidna. The hero can 
          get help, but ultimatly, it's the hero's bravery which wins the fight, 
          not the secondary character's actions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ken should've kept 
          that in mind as he wrote that story.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&quot;Bridge 
          over Troubled Waters&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And now, for the 
          back-up story, a Knuckles story. (if you hadn't had enough of Knuckles 
          during the main story...)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, after Knux 
          leaves the Freedom Fighters at the end of the main story this issue, 
          Knux uses the Guiding Star Gem (from Knuckles #12) to find his way back 
          to the Island with the Chaos Emeralds. This might say something about 
          his sense of direction...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He gets greeted 
          by Spectre and Sabre, who immediatly take him to the newly designed 
          setting for the Master Emerald. Since the Chaos Chamber was destroyed, 
          the Guardians decided to copy the old Black Emerald setting design for 
          the Master Emerald. (since we never saw any of them leave the Island, 
          I think Knux should start searching his body for hidden cameras...)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Somehow, the Guardians 
          manage to reform the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island regains 
          it's name.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later on, a ship 
          leaves the Island and lands on the coast of Cat Country, with Knuckles 
          stepping out, greeted by some Cat Guards. They take him into the Country, 
          where he gets greeted by the Chaotix.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They lead him to 
          his father and the Cat queen, who are standing besides a large statue 
          commemorating Pachacamac, leader of the late Knuckles Clan, and a foe 
          to the Cats. Locke explains that, while researching his family history, 
          he discovered his family had descended from the Knuckles Clan, a family 
          that left the Echidna homeland and landed in Cat Country, where they 
          began to make war with the locals, lead by Pachacamac, leader of the 
          warrior faction of the family.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Scholars and 
          laborers of the family wanted no part of the bloodshed, and rejected 
          Pachacamac, his followers and even the Knuckles family name, and left, 
          eventually settling in Downunda, where they would found what would become 
          one day the Floating Island.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After much thought, 
          Locke decided to reclaim some of this lost family heritage by naming 
          his son after the old Knuckles clan name. Which shows how much thought 
          and work Locke went to name Knuckles. ...And here we thought he named 
          the kid because of his hands...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Queen explains 
          she was expecting an actual invasion from the Island, until Locke convinced 
          her otherwise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, that's pretty 
          much it. After that, everything added is anti- climactic.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nice back story 
          for Knuckles name, but... Was it really worth an entire back-up to tell? 
          It might've made a better side-story to another, larger story. Other 
          then that, it's ok.</font></p>

          pretty good IMO. A little complaint, it took knuckles to defeat PC. 
          Not that it's a bad thing (since he's my fave char and all), but I wanted 
          SS to defeat PC like in the game. And they spelt Tikal's name wrong 
          again. tsk tsk! ;)</font></p>

          everything was good except for one thing.... the story. It just wasn't 
          as cool when Knuckles helped out. It should have followed the game and 
          has Super Sonic finish it off. It also didn't explain enough when Tikal 
          came in.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 1/5 (4.2) This was 
          one of the best issues in the Sonic Adventure adaptation. They actually 
          made up their own lines, instead of copying it straight from the game, 
          which is cool.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (4) Sonic#84 is 
          a good conclusion because it featured a kick-ass fight between Super 
          Sonic and Perfect Chaos. It may have been re- duced a few pages because 
          of the Kunckles backup(which I give 5 rings)but it was a good issue 
          anyways.</font></p>
