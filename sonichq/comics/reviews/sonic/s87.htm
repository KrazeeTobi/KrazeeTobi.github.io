          continue this story where we left off, with Tails chained up inside 
          the crater of Mt Mobius, on the verge of erupting, and Sonic still not 
          even half-way there.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
          recovers from the sucker-punch he recieved last issue, and resumes running... 
          Unfortunately, he doesn't go far, when he hits another one of Metal 
          Sonic's traps, a large net set up in his path, and he gets entangled 
          in it while Metal Sonic laughs at him from nearby.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
          Sonic breaks lose and continues his race, Metal Sonic just keeps trying 
          to pysche him out with his bragging of how he's better then Sonic in 
          every way.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          mind-game continues with a few attacks from Metal Sonic, as the Power-Stone 
          augmented robot keeps trying to demoralise our hero, who just musters 
          up his "Humanity" and manages to hold up the robot for a time, while 
          he quickly races up the mountain to his buddy.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There, 
          He frees Tails, but before they can leave, Metal Sonic shows up again 
          to attack them. After the intial blow, Sonic decides to try and reason 
          with the robot, pointing out that mechanical power isn't everything, 
          and that Sonic's soul and his feelings for his friends aren't weaknesses.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Metal 
          Sonic scoffs at Sonic's words, until Tails rejects the opportunity to 
          escape, and stays with his friend Sonic. This leaves Metal Sonic speechless 
          (for once).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just 
          then, the Volcanic eruption starts, and to everyone's surprise, Metal 
          Sonic actually SAVES Sonic and Tails, saying that he never realized 
          he could be more then a machine, until now. But the Lava Flow takes 
          him before Sonic can save him as well as he saves Tails.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          the aftermath, Sonic tells Tails that all his words to Metal Sonic were 
          just words, until Tail's dedication to Sonic somehow got to the robot, 
          and made him change, maybe getting a soul of his own.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          we leave on that philosophical note.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this second story was well done, even if "The Evil Robot gets a Soul 
          and turns Good" ending bit was a bit cliched, it was well executed by 
          Danny Figeroth. It was nice to see some emphasis on Sonic's loyalty 
          to his friend Tails, rather then on his "Attitude". The art was excellent 
          too, no problems here. I wish more stories were like this one...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          now, the back-up story.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monkey 
          Khan in: Against the Haunted Past, part 2. Writer/Penciller: Frank Strom 
          Inker: Vickie Williams</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, 
          this story is so simple, I can actually resume it in two paragraphs: 
          Monkey Kahn awakens inside Robotnik's new Kar Leung base, after being 
          somehow captured by General Hunn, Robo's new Robot general. Then, under 
          Robotnik's remote supervision, they try an experimental procedure to 
          try and control Kahn again, but it fails, as Kahn's new Power Ring Headband 
          increases his willpower, keeping him free.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monkey 
          Kahn then breaks out, and along the way, causes the Base (a former Temple)'s 
          Power Generator to blow up, destroying the Base itself to explode. But 
          it's a hallow victory Monkey Kahn finds he's won, as the Town he lived 
          in as already been destroyed, it's population roboticised, leaving Monkey 
          Kahn alone in his hometown.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, 
          this was a disappointing ending to a promising story. Depressing, too. 
          So Monkey Kahn has not only lost his family forever, he has to lose 
          all he's gotten since then, including a new family? Why is it Archie 
          insists on giving Robotnik all these victories? Would it have killed 
          them to let Monkey Kahn save his people, leaving one beacon of life 
          in a dark world? If this keeps up, Mobius is gonna be a ghost-town of 
          a planet. Other then that, this story wasn't too bad. Not too good, 
          definitely not great, but not awful.</font></p>
