        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We 
          start this issue on a very dramatic note, picking up where #88 left 
          off, with the unconscious and wounded King Acorn being rolled into the 
          emergency room and Sally crying her eyes out (well, almost.), then runs 
          out after blaming Sonic, not waiting for Geoffery's explanations. Elias 
          tells both Sonic and StJohn to stay put while he goes to console her.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          Robotropolis, Robotnik moves back in with his forces and slaves, before 
          surveying the damage done and concluding Sonic's been there.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
          in Knothole, Geoffery asks a guard to return the Sword of Acorns back 
          to the Royal Reliquary while Sonic leaves with Tails and Rosie, who 
          tells him not to blame himself about Sally, who was under a lot of pressure 
          before she lashed out at Sonic. Sonic still feels he let Sally down, 
          though, and leaves for his hut with Tails, leaving Mina (Who'd just 
          arrived with the orphans) to wonder why he's so glum.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elsewhere 
          in Knothole, Elias finds Sally and has a talk with her. Sally says she's 
          tired of not having control over anything anymore, ever since she's 
          been removed from the top of the chain of command. Elias reassures her 
          that he agrees, and that Sally is the one who should be the successor. 
          He then tells her that Sonic isn't to blame for King Acorn's condition, 
          since he left the King's side to save him from the Roboticiser, which 
          causes Sally to regret her harsh words.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
          at Sonic's home, our hero is greeted back by his parents, given a hug 
          by his mother while his father tries to reassure him he understands 
          Sonic tried his best. While his mom goes cook breakfast, Sonic's dad 
          tries to console his still despondant son, but is unable to find the 
          words to do so, leaving Sonic to say "I wish Uncle Chuck was still here. 
          He had all the answers..."</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ouch. 
          Can we tell Sonic and Jules have a lot of work to do before building 
          a stable father/son relationship?)</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          get another Interlude as Robotnik, back at his base, checks out security 
          camera footage of the recent invasion of his dwelling, and notices the 
          Sword of Acorns somehow restored Chuck and Muttsky's free will, then 
          orders his robotic troops to go find it.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
          in his room, Sonic comes to the same conclusion about the Sword, and 
          shares his thoughts about that with Tails, before his mother calls him 
          for breakfast: Chilidogs, what else? (lord knows I consider that a breakfast 
          of champions... =-P) Unfortunetly, all this breakfast does is remind 
          Sonic of Uncle Chuck's Chilidog stand. Meanwhile, a passing Mina smells 
          the food and thinks about her own family, taken by Robotnik, and decides 
          to do something about it...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later 
          on, Sonic runs out of his house, then sneaks into the Royal Reliquary 
          and stops in front of the Sword of Acorns...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          Sally and Elias are called back at the Hospital and brought before their 
          parents, who're recovering from the surgery. Elias and Sally are both 
          ecstatic to find that not only is their father alive and well, but that 
          their mother is finally coming out of her coma.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          while the Royal Family's subplot ends on a happy note, the image of 
          Sonic running into the woods carrying the Sword of Acorns, while being 
          watched by a mysterious figure, already launches us into a new storyline.</font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          Karl Brollers has followed up the last issue with a great conclusion 
          for the Royal Family storyline: the Acorn family is once more reunited 
          after years of heartache and seperation, in a heart-warming scene beautifully 
          rendered by fry and Pepoy. In spite of a few lulls in the pace here 
          and there (like in the Robotropolis Interludes), this story delivers 
          with interest. It's interesting to see how Sonic and his parents haven't 
          been really able to build a strong relationship without Chuck's help. 
          I hope this gets resolved in future story. In the meantime, I'm looking 
          forward to the next issue.</font>

          <b>&quot;Matter of Self-Interest&quot;</b></font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Writen 
          by Ken Penders<br>

          Inked by Pam Eklund</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          pick up where last issue left off here as well, with Knuckles, Rob o'The 
          Hedge, Antoine, Bunnie and Amy boating across the sea to Albion, talking 
          about Knuckles' past experience with the ancient Echidna homeland, and 
          how he chose not to stay there with the others.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          on Albion itself, our heroes are being observed through videocameras 
          by a leading council of Echidnas (Voyeurism must be an Echidna trait...), 
          including Gala-Na (who wonders why Knux didn't stay last time) and Yanar 
          (the Mitre of the formerly Lost Tribe, who's defending Knuckles' choice). 
          Another one of them talks about some recent guest of theirs, and how 
          Antoine seems to resemble him. Could it be...?</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
          Rob tells Antoine he doesn't know what happened to the High Sherrif 
          after their last battle, as they land ashore. Knuckles muses that perhaps 
          the Sherrif was someone else's enemy, and that someone else probably 
          took care of him... And as if on cue, Gala-Na pops up and welcomes them 
          to Albion, telling them they'll talk later.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, 
          Knuckles is watching the sunset (Wait, didn't the earlier art show it 
          was night?) and thinks about recent developments, while Bunnie and Amy 
          call it a night. Yanar, warned of this, decides to go talk to Knux, 
          and informs him the High Council of Albion knows why he's here.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before 
          Knuckles can fly off the handle about this, Yanar tells him there's 
          something more pressing concerning his friends: The Former High Sherrif 
          of Snottingham is currently off-line and strapped to a bed in a lab 
          in Albion. Knuckles is brought to see the dormant robot, and is told 
          the High Council has decided to deactivate the guy, for good...</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before 
          the matter can be debated further, however, the High Sherrif suddenly 
          wakes up and tears out of his bindings like the Frankenstein Monster, 
          and attacks Knuckles. We then cut to Antoine and Rob's guest room, as 
          Antoine gets waken in a shock by an explosion outside, and Rob warns 
          him it's time for a battle.</font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          storyline follows last issue's story pretty well, revealing more information 
          about Albion, and showing us how similar Echidna societies tend to be, 
          wherever they're found. And it ends on a highly dramatic cliffhanger. 
          Butler's art is well done, with some good paneling which enhances the 
          storyline. Catch the second panel of the last page, where the High Sherrif 
          and Knuckles' posing match the panel with Antoine and Rob o'the Hedge 
          underneath it. Mind you, there are still a few art bloopers, like Gala-Na's 
          change in hair color from her appearance in Knuckles #14, to Knucles' 
          sunset scene after is was shown it was already nighttime. Other then 
          that, great story, great art.</font>
