          people, here it is: The actual beginning of the Sonic Adventure adaptation. 
          We've been kept waiting twice as long as we should've while they set 
          this up, let's hope it's worth it...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sonic 
          the Hedgehog<br>
          "Night of Chaos"</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          we meet up up with our hero as he's leaping around the rooftops of Station 
          Square, thinking about comic book characters he used to read about as 
          a kid. Sonic sees some police cars rushing through the stormy night 
          and chases after them, only to find them trying (without success) to 
          capture a large watery creature that is Chaos 0 from the Sonic game 
          intro.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
          the police's weapons prove useless, Sonic leaps in and tries to take 
          on the monster himself. When his own sonic spins show to be useless 
          as well, Sonic just dodges the monster's attacks, until it runs up a 
          flagpole, apparently to attack from above. Sonic, undaunted, just runs 
          around the flagpole (fights urge to sing "ring around the posies..."), 
          causing Chaos to fall off the flagpole. As soon as it falls, Chaos flees 
          to the nearest stormdrain and escapes, leaving Sonic to say his game 
          line ("I'll play with you some other time!") and gets congratulated 
          by the Cops...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...While 
          above, from a building, Dr Robotnik watches Sonic and gloats, reciting 
          his own line from the intro.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          story was way better then the last few issues, if only because something 
          actually happened! Shame it was so short. It would've been nice if they'd 
          done more then just rennact the Choas 0 fight scene. Maybe a nice flashback 
          where Sonic and Sally spoke (or better yet, one where Sally caught Sonic 
          oogling at other girls... would've been a nice, funny scene). A good 
          story nonetheless.</font></p>
        <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Knuckles 
          the Echidna<br>
          "Door to the Past" </b></font></div>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Link 
          to the past was already taken, I guess.)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          as we assumed last issue, we finally find out what Knuckles saw last 
          issue: That little floating firefly that turns out to be Tikal, the 
          ghostly Echidna femme from the past. She begins to communicate telepathically 
          with him, telling him her history.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apparently, 
          when a boatload of Echidnas left Albion long ago (as told in "The Forgotten 
          Tribe, part 3, Knuckles #12), they first established themselves in a 
          southern area of Mobius, near the Mysterious Cat Country (insert ominous 
          musical sting here). They and the native Cats got into an argument, 
          which soon became a long war. The Echidnas themselves were divided as 
          to what to do: The Warriors, called the "Knuckles Caste" (Hmm...) wanted 
          to stay and fight. The Scientists just wanted to leave; so the group 
          split up, the Science guys leaving the warriors behind.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          Warriors established themselves there, raising their families to fight 
          the cats. Later on, they found the mystic ruins, inhabited only by the 
          innocent little Chao. While exploring the ruins herself while her father 
          went off to fight, Tikal made friends with the Chao, and even met with 
          Perfect Chaos himself.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
          the war with the Cats went badly, and the Echidnas, desperate, went 
          to get the Seven Emeralds from the Ruins to gain their powers. Re-enacting 
          her part from the game, Tikal tried to stop them, to no avail. Pachacamac, 
          her father and the leader of the Warriors lead them to attack Chaos, 
          ticking it off and making a monster out of it. Tikal then tells Knuckles 
          (flashback over) that she and the Chao tried to fight the now corrupt 
          Chaos, trapping it inside the Black Emerald, but not without paying 
          a price.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
          there, we cut to Dr Robotnik's ship, where his E-series robots are bringing 
          back all sorts of frogs. Seems Robotnik's looking for one with the "Chaos 
          Tail". Of all the robots, only E-102 Gamma brings back the right one. 
          What happens to him and the other bots will be revealed later on. Afterwards, 
          Robotnik brings the frog to a worktable where he hooks the poor critter 
          up to a device which transfers the Chaos energy out of it, along with 
          a sample of it's DNA, beaming both into Chaos, turning it into Chaos 
          0, from earlier in this issue.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
          Robotnik unleashes Chaos to an unsuspecting world, The Cat Emperess 
          greets her "guests", the Chaotix. The Cats, apparantly, believe them 
          and the Island from whence they came to be threats to themselves (never 
          mind the fact the cats themselves invaded the Island without warning).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          the usual "mouth shooting" from Vector, Julie-Su tries to negociate 
          (from a position of strength, no doubt), when Locke enters the scene, 
          stating the "Knuckles Clan" is willing to restart the war the Cats started 
          long ago.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not 
          a bad story, this one. Very good work adapting the Sonic Adventure storyline 
          to fit it into the world of Archie's Knuckles universe. This "Knuckles 
          Clan" element sounds like a new, interesting facet of the Echidna culture. 
          Obviously, from Locke's statement, there is a link between the Guardians 
          and the Knuckles clan. And Knuckles himself, from his name alone, definetly 
          sounds like he has a link to this clan. This is something, we should 
          hope, the writers develop in the near future.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Final 
          tale in this issue is the Back-up story, giving E-102 Gamma's origin. 
          We also get some stuff from previous issues explained here.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-102<br>
          "Double-Crossed Circuits"</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          find Gamma within the Egg-carrier, looking at stasis tubes holding Metal-Sonic 
          and Silver-Sonic (from the SA game), while the narration talks about 
          how odd-looking those things are.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gamma's 
          observations are interupted by Robotnik, who orders Gamma to go through 
          an obstacle course which contains robotic copies of Knuckles, Tails 
          and Sonic (for target practice). Gamma makes short work of those copies 
          (we don't even get to see them fight back).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robotnik 
          then assembles the E-100 robots, sends them looking for that frog from 
          the Knuckles story, and only Gamma returns with the right one. We also 
          get some more narration muses about how Gamma only obeys orders, without 
          question. After he brings the right creature, Robotnik congratulates 
          him... and destroys the other E-series units. He then orders Gamma to 
          go fetch the flicky with Amy Rose in the brig.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unbeknownst 
          to Robotnik, Gamma actually hesitates before obeying orders, as if thinking. 
          The narration then comments about how surprising this is, since he's 
          just a robot, ain't he? Or is he?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
          he actually arrives at Amy's cell, she pleads with him to let the bird 
          go. This triggers something within Gamma, making him use a self-diagnostic, 
          which makes Gamma realize how evil and destructive Robotnik really is. 
          End result: Gamma frees Amy and the flicky, letting her roam the ship, 
          while he's ordered to go to the command deck. Gamma obeys for now.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          the end, we're left with the impression that Gamma is now a free-willed 
          being, and that he can feel loss and regret.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          story wasn't so bad; the unique narration was rather innovative, and 
          the art was quite decent. The obstacle course sequence was a bit gratuitous, 
          but since we obviously won't see Gamma go after Sonic for real, this 
          is most likely the closest we'll get to a Sonic/Gamma fight. All in 
          all, a good back-up story.</font></p>
