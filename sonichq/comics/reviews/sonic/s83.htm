        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="+1">W</font></b>ell, 
          after the fiasco that was the Sonic Adventure Adaptation in SSS #13, 
          one would hope the storyline would pick up. It does... sorta.</font></p>
                
        <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Menace 
          to Society"</b></font></div>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  start with Knuckles, fresh from co-starring with Sonic in the 
                  Sonic Adventure adaptation, as he returns to the Mystic Ruins 
                  to resume his exploration of them. There, he is surprised to 
                  find Dr Robotnik, uncounscious on the floor. While he's debating 
                  to himself whether or not he should take advantage of the situation 
                  to finish the Doc off (I say Go for it!), the now familiar form 
                  of Chaos sneaks up on him...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
                  at the Hidden City, Sonic's telling his friends about how he 
                  and Knuckles vanquished Chaos, and also about how he lost Tails' 
                  bi-plane. Fortunetly, Nate says he had the foresight to install 
                  a tracer in the plane when he designed the young fox's plane. 
                  He gives Sonic a device and he and Tails leave to find the plane. 
                  Thanks plot-de... I mean Nate!</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soon 
                  afterwards, Sonic and Tails arrive at the ruins, and find Knuckles, 
                  who was knocked uncounscious (they also ignore Robotnik... I 
                  think he's kinda hard to miss, don't you?) and rush to him. 
                  While Dr Robotnik makes his escape, Knuckles holds Sonic and 
                  Tails back from going after him, saying the real foe is Chaos, 
                  who is NOT yet destroyed. He suspects Chaos' return may have 
                  something to do with Tails' plane.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
                  decide to track down the plane to find out more. They arrive 
                  in Cat Country, where they find Big, who's just awakening from 
                  having been knocked out by some mysterious foe. While this interrogation 
                  is going on, Tails finds his plane, which has been totally trashed. 
                  Just then, a watery Tornado runs them over, focing them to hang 
                  on for dear life as it passes over them. Sonic deduces it's 
                  Chaos, and sees it's now powering itself with the bi-plane's 
                  power source, the Super-Emerald (when normal emeralds aren't 
                  enough...). Now it's super-charaged and heading straight for...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Station 
                  Square, where the Freedom Fighters (who haven't been doing any 
                  fighting in a long while) are getting a tour of the Hidden City's 
                  Power Plant/Environmental Control station, which generates everything 
                  from the day/night cycles to the weather in the Hidden City's 
                  dome. And what powers this plant? why, nothing less then 6 Super-Emeralds, 
                  of course! (gee... ain't THAT convenient...) Suddenly, Chaos' 
                  watery form seeps in through the room over the Emerald Display 
                  chamber, floods it and disappears with the Emeralds!</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, 
                  outside, in the Hidden City, we're treated to a three-page spectacular 
                  scene where Perfect Chaos floods the streets, smashes the roads 
                  and buildings, and generally trashes everything as he makes 
                  his big entrance from the game...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                  the Freedom Fighters do their best to help evacuate the people, 
                  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles... and Big show up and wonder how they'll 
                  stop Chaos now. Before they can think of something, Robotnik's 
                  Eggship breaks through into the Dome! ...Wait a minute; didn't 
                  Robotnik's Eggship get blown up last issue? That's a darn big 
                  plothole. Anyhow, Dr Robotnik shows up, but Chaos, apparantly 
                  tired of the fatman (lord knows most of us are) swats him away.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                  Sonic is happy to see Robotnik get his, it doesn't solve the 
                  immediate problem of what to do with Chaos. Knuckles says "We 
                  must still contend with the creature! Our enemy's enemy is not 
                  our ally! The Water beast is overflowing with power!" ...Okay, 
                  who are you and what have you done with Knux? Knuckles doesn't 
                  speak like Captain Picard on Star Trek, people. Anyways, Tikal 
                  then shows up, does both the vision thing to explain Chaos' 
                  origin AGAIN, and then appears completly in a glowing, ghostly 
                  form before them all, and explains that Chaos ain't Evil, just 
                  misguided, and that they have to defeat it without destroying 
                  it. Easier said then done.</font></p>
                <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><ip>Tikal 
                  uses some ancient Echidna voodoo to weaken Perfect Chaos and 
                  extract the Super-Emeralds, which she tosses to Sonic. Using 
                  a line from the game ("Our hearts together form an awsome power"), 
                  she charges them with positive emotions and turns Sonic into 
                  Super-Sonic (Faster than your average Sonic; More powerful then 
                  a dozen Chilidogs; able to work his way through any plot complication...) 
                  </font> </div>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goku... 
                  Sorry, Super-Sonic flies into action, charging straight into 
                  Perfect Chaos, fighting the internal tides and creating a whirlpool 
                  to nock the stuffings out of Chaos, who goes down for a count. 
                  But before Sonic can enjoy the congratulations of his friends, 
                  Chaos gets back up for round two...</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...Which 
                  happens next issue, unfortunately.</font></p>

                  story wasn't bad, but there's still room for improvement. For 
                  one thing, the Freedom Fighters are still relegated to the role 
                  of minor extras, when they should be secondary characters at 
                  most. To say nothing of Sally's limited "airtime". Many elements 
                  of the plotline seemed contrived, like the Hidden City's use 
                  of 6 Super-Emeralds in their power-plant. Knuckles sudden "oxford 
                  acting" is out of character for him in the comic, and Tical 
                  seems to be after Nate Morgan's "Living Plot-device" job.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  is better then the past few issues (by a small margin) but there's 
                  still far to go before we can call this a quality title again.</font></p>
