          to the grand #25 gala issue of Knuckles the Echidna! We start the issue 
          with Knux and Julie-Su looking around the "Technology Now campaign HQ", 
          also known as "Dark Legion Central". Knux suddenly sees a familiar figure 
          and chases after it, leaving Julie-su behind. As usual. He catches up 
          with the figure outside, and it turns out to be his father. What do 
          you think Knuckle's reaction to seeing the father he thought was dead, 
          but was just in hiding, is? That last thing you'd expect from him: He 
          runs to hug, with tears in his eyes! (minor note: this one silhouette 
          over Knux's head in that splash page looks like Darth Vader's head. 
          Coincidence, or a bad omen?) After a touching moment with more heart 
          then an entire season of "Full House", Knuckles breaks the hug, saying 
          he has about a zillion questions. Locke says the have a lot to talk 
          about, but somewhere else. After they leave, we see Julie-Su come out 
          of the building, looking for Knux. Not finding him, she takes off, apparently 
          pissed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We catch up with 
          Locke and son in his jet, as they fly to Haven. Knux asks for an explanation 
          on Haven, and it's purpose. Locke starts to tell the story of Haven, 
          which begins with the Fire-Ants building it as a base of operations 
          for Steppenwolf, the 2nd guardian. SW starts to train his own son Moonwatcher 
          (why do so many Echidnas have weird names?) , all the while doing his 
          duties on the Island. But when the Floating Island gets it's first visitors 
          ever, a groups of Overlanders led by a guy called Brutus Kintobor (an 
          ancestor of Dr Robotik. You now this guy's trouble because of his red 
          and black eyes) They give SW the old "look friendly but be prepared 
          to kill everyone" routine, but some thing goes wrong for them, and they 
          all fall to the ground, writhing in agony and holding their heads, screaming 
          in pain. It appears as if SW has read their thoughts and is now giving 
          them a mental whammy! SW makes the pain stop, as long as their kind 
          leaves the Island and never comes back. After they leave, we find out 
          the psychic tricks were the work of SW's allies, the Fire-Ants. Concerned 
          about the next potential batch of visitors, Christopheles, the ant's 
          liasion with SW, suggests away of dealing with them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We take a small 
          break in the flashback here, as Locke lands his plane and steps out, 
          With Knux following. Our hero admits, for once, that Haven impresses 
          him, and makes him wonder what other secrets he still has to learn, 
          about the Floating Island, and about himself. Locke just gives him a 
          sly smile and the old: "All in due time" line, and continues with the 
          narrative. Christopheles and Steppenwolf decided that more then one 
          guardian was needed to protect the Floating Island, so SW brought his 
          now adult son Moonwatcher (who now looks like Star trek: TNG's Jordi 
          LaForge) to Haven, gave him the guardian badge of honor and told him 
          to watch over the Island while he checked the land the island would 
          fly over for signs of danger. And so it went on, with one guardian on 
          the Island and the other on Mobius Prime (the guardian's term for the 
          rest of Mobius), wiht each one trading off duties every once in a while, 
          so Moonwatcher could interact with the people on Mobius Prime.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This pattern continued 
          like so, while more guardians joined the rank, as Moonwatcher's son 
          Harlan came of age, followed by his own son, Rembrandt, who was the 
          first to christen the group "The Brotherhood", (dispite the fact that 
          nobody was anyone's brother...) until Aaron, Rembrandt's son, made his 
          third visit on Mobius Prime. He stumbled upon a group of Overlanders 
          teamed with Dark Legioneers, who began attacking him. Aaron performs 
          a tactical retreat (RUUNN AWAAAYYYY!!!), but runs into the Overlander 
          leader and Mennicker (who had apparantly gotten out of the zone Steppenwolf 
          trapped him), who are working on a large rocket aimed at the Floating 
          Island. Seeing the enemy, the Overlander leader decides to launch the 
          rocket early. Seeing this, Aaron leaps on the rocket and starts pulling 
          wires. Mennicker leaps on the rocket as it launch and tries to push 
          Aaron off. Aaron responds by detonating the rocket early, blowing them 
          both up!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Locke then tells 
          his son that wasn't the first time a guardian died on duty, but that 
          Edmund, the first, died because he was a scientist, not a soldier (I 
          can see now:"Dammit Christopheles! I'm a doctor, not a fighter!), and 
          was unexperienced in combat. Aaron died because he was reckless. The 
          lost shook not just his father, Rembrandt, but the whole brotherhood 
          as well... things got more complicated when Aaron's brother, Jordan, 
          said he wanted to become a guardian in his late brother's place. (first 
          Aaron, then Jordan as in river Jordan. Do all of Rembrandt's kids have 
          biblical names?) Rem starts training Jordan much like Locke trained 
          Knux, while the rest of the Brotherhood looks on from a distance, making 
          the decision that Jordan receive limits, while having his responsibilities 
          gradually. So Locke didn't abandon his son. He stayed out of sight, 
          allowing Knux to learn self reliance (a little too much for the chaotix's 
          liking...)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Locke says Knux 
          wouldn't be the individaul he is today if he hadn't been given the chance 
          to fail or succed on his own, and that it was more important for him 
          then for any other of Edmund's descendants. When Knux asks for details 
          about that, Locke finally agrees.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Locke once had a 
          nightmare, that seemed so real that he had difficulty distinguishing 
          reality from fantasy for months afterwards; still today, he is unsure 
          wheter or not it was a vision induced by the Ancient Walkers or a precognitive 
          dream about future events. (But we might find out in SSS: Knuckes: Twenty 
          Years later...) He saw his son face a fearful adversary, but before 
          he could learn of the outcome, a blinding flash ended the dream and 
          he would wake up, screaming and sweating. (side note: The adversary 
          Knuckles will face has been seen before: In Sonic Live, the creation 
          of what seems to be a multi-dimensional alliance of Robo-Robotniks. 
          Spooky... I can't wait to see the whole story) Searching for answers, 
          locke turns to the most unlikly source: Athair!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He tells Locke that 
          he did see a vision of the future, a future he may still prepare for. 
          He tells him "To reconcile the past with the present into the next generation"</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What Locke did was 
          use himself as a guinea pig, modifying himself with biological enhancements 
          and other processes, so that the child he would have with Lara-Su would 
          be more then just an ordinary Echidna. the last procedure occured before 
          Knux's egg hatched: In the Chaos chamber, his egg was subjected to a 
          radiation bath with full power rays from the Chaos Emerald, though there 
          had been a lot of argument for and against Locke's plan by the Entire 
          Brotherhood. But Locke knew it had been a success when he saw Knux emerge 
          from his egg. Knux asks how he knew, and Locke shows his his ungloved 
          hands, revealing a normal Echidna hand, without any protuberant knuckles, 
          (the knuckles on his glove are all show) and says that even though he's 
          a guardian, he's still a normal echdina. Knux takes off his own gloves, 
          revealing a normal-looking hand, except for the obvious knuckles (now 
          you know how he got his name). Locke then says (a bit bluntly, for my 
          taste) that Knuckles is every bit the "genetically enhanced offspring 
          [he was] intended to be". When Knux asked why him, it's because Athair 
          said the Brotherhood couldn't fight the future, but Locke could make 
          it's savior. Knuckles.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knuckles, a bit 
          angered asks his father if it occured to him that he might be happier 
          just being his son. Locke argues he went through the same period that 
          Knux went through, just like his own father, and his father before him. 
          Except Kunckles has powers greater then those of any other guardian 
          before him (like his enhaced perception, which allows him to see Espio 
          when he's hiding, his ability to regenerate [K#11], the teleportation 
          gate he made to return to his mother's appartement [K#15], the way he 
          transported the master emerald through time and dimensions back to the 
          Floating Island after it was stolen [SSS#7] and his overload explosion 
          [#24]), powers which he is becoming aware of.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He then tells Kunx 
          of the coice he had to make, betweem sacrificing a world and making 
          a son who could save it. Knuckles gets the point, then asks what they 
          are going to do now. Locke says hat, for now, they should just spend 
          time as father and son. the story ends with Knux telling he father he 
          loves him, and Locke sying likewise. A touching ending.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          I must say, this was a very good issue. Very touching, very intriguing, 
          and very enlightening. We got answers to a lot of questions, and got 
          a few more questions in return: how far back does Robotnik's ancestry 
          go? Were all of his house evil? What is the link between the Dark Legion 
          and the Overlanders? When Robotnik comes back, will he and the DL join 
          forces? What is the true nature of the foe Knuckles will face in the 
          future? How does his destiny tie in with that of Tails (the Turbo-chosen 
          one) and Sonic (destined, according to SSS#8, to be the greatest warrior 
          of all the realities)? I guess we will have to stay tuned to learn those 
          secrets.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 
          Knuckles' origin, I must admit to a bit of disappointment. All the mystery 
          surrouding the nature of his powers have been lifted. And the true nature 
          of the Ancient Walker's involvement is still unknown. But one thing 
          I'm curious about: Locke says he used himself as a guinea pig for his 
          mutation experiments. What are the potential consequences of that? Is 
          there a reason, other than a moral choice, for Locke to refuse to use 
          Chaos Emerald power in though situations, relying instead on his fists 
          and some technology? Well, I'm definetly going to stay tuned, and I'm 
          looking forward to the future issues.</font></p>
