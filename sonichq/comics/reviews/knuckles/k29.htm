          begin this issue, not on the Floating Island, but in Knothole, where 
          Sally is chewing up Antoine for not telling her his part in the retrieval 
          of Prince Elias, since he was under orders. Not getting any answers 
          from him, she decides to take it up with her father. As she asks the 
          king about his apparantly odd behavior (see issues like #55 and #60 
          for exemples), he tells her he's been trying to avert a horrible fate 
          for everyone, but failed. He then sends Sally to perform an important 
          mission, as the solution to many of their problems may be found on the 
          Floating Island...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Which brings us 
          there, as Knuckles is enjoying the scenery from the edge of the Island, 
          away from Echidnapolis, for once. He meets up with an old bird buddy 
          of his, Catweazle, with whom he starts chatting about his ajusting to 
          family life with both his folks. Just as the discussion turns to Lara-Le 
          wan Wynmacher possibly having a child of their own (thus giving Knux 
          a sibling), a familiar hover-pod is seen over the Horizon. The hover-pod 
          ship is piloted by Sally, who is having a conversation with Nicole about 
          the king's behavior, going over his orders to dismantle the robians. 
          It seems he saw them as a potential tool Robotnik Mach2 might us against 
          them, and saw his order as a pragmatic way of elimenating that problem. 
          (Of course, one might argue that Hitler had the same idea, but hey, 
          whatever works...) as she approches the Island, we cut to Haven, where 
          Sabre and Thunderhawk give her the A-Okay to land.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knuckles greets 
          her, but she gives her just as rough a treatement as she gave Antoine. 
          When he tries to diffuse the situation with humor ("Having a bad hair 
          day?"), she goes on to say how she's not one to primp and preen, even 
          after falling into a bath of chemicals years ago, which threw he colors 
          out of whack. That explains very well why the early issues of Sonic 
          showed us a Sally with pink colored fur and black hair. But she goes 
          on saying she didn't like having Knuckles keep the existence of her 
          mother and brother a secret from her. Of course, he didn't know it either 
          at the time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this point, Knuckles' 
          ancestor teleports in, with help from Deo Volente the fireant. He greets 
          the princess and leads her and Knux to Haven. Once there, she is introduced 
          to all the Guardians and is given the grand tour, before she can tell 
          them what her father requests of them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, Knuckles 
          and Locke have a side conversation about how Knux' family secrets seem 
          to hurt his friendship with Sally. Locke argues that, as Sally is princess 
          of her people, her agenda may not fit with his own agenda as a guardian. 
          Her people have always been more open to other cultures, which Locke 
          believes is why they are so often in conflicts with others. Of course, 
          one can attribute this perception to Guardian paranoia.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sally pleads her 
          case before the assembled Brotherhood, asking for help with her mother's 
          condition and against Robotnik (mach 2, as he likes to be called). Spectre 
          says they've done all they could for the queen, but that they can't 
          commit themselves against Robotnik unless her people are willing to 
          use gun-type weapons, which is a major taboo in the kingdom of Acorn. 
          So no help from the Guardians, it seems.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, Knuckles 
          goes to the royal compound on the Island, where Sally has gone, so he 
          could talk with her alone. He tells her he doesn't agree with his elders, 
          but that he doesn't have the clout to make them change their minds. 
          But he still wants to be her friend. The problem is, she's not sure 
          she can stay friends with him anymore, as Knuckles doesn't seem to take 
          any of the chances really needed to preserve that friendship. The fact 
          is, he wouldn't help them fight against Robotnik before, and he won't 
          do it now, most likely. This essentially drives them apart, as she leaves 
          the Floating Island to go back to her people, leaving him to ponder: 
          Sally has valid reasons to ask for support, just as the brotherhood 
          had equally good reasons to deny it. If he had to choose one or the 
          other, which would it be? Could he make that choice with a clear conscience? 
          And if he couldn't, where would that leave him? These questions begin 
          to leave a seed of doubt in Knuckles' mind, which may develop in future 
          issues.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A good storyline, 
          with decent art (Except Spectre looked to darned nice...), and a truly 
          dramatic story. There was some good character growth here, as the Sally/Knuckles 
          friendship is given the final tug that tears it apart to some extent. 
          This leaves us to wonder how future character meet ups will go on, as 
          Sally and Knux now have somewhat conflicting goals: She protects her 
          people and fights Robotnik, and he protects the Island and it's people. 
          These two goals may not always go well together, especially if they 
          both end up competing for a same item that both needs for different 
          purposes. One other element to remember is the old Sonic/Knuckles rivalry. 
          It cooled down some after Robotnik died, but may heat up again, especially 
          since Sally and Knuckles are no longer on such good terms. I guess this 
          opens up possibilities for future issues.</font></p>
