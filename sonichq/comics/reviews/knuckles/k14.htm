          this issue was good if not great!!! However many people found it to 
          be muddled, and with Charmy's fate to compound things there are a lot 
          of negatives with some GLARING pluses on the side. Granted this isn't 
          the greatest of all Knux stories lets remember that there are things 
          worse - namely that goshawful Sonic 33 which just makes anyone want 
          to jump off a cliff after reading it...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyways, onward 
          and forward. Summing this up briefly we open with Charmy renouncing 
          his princehood and running out on his family - The King and Queen Bee 
          and his little sister. After a knock with the butler (complete with 
          Stretch Armstrong limbs, George Washington vest, punch-drunk expression, 
          and looks like he's about to mimic Goofy's a-hyuck noise) Charmy is 
          teased by voices in his head as we pan out to the doc who is saying 
          that things aren't looking good for him...Anywho, cut to Remington and 
          Julie who are heading towards Happyland where we find - Downtown Ebony 
          Hare - Pimp To The Furry Stars, Renfield Rodent - The Walking Infomercial 
          and his pall Ripper, the buffed rat on the cover. Say goodnight also 
          to Ripper as he's knocked woozy in the second panel! The little black 
          hare ain't too happy with Renfield and is about to show him five little 
          fingers that may prove his point....Cut back to the dream sequence where 
          we find Charmy running away from Safron, his "supposed" betrothed and 
          Anime Cutey lookalike and the now deceased Mello just before they set 
          off for Happyland! Charmy now is disgusted with his life in the Strawberry 
          Fields of mobius and is about to take his woes to the one place where 
          he can feel content - The Floating Island !!! There he meets Mighty 
          The Armadillo as a great friendship is about to be made....While the 
          rest of the Chaotix are seemingly back up to par Remington and Julie 
          are in the middle of questioning Renfield who's busy lying through his 
          teeth as usual. In the shadows watches Ebony as he now sets his new 
          plan in motion - Deep Six The Rodent !!! Now lets get to the Namesake 
          of the book....Knuckles! Remeber the blaring lights - Turns out they 
          belonged to The Bear Pack! I'm surprised no one caught this but these 
          guys look EXACTLY like the Bear Pack from Mad Mike Da Bear Warrior in 
          the Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog cartoon.....interesting...Anyways 
          Knux suddenly goes into his own version of a Sonic Spin as Locke and 
          Sabre gawk in amazement from Haven. Now that we have our daily dosage 
          of Knux we find Charmy's gotten worse, Vector wants to put a bite on 
          the nurse, and General Stryker wants to have a "friendly" chat with 
          Harry The Dingo, like it or not, Harry's gonna be more than just a staple 
          character...Up walk Remington and Julie who need Harry to get them to 
          the local thugs hangouts where does Harry take them but to the headquarters 
          of Beejay McThing where we find Julie-Su and Ebony Hare! Julie may have 
          gone undercover but she didn't fool the rabbit for a minute - and as 
          we close Chapter Two we end with julie taking the same kind of fall 
          Sally did in Sonic 47!</font></p>

          this issue was great but it had something missing to it. Granted that 
          there all some muddled moments in the book but hopefully these should 
          be closed by next issue. What really interests me though is the fate 
          of Charmy. This issue lets us know were in for a return of the Bee Family 
          but how will this affect the Chaotix? Next issue: Knuckles 15 and The 
          conclusion to the Chaotix Caper - Say byebye to Charmy!!!! Plus the 
          long awaited return of Knuckles!! </font></p>

          Rings! It had a great story, and a cool plot! It also had a message 
          saying you should never take drugs! I can't wait to see what Downtown 
          Ebony Hare is up to next, and if Julie-Su survives her fall! The Knuckles 
          series just keeps getting better!</font></p>

          Rings. This issue's story was rather muddled but still good. I was confused 
          by Charmy's flashback; at first I thought it was just an LSD-induced 
          hallucination, but I don't think they'd devote seven pages to something 
          like that. Charmy seems to have come off worse than from the LSD than 
          the others. Are bees more sensitive to drugs than other animals? I'm 
          starting to wonder if Charmy isn't going to meet the same fate as Mello 
          (actually, I strongly doubt that). Yes, I'm also interested in seeing 
          if Locke is going to teach Knuckles how to wield his new powers properly. 
          And I LIKE Harry. You got a problem with that?</font></p>

          Rings. Wow! I'm actually quite shocked to find that Sega allowed such 
          a strong subject, like drug use, become a subject dealt with in comics. 
          The story is rather disturbing. See, I attend continuation school, surrounded 
          by drug abuse. I've seen more crack pipes and 'bud' than anyone would 
          ever care to. Still, the title should have been 'Charmy's Story' rather 
          than 'The Chaotix Caper', seeing it's more Charmy's tale than anyone 
          elses. (sniff) I hope you're all enjoying this mini-series, because 
          of what I've heard, it will be Charmy's last.</font></p>
