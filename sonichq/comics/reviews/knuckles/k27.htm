          <b>The First Date - Part Two: &quot;Who Wrote The Book Of Love Anyway?" 
          </b> </font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">H</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ave 
          you noticed the titles in this mini-series are all titles of famous 
          songs about love?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last time, on Dawson's 
          creek... Ooops! Sorry, I meant, in last issue, Julie-Su, angry at Knux 
          bailing on her, got picked up by this guy while shopping, and went on 
          a date, Vector took on a bet with Espio as whether or not he can get 
          a date (hasn't so far...), and Knux, finally admiting to himself he's 
          in love with Julie, retreats to his father, then to Archy, and finally 
          asks for advice about it, thereby showing how limited his advice pool 
          actually is. When we last left him, Archy's advice consisted of teleporting 
          him into the restaurant where Julie is in the middle of her date with 
          Raynor. Not what I'd call a smart move on the part of the ant...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, recap's done, 
          now back to the feature... We meet with Knux, despretly trying to hide, 
          before Julie notices him. He wants to talk to her, but not in that chic 
          place. What follows is an amusing scene as Knux tries frantically to 
          make his way out of the restaurant quietly, but bearly making it before 
          Julie-Su finds him. Later, he and Archy talk a bit about Echindas, romance 
          and the soultouch, before Knux notices the Chaotix going into an Arcade.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, back 
          at the ranch... Sorry, did it again... back at Haven, Locke enters the 
          control room, looking for Knux. There he finds Sabre and two of the 
          fireant council, and tells them Knux just vanished. The ants put two 
          and two together, and tell him Archy's behind it, trying to keep Knux 
          from ending up a lone divorcee like his dad. Locke tells them to relay 
          this message: Next time Knux has romance problems, come to him for advice. 
          As he leaves, someone says "Now, there goes a case of the blind leading 
          the blind!" Too true...I guess Locke could still give Knux advice on 
          what NOT to do, though.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We then meet up 
          with the Chaotix inside the arcade, with Vector bragging he can pick 
          up females as well as he can play videogames. When Espio retorts that 
          Vector still hasn't gotten a date, Vec says he's taking his time (in 
          other words, he's batting zero). Vector starts going a bit sexist, saying 
          picking up a female is like playing a game. Espio then talks about how 
          Knuckles acts around Julie-Su, just as he walks in, out of their view. 
          Vector, mezmerised by the game he's playing, starts bad-mouthing Julie-Su 
          (as usual), which is the straw that finally makes Knux snap. He lunges 
          at the croc, the Chaotix barely holding him back, until Vector finally 
          apoligises, after which our hero just storms off angry, leaving Archy 
          tell the Chaotix: "--That boy is one love-sick puppy" Word up, Archy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, Julie-Su's 
          date, Raynor, is walking her home. They exchange pleasentaries, kiss 
          a bit, then part as Julie enters her home. But although she enjoyed 
          the date, she doesn't seem happy. Raynor's not the guy she wanted to 
          go out with...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knux, the guy she 
          DOES want to go out with is walking along the streets of Echidnapolis, 
          pondering his last actions and, as he walks near his mom's place, considers 
          getting her advice. At the last moment, he changes his mind, and decides 
          to go straight to Julie's. As he does so, we see his mom on the balcony 
          of her apartment, looking down and thinking. Wyn, her fiancee, walks 
          over to her and hugs to give her comfort. She's concerned that she and 
          Knuckles haven't spoken much since she announced her engagement to him, 
          and is worried she's going a bit too fast for him. Wyn says he's ready 
          to wait as long as necessary for this matter to clear up. Okay... Now 
          I see why Lara-Le fell for this guy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back at Julie-Su's 
          place, she's watching what seems to be the Echidna version of "Buffy, 
          The Vampire Slayer", when someone buzzes at her door. It's Knuckles...whom, 
          after a few seconds of tripping on his own words, finally manages to 
          ask Julie-Su out on a date over the Intercom. Both, unaware to the other, 
          is extatic about this development. As Knuckles leaves chest out and 
          all after setting the date and time, he still has no idea what they'll 
          do on that date, nor where they'll go. But from the way Julie-So looks 
          at him from above, I think he could take her to the city dump, she wouldn't 
          care much!</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rating: <img src="../../images/ring.gif" width="16" height="16"><img src="../../images/ring.gif" width="16" height="16"><img src="../../images/ring.gif" width="16" height="16">

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, for my two 
          cents. I must admit, the art's growing on me, even though I still think 
          Julie-Su looks chubby and Espio's face looks weird. I've noticed almost 
          all the echidnas wear those stupid mittens, which shows the artist took 
          a few short cuts. One can wonder what other shortcuts he took. The story 
          well is written, with all the characters believable. Locke clearly seems 
          to want to make up for lost time with his son; Archy's "buttinsky" attitude 
          is in character for that smart-aleky Ant; Vector's loudmouth finally 
          gets him in trouble, and Lara-Le shows great concern for her son, showing 
          readiness to put her own up-coming marriage on hold for him. And, of 
          course, that last scene with Knux walking off, proud of himself, with 
          Julie looking on, is priceless.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mighty 
          The Armadillo - Part Two: &quot;Those Were The Days"</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
          pick up where last issue left off, with Mighty, who does a short recap 
          in his mind: He helps newcomer "Nic" The Weasel locate some gems mined 
          in one of Robotnik's old slave camps, and in return she helps him find 
          his old friend Ray the Squirrel (**NOTE*** Note that Ray has never been 
          seen in ANY Sonic continuity outside of Sonic Arcade. For those that 
          don't know - this will be setting up his first real appearance outside 
          Japan!). But when they get there, he meets someone from his past: Fiona 
          Fox.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First 
          off, I must say, I was WAAAYY off base with my assumptions about Fiona. 
          I thought she might be the "bot version" from the Tails Miniseries story, 
          but this one's the original organic model the 'bot was based on. My 
          apologies. Let us continue...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fiona 
          is apparently pissed off at Mighty and his friends, 'cause they didn't 
          save her life or something... Mighty replies he and Sonic tried to save 
          everyone, but weren't able...Before this argument can continue, Nic 
          tells Fiona to lay off, cause they need Mighty to complete the deal. 
          Seems Nic and Fiona are partners or something. As they enter the camp, 
          Mighty gets another flashback, about the first time he and Ray met Fiona, 
          before she was cartered away from the other prisoners. He and Ray tried 
          to help, but that got them locked in solitary.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
          the trio enter the camp's central building, with all but Nic having 
          second thoughts about it, Mighty suddenly sees replicas of the Freedom 
          Fighters - Sonic, Sally, and Tails! Fiona tells him what they are - 
          Auto-Automatons, and Mighty wonders if that was what that camp was used 
          for. He then remembers that Sonic, who looked like he'd gone 10 rounds 
          with a tank, showed up at his cell, with a card that released his strength-draining 
          shackles, before they both took off to do something, which I think we'll 
          learn more about next issue. As he ends the flashback, wondering if 
          that was the real Sonic or not, Mighty gets called again by Nic, who's 
          found the vault. When Mighty asks about Ray, he's basically told he 
          ain't at this camp. But as soon as she gets what's behind door number 
          one, she'll tell him where he is. As Mighty looks at the vault door, 
          this chapter ends - To be continued...</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          this was a good story as well, but it gets a bit complicated... we now 
          have two Fiona Foxes (which might give Tails a headache, should he ever 
          find out), a missing Ray The Squirrel, more robotic replicas of our 
          favorite heroes, a mysterious vault, and an identity crisis regarding 
          Sonic the Hedgehog...Not exactly a straight-forward story, is it? Let's 
          hope they get this cleared up in the next few chapters. On a good note, 
          the art was great; Manny Galan and Andrew Pepoy do great work! Mighty 
          looks fine, Fiona looks better then ever, and even Nic looks nice. As 
          long as they clear up all those mysteries in the next chapter, I'll 
          be happy.</font></p>
