          I even say that this book passed all my expectations!! After being spoonfed 
          all these excellent 3 parters I thought a single issue story wouldnt 
          hold its weight - Brother was I wrong. This isn't your "Who's The Villian 
          This Issue Book" either....Knux is back and Mommy Lara Le has questions 
          for her kiddo - Like how he got back f'rinstance? Not only that Wynmacher 
          is in attendance as well - And they have a little surprise....Knux tells 
          her and then has a few questions of his own as Lara Le tells Knux of 
          his early childhood ( The Baby Knux picture has been added to the Comic 
          Scans page BTW) We see Locke giving Lara his usual amount of horse pucky 
          as Lara goes to Sabre's wife Jenna - Knux's immediate grandmother for 
          advice on being married to a guardian. Jenna LOOKS happy - But if you 
          look at her eyes they say something different. Something deeper - And 
          now Lara knows that feeling...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the meat of 
          the book starts with the mystery of Haven - The Brotherhood has arrived!!! 
          Seated at a table sits the 6 immediate members minus Hawking who is 
          still in his coma ("Lost Paradise") leading off is Sabre - Knux's grandfather 
          and Locke - Deadbeat Dad of The Decade . And thier first bit of business 
          - Sonic The Hedgehog! We begin with the eldest one - Tobor - Watcher 
          of "The Dragon Kingdom" ("Arsenal Of the Iron King" - Sonic #60).... 
          I AM SO GLAD I READ KNUX 17 before I read this review because it helps 
          something that bothered me in THIS plot to make sense. Call it intuition 
          but I KNEW and now KNOW that Tobor is lying!!! His statement "All is 
          peaceful in the Dragon Kingdom except for Sonic And Tails" is what tipped 
          me off. How do you call two tyrants - The Iron King And The Iron Queen 
          plus a complete burning inferno call Mt. Stormtop that never ends peaceful? 
          For more on Tobor read my review on Knuckles 17....Next we come to Thunderhawk 
          - the ugliest echhidna I have ever seen - I pray that those are not 
          Galan's rendition of echidna "dookey braids" because it looks like he 
          has scales or a nasty case of zits on them. His gripe: the huge mess 
          that Sonic And Tails left in Downunda ("Outback Gut Check" - Sonic #61), 
          next is Sojurner who I'm guessing watches Mercia ("Friendly Rougues 
          And Foul Villians" - Sonic #58) but we never find out as Sabre cuts 
          them off - Sonic isnt the real problem - the problem is that with Doc 
          Robotnik dead and Enerjak reduced to a shriveled pile of old echidna 
          meat, things have gotten crazy all over Mobius as the big villians - 
          Ixis Naugus And The Dark Legion - and the small ones - Robotnik's subbosses 
          are wreaking havoc everywhere. And it is here that the Ant Council - 
          Archimedes, Deo Volente, and Archy's father Semper Fidelis are talking 
          highly of the new "Golden Age"...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surprise One: Cut 
          back to Lara, Wyn and Knuckles. to make things short Lara and Wyn are 
          getting married and wants Knux's blessing - needless to say rad red 
          is not delighted and does something he normally doesnt do - run away...where 
          he runs right past The Chaotix and Julie...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surprise Two: The 
          quiet guardian speaks - Spectre....The all black echidna with the fiery 
          red eyes finally speaks when the topic shifts from Sonic to Knuckles 
          - The guardians are tampering with something they have no business tampering 
          with - Something's seriously up with Knuckles...DUH !!!!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surprise Three: 
          As the book ends Knuckles sits on the docks of a river as julie sits 
          next to them. Its then that Julie and Knux get the first kiss shown 
          above. needless to say Knux has had LITTLE interaction with girls and 
          reacts with a "Why did you go and do that for? I'm not sure I even like 
          you !" Smooth move love doctor... But all is well as we close the book 
          with both wonddering if there really was more to that kiss as they sit 
          beneath a full moon... Beautiful.</font>

          CAN'T be said about this issue that HASN'T been said already. This book

          Kudos To Ken for making me like a book I was thinking would be a dull 
          fest...</font></p>

          Rings! It had a great story, and a cool plot! The art work was really 
          awsome and I like the part when Knuckles as a baby. He looks so cute 
          in his diapers and I like the way he spelled Sega and Stud with his 
          little letter blocks I've got the giggle after seeing that one.</font></p>

          Rings! I thought that part with Knuckles spelling with blocks was so 
          cute too! ^.^ At first I thought he spelled "stud", but if you look 
          at all the letters across, it's actually "Sega Saturn". I can't stop 
          reading Knux#16, I love the whole issue! Especially the end....*grins* 
          Though Knux looked so sad when he found out about Lara marrying Wyn. 
          Yeeee....a mouthful for someone who doesn't usually say much! ;D Byeees</font></p>

          4 big rings. There's a LOT of set-up for future things here: Lara-Le 
          and Wynmacher getting married and Knuckles' reaction to it; Knuckles 
          and Julie-Su developing feelings for each other; and the Brotherhood's 
          dealing with Knuckles and his new powers. We also learned a little about 
          Knuckles' origins (and might I add, he was such a KYOOT baby!)</font></p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Rings. Wow! Let's 
          see why. Ken is actually going to put the bad issues (Sonic #59-61) 
          to use! I can't think of the down part to this other than Lara and Wyn 
          getting married sometime in the future and said right when Knuckles 
          gets home. Uhh... I have to eat lunch now... BYE!</font></p>
