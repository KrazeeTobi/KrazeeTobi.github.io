          <b>The First Date - Part Three: &quot;It Could Be Love (I Should Have 
          Known Better)"</b></font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">kay, 
          I don't know that song, but I guess it must be pretty popular...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We reunite with 
          everyone's favorite Guardian, as he's visiting his mom, trying to get 
          advice about dating from her. Namely, what to do on the date. He asks 
          her what she and Locke did on their first date. Lara Le then reveals 
          a little-known fact about his father, that being that he writes poetry 
          (poetry? from Locke? Who knew?), and her first date with him was wonderful. 
          Hmm... I guess it probably wasn't a "completly" bad mariage... When 
          Knux mentions his date is on Friday, Lara Le suddenly thinks that it'll 
          conflict with her plans for Friday, unless she can do something about 
          it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We then go to Julie-Su's 
          apartment, with our heroine (finally being drawn with a decent figure) 
          welcoming Lara Le inside. The two ladies start to talk, with Lara wanting 
          Julie to help her out with a surprise on Friday, which will make the 
          date unforgettable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We then reunite 
          with the Chaotix, back in that food court from Issue #26, with the guys 
          talking about Vector's attitude towards Julie-Su (three words: Oil and 
          Water), when Knux shows up. Vector resolves to try and be a bit more 
          civil around Julie-Su, that hatchet is buried, and the buds have fun 
          as buds again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We go Locke, watching 
          his son from Haven (as usual), when he gets a call from Lara Le. Here, 
          we learn that Knux's 16th Birthday is this Friday, and that she wants 
          him to attend. Locke and Lara decide to bury their own hatchet for their 
          son's sake.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After one last brief 
          pep talk from Archy, Knux goes to pick up Julie-Su, who says they're 
          going to a poetry recital at the Commons Hall. Knux seems slightly surprised, 
          but goes along. But when they get there, He's surprised to find not 
          a poetry recital...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...But his own Birthday 
          party! After recovering from the shock, he meets up with his parents, 
          who aren't getting back together, but will nonetheless be there to give 
          him support. He then goes back to Julie-Su, who's dressed in a fetching 
          slinky black dress, by the way, and sets up a date for next week, which 
          he seals with a kiss so fine, I've only seen it topped by the kiss Sonic 
          gave Sally in Sonic#50, Director's cut. And our story ends here.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, this was a 
          pretty good issue. I still find it disappointing that the artist only 
          finally managed to do a decent Julie-Su at the end of his run in the 
          book... Same thing happened with Jim Valentino, by the way... The story 
          was kewl too, as it had the characters actually acting nice to one another! 
          Imagine! I mostly like the way Knux's parents actually decided to out 
          the differences aside for their son's sake.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mighty 
          The Armadillo - Part Three: &quot;Below The Belt"</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          Back-up story, "Below the Belt", was honestly a bit boring... it's partly 
          an explanation of some mysteries, (where's Ray been? stuck in a zone 
          where time nearly stood still for him; what became of Fiona? after Robo 
          made that duplicate of her seen in S #28-29, he left her in that camp, 
          with only the 'bot maintenance to sustain her, until she made her break 
          for it two years later; why didn't Sonic and Mighty rescue her? they 
          saw Robo haul her duplicate in his escaoe shuttle and thought she was 
          gone), but some other things are just confusing (Time was sped up for 
          Sonic and Mighty first time around inside the zone: They pop in one 
          panel, and pop out the next, talking about a wild ride; but time practically 
          stood still for Ray in all those years)</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think 
          the back story was unnecessarily complicated, but it did serve it's 
          primary purpose: Explain Ray's link to both Mighty and Sonic, as well 
          as his whereabouts for the last 9-8 years in the comics, as well as 
          explain Fiona's past and introducing us to Nic the weasel. I'm sure 
          we'll be seeing more of Fiona and Nic, as the first has a link to the 
          Sonic books through her duplicate's involvement with Tails, and the 
          second has, since her appearance two months ago, has become a fan favorite 
          almost overnight.</font></p>
