<TD>Yo, I'm WB and I maintain the Comics and Games page here at HQ. I'm a college kid and I major and am VERY VERY heavily into animation both western and japanese. I'm a good artist (I drew a lot of work you see on the site - icons and other stuff)I'm also pretty cool at videogames (though you can tell which series is my obvious favorite). >;) Hit me up on AIM if you can. Peace out!</TD>

<TD>J Weekley. I'm 17 years old. I'm a fanfic writer who's series is loosely based off SatAM. I also like other sci-fi and fantasy (yes, I consider Sonic to be sci-fi), and I have a pretty active imagination. I am currently the sole director of the Yet-To-Be-Launched Shrine of Chaota Company, which will showcase my Sonic stories, as well as two of my original series. Got anything intelligent to talk about, don't hesitate to contact me. I should let you know that I'm a librarian, and I get really annoyed when there are a bunch of books that some idiot let just sitting there on the shelf, so I may not be in the best of moods right after work. Give me some time to calm down first, then we can talk. (BTW, I love discussing fanfic).</TD>

But we all know Sonic kicks ass, that's why we're here. Contact me if you wish to know the amusing story behind my name (It's Mayan, I believe). I'm a slug-man!

<TD>What's up ya'all?  I've been a fan of Sonic since I played the originals for Genesis, and though I just recently started collecting the comics last year, I'm already a fan of those as well!  Anyways I'm creating a Sonic Fanfic Spin-Off site, Mecha Desotryer Headquarters (<a href="http://www.mechadestroyers.com/" target="_blank">www.mechadestroyers.com</a>), check it out sometime, I could use more visitors.  I'm always available to chat, so feel free to make yourself known!</TD>
