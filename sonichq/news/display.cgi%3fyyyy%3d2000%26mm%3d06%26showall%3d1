It has been rumored that the transfer of ownership of the domain <a href="http://www.sonicteam.com" target="_blank">Sonicteam.com</a> between Sierra Ranay and the Sonic Team is somehow fraudulent. Now, <a href="http://sonic.sega-zone.com" target="_blank">TSSZ</a> is even holding a public poll on it. I, for one, am convinced that it is totally legit - and I can prove it. To see for yourself, click <a href="http://www.totalnic.net/whois.html" target="_blank">here</a> <font size=-1>(link opens in new window)</font> for a NIC Whois lookup form. If you enter Sonicteam.com, you'll see that the ownership of the domain IS, in fact, of Yuji Naka.

<div class=itemtext>
Here's what Ken said at his site: <p> "<i>This is what the reality is... Sega wants to do an animated  project, preferably a film. Ben wants to do something that  incorporates his ideas that would have been used in third  season of SatAM had ABC gone through with it. (Incidentally,  my then partner Mike and I had a couple of story pitches  ready to go at the request of Sega ready to go if that had  happened.) Ben and I have spoke on the subject, and he feels  the Archie version should be acknowledged to some extent  because it has been carrying the torch for Sonic these past  seven years or so. My involvement -- if any -- won't occur  until Ben has at least put together his first draft. The big  however is getting someone to commit to the financing first,  because it makes no sense to write a script, get an  animation studio revved up, and then have no place to go.<p>If anything, the more  obvious choice for an AMERICAN-made film if it weren't based  on the SatAM or Archie series is the plotline for Sonic  Adventure, which would distress the Sally fans, as there  would be no Sally, and Amy Rose would probably be reworked  into the love interest.</i>"<br><hr><p>I don't know about you, but I don't like the idea of having a SatAM/Archie crossver. Archie's too different from SatAM. I mean, just look at Naugus. His character is ten times different in the comic. Maybe having Knuckls in the movie would be nice however.<br>

<p>   Hey, everyone! Bug here with some important (well, important to me at least :P) news:</p> <p>   As some of you might know me, I started a fan-made "furry" video game back in March '99 called "Bug Tilahe Hedgehog: Mixed Up And Lost!?" (MUAL for short). I've been surfing around the 'net lately, mostly looking at fan-made games. And I feel like my game has been neglected way too long. I have been inspired to start working on it again. So now, for the past few days I have been making a section of my site dedicated to just that one game. I decided to also include the first public release of the game, and so I am asking you, the viewer, to come on over and check it out if you're bored! ;)</p> <p>Site Link: <a href=http://members.tripod.com/bugposs/>The Page of Sonic Stuff</a><br> Game Link: <a href=http://members.xoom.com/_XMCM/CMikeska/Projects/MUAL/index.html>Project: MUAL</a></p><br>

<div class=itemtext>
It's Sunday night, and you know what that means.  After spending some time with your dad, it is time for the news from me.    <p>We start with potentially major news from the man himself.  In a recent interview with GameWEEK magazine, Yuji Naka openly stated that developing for any platform is possible now that the Sonic Team is financially independent from Sega and reports to CSK Enterprises.  Here is a quote from that interview:  <p><i>My main focus is Dreamcast, but Sonic Team is separating from Sega, so anything is possible...I do not think very highly of PlayStation 2. There have been many problems with it. With Dolphin and X-Box, however, there is a possibility. Who knows? If I did decide to do something outside of Dreamcast, I would be inclined to go in that direction, yes.</i>  <p>These are potential words of change from Naka; now there is a chance that the Sonic series could also go on rival consoles.  If and when that does happen, we will tell you.  <p>This week has been one of many donws for the Sega fan sites primarily; first UK Resistance was pulled from Telefragged due to its questionable content, then Perfect Zero, a site mainly known for its vast MP3 collection was down for a time late last week.  Now, the DC Tech Pages, a major source of Sega news and opinions, has been down for the past three days.  Details as to why this has occured are unknown, and when it might return is not known also.  <p>JD Harding has finally decided to take a 'vacation', after The Sonic Corner is finally running smoothly.  He still encourages you to submit any music and Sonic Network sites, as he will review them upon his return.  Keep in mind, though, that a few weeks back Harding decided to go on leave, and promptly returned a few days after the announcement.  <p>Also on the vacation front, Artie of Team Artail will be going to see his sister graduate, so do not expect an update from him until mid-week.  <p>And finally, Andy Wolan of our parent site Emulation Zone has set up a video game music station, and he has big plans for it!  You can find out more by clicking <a href="http://www.emulationzone.org/updates/index.htm#961136946">here</a>  <p>That is it from me for now.  The RA News will pop up sometime week, so check back here for that.  Have a great week.  <br>

<div class=itemtext>
It is a hot day where I am right now, I hope that you are better off, though.  In any case, here is your news this Sunday:  <p>SonKnuck sent me a few tidbits; the first being that the Dreamcast, specifically, bleem!, is being featured in a French version of TV Guide.  Here is a snippet of that article:  <p><i>....what's making talk is the release by Bleem of an emulator for  Playstation games on the Dreamcast. This product allow to play hundreds of  Playstation games on Dreamcast. Of course, Sony doesn't like it, since one  product of Playstation 2 is the compatibility with Playstation 1 games. The witnesses of the demonstration says that Playstation games are ameliored a lot by the power of the Dreamcast.</i>  <p>Also from SonKnuck, his project Secrets: All Sonic might be delayed further due to school issues.  Progress has slowed to a near standstill.  If worse does come to worse, SonKnuck will attempt to find someone to take over the project.  <p>JD Harding has launched <a href="http://www.ncreation.com/">Northwest Internet Creations</a>, a new website design business he has planned.  JD says that he will most likely use the profits he gains from the company to buy more music equipment, and means more original and remixed Sonic music for us.  <p>And finally this week, the Space Channel 5 promotions have begun in the United States.  However, the new commercials airing on television have kept the uniform <b>It's Thinking</b> ad campaign Sega of America is using, and that is leaving some veteran gamers out in the cold.  They do not like the commercial, mostly because of the severe lack of in-game footage...again.  Gamers believe that this leaves casual gamers confused as to what the game actually is about.  Most agree that Sega should change their ways before losing a considerable chunk of a potential gaming audience.  <p>That is it for now, I will be back next week at the same time, and I hope to see you then.<br>

<HTML>  <IMG SRC="http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0006/07/sonic89.jpg"><P>  Archie has released the preview of Sonic 89.  Above is the cover, and telling the plot line for this issue, it looks like the events in 88 will have some pretty big effects.  The plot follows...<P>  Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders, art by James Fry, Andrew Pepoy, Steven Butler and Pam Eklund.<P>  "Thicker Than Water." The heroes deal with the disastrous results of last issue's major turmoil, and in the process face their own inner turmoil as well. Princess Sally is among the hardest hit, keeping a vigil for her ailing father, King Max - while Sonic blames himself for King Max's condition. Meanwhile, Robotnik has returned to see the damage his headquarters has suffered. Marshaling forces of Shadow Bots and Robians, he plots his revenge, even as Sonic ponder the Sword of Acorns' alleged ability to restore the Robians' own free will. In a backup story, Knuckles and friends  return to Albion, where many surprises await them - including Antoine discovering his father there.<P>  Well, this definitely sounds interesting.  The back story sounds of particular interest to me, especially with the mystery of Antoine's dad possibly starting to clear up, epsecially because of Antoine's growing fan base.  Looks like Archie's starting to clear quite a few things up now, with Rotor in 85 and now Antoine and his dad in 89... <P>  Credit:<A HREF="http://www.comicscontinuum.com/">Comics Continiuum</A>  </HTML>              <br>

The bad news is they said they terminated my site so I think it's gone for good, but the good news is everything is on my hard drive with the exception of the Weird yet True Screenshots and the Hoaxes.... sorry about that guys who sent all those in.  But anyway, there is going to be a new site launching very soon.<br> If you're wondering how so soon it's because I anticipated webhost.fm would shut me down because they were coming down on many other sites for stupid reasons so I have been working on it for a while.  I was just hoping they would wait until I was done.<br> I can't give you the address yet, but the new will have the best of PC... and the worst of PC... and a whole lot more, so be prepared.  I'll keep you posted and hopefully the members of SHQ don't mind me using their board for this.<br>

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
