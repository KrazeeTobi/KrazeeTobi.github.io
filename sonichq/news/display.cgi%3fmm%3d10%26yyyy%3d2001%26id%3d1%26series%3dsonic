<div class=itemtext>
<a href="http://pocket.ign.com/" target="_blank">Pocket IGN</a> has a report with details on how the Game Boy Advance and GameCube titles interact in terms of the Chao for <i>Sonic Advance</i> & <i>Sonic Adventure 2 Battle</i>. <p>Sonic Advance's Petit Garden  <p> Sega releases screenshots and details on how the Game Boy Advance and GameCube titles interact. <p>  In anticipation of the company's showing at Tokyo Game Show next week, Sega has revealed exactly how its two Nintendo-based Sonic the Hedgehog games will interact with each other. Through the use of the GameCube/Game Boy Advance link, players will be able to upload and download data between the two systems and the two games <i>Sonic Adventure 2 Battle</i> for the GameCube and <i>Sonic the Hedgehog Advance</i> for the GBA. <p> Players will collect Chao eggs in both games, which can then be taken to the Chao Garden (GameCube) or the Chao's Petit Garden (Game Boy Advance) and raise them to be the best Chaos they can be. They can then be sent to the GameCube for the Chao Races, and they'll perform based on how well you've raised them.  <p> Players raise Chaos by buying fruit and seeds with the rings they collect in the Game Boy Advance main game and two minigames, "Okashi Mekucchao" and "Janken Shoot." Their appearance will change depending on which Sonic character is involved in the upbringing, as well as what items have been used to raise them. There are some eggs that can only be obtained in the Game Boy Advance <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>, an element which encourages players to play the portable game as well as the GameCube adventure. <p> Although Sega is claiming that this is the first time software for different formats have been linked, the company fails to recall that the NeoGeo Pocket Color and the Sega Dreamcast interfaced similarly with <i>King of Fighters</i> and <i>SNK vs. Capcom</i> for both systems. <p> Both Sonic games will be released in Japan on December 20th. Sega of America hasn't yet revealed the official dates for the games in the US. <p> -- Craig Harris <p> Source: <a href="http://pocket.ign.com/news/38844.html" target="_blank">Pocket IGN</a>

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
