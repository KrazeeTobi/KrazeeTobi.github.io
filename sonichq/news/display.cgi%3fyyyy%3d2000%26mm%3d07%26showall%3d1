The last issue of "Sonic the Comic" to feature an original story is now on sale. It will be available until 11 July 2000. This is effectively the death of the comic. Future stories will feature an original cover by Richard Elson, accompanied by reprint material selected by current Managing Editor Steve MacManus. <P> COVER (features spoiler): <A HREF="http://freespace.virgin.net/ed.reynolds/stc/stc184a.jpg">http://freespace.virgin.net/ed.reynolds/stc/stc184a.jpg</A> <P> <STRONG>POINT OF NO RETURN</STRONG> <BR> Script: Nigel Kitching <BR> Art: Richard Elson <BR> Lettering: Ellie De Ville <P> Robotnik has lured the terrible Chaos creature to his mountain retreat and gathered the Chaos Emeralds allowing him to grow into the almighty Perfect Chaos. Despite the pleas of assistant Grimer, it is clear that Robotnik has NO PLAN - he has gone completely insane and believes he is setting up the end of the world. He may be right. Sonic, Knuckles, Tails and Amy seemed to be at the mercy of Perfect Chaos when Super Sonic and Ebony arrived. A far cry from his days as a world-destroying demon of incredible Chaos energy, Super Sonic's energy is now almost up and he needs the Chaos Emeralds to regenerate. He leaps into Perfect Chaos, a clash of the Chaos creatures that need the Chaos Energy to survive. PICK UP THE LATEST ISSUE FOR THE STUNNING CONCLUSION!

<b>Sonic Underground To Make A Comeback?</b> - WB 21:57 pm 07-01-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<img src=http://www.sonicunderground.net/episodes.jpg align=right><p>The SU Rumor mill is stirring and it seems Sonic Underground may be poised to make a return - but sadly, for its American and English fans, the American version may not be coming back anytime soon...  <p>The Sonic Underground mailing list has been getting reports that either 40 new episodes or the myserious "Lost 25 Episodes" as noted by Ben Hurst earlier in its inception may be in production for a premier in South Africa and POSSIBLY in Australia. These two countries are the only two currently showing it <b>regularly</b> as its only shown in the US sporadically on Toon Disney and on again off again on Diggit in the UK and YTV in Canada. South African commercials are supposedly saying that a new season is on the way - where the toon is said to have had its best  popularity. Ben said months ago that there were 65 written episodes, but only 40 showed here in America (65 is the regular syndication packet for a show, 40 for syndicators that want it cheaper). The remaining episodes were dubbed by SU fans as "the Lost 25", and if theres any full truth to the story - then the Lost 25 would be in the new season. We'll see when South Africa does its premieres. ^_^  <p>We havent heard from Ben Hurst on the situation, but then again he may not know. We'll send him an email asking him - but overall it would be a decision made by DiC and Sega. The policy of not premiering a cartoon in the origin of the country it was produced in (SU was produced in France, so it would make more sense to premiere it in France or Europe altogether) is not practiced very often, but it has been known to be done before. We'll keep you posted more on the subject as we find out. And if this does mean the premier of "the Lost 25" in another country it brings up much questions concerning the new rumored Sonic cartoon as well as the status of SU in America and England....  <p>We'll keep you posted! ^___^  <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=mailto:s_underground.listbot.com>Sonic Underground Mailing List</a> <br>

<b>Sega Changes Advertising Campaign</b> - WB 16:36 pm 07-01-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<p>In lieu of recent events concerning Sega's ANYTHING BUT ad campaign - it seems Sega is going back to the good old humor of thier old ads.  <p>People had recently complained that Sega's ads just werent cutting it. Sonic Adventure and Resident Evil got decent coverage ad wise, but it had seemed that on Television and other ads of print medium, Sega had been giving its games the short shrift - specifically with the recently realeased Space Channel 5 and upcoming Seaman.  <p>After Space Channel 5, only two 'In the Box' ads remain, World Series Baseball 2K1 and Seaman; the new commercials, beginning with NFL 2K1's this fall, will retain the trademark Sega humor, but will focus on the gameplay and quality of Sega's wonderful lineup. Sega acknowledges that two to three seconds of in-game action just isn't enough, and plans to sort out a mix of around 50% gameplay, 50% new ad concept per thirty-second spot. Naturally, the company's hesitant to reveal its new concept so early, but it's said to be flexible enough to keep the comedy for some games but approach others straightforward. Case in point--Sega already plans to sell Shenmue more like a movie than an actual game, sporting perhaps a trailer-esque mix of voiceovers, in-game action and cut-scenes.<br>

<div class=itemtext>
<img src=images/changes.jpg align=right><p>Sonic Super Special #14 spoilers are light in this post - so beware if you haven't gotten it.   <p>For those that don't already know, as we posted last week, Sonic Super Special #14 was released Wednesday and has already met with some numerable discussion on its day of release. With this book Ken Penders has seemingly wiped away all of Knuckles continuity in one big stroke! I wont spoil it any further than that, but so far a lot of people have been VERY happy with this one (minus the short Zone Wars story), as this story has reset Knuckles to his roots presented when he was first introduced. Now Ken Penders wants your feedback on how it went and what you thought. As he posted on his message board:  <p><i>I thought for sure with all the clamoring for Knuckles to get his own book again that I'd hear more commentary -- pro or con -- regarding SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #14. I put it everything but the kitchen sink just to let everyone know no matter what the format, I'm still able to make the stories a continuation of what has gone on before. </i>  <p>So head over to KP's message bard and tell him what you thought of the decison to "wipe the slate clean" so to put it. Was it achieved well, or done badly?

<b>Sonic Adventure 2 - Worldwide Release; Sonic Shuffle Net None?</b> - WB 14:59 pm 07-01-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<p>The word seems to be going around that Sega and Sonic Team are planning for a worldwide simultaneous release of <b>Sonic Adventure 2</b> on December 10, 2000.   <p>And in other news - recently Gaming Age and other websites posted a story that said Sonic Shuffle would have no internet capabilities whatsoever. Well thanks to Sega X, this story has been rightfull debunked and this is what they had to say....  <p><i>The rumor behind Sonic Shuffle's online support has just gotten even stranger. Earlier today our Sega PR contact e-mailed apologizing for yesterday's information. She then told us that, "There are no internet capabilites in the game [Sonic Shuffle]. Sorry about the confusion." To be doubly sure, we contacted Sega a second time for re-confirmation, and ultimately, what we discovered was not uplifting. As it now seems, Sonic Shuffle will not be bundled with on-line capabilities, corroborating the company's official link for the game, which originated this controversy.   <p>Originally, Sonic Shuffle was announced to come with networking support as one of SegaNet's primer titles this Fall. </i>  <p>And what does www.sega.com have to say about it - they still have full net support up. :OP So we'll see what happens when it happens    <br>

<div class=itemtext>
<a href="http://www.dailyradar.com">Daily Radar</a> has just posted what they think to be their top 100 games/series of all time.  While most of them deserve to be there, they completely ignored some of the more insanely good Sega franchises.  Sonic clocked in at 19th place, far below Mario (1st), Metal Gear (2nd), as well as Tetris (6th), Street Fighter (10th), Pac Man (11th), Tony Hawk (12th), and Half-Life (15th).  This is what they had to say about the Sonic Series:<br><br> <i>While this series is certainly nowhere near as deep as the platform originator Mario, go back and play it today and you'll find a solid, highly enjoyable platform game. Nintendo may have been the innovator, but Sega polished the concept to a new level with the Sonic series.</i><br><br> Hmph.

<hr>
<font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog Advance</b> - The <u>first</u> Segasonic videogame on a Nintendo system - has been confirmed for the Game Boy Advance.</font> The game is reported to be along the lines of the Genesis 2D sidescroller, featuring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, with brand new levels unique to the Nintendo system. The game is currently scheduled for a worldwide release with the US system this July. Also confirmed have been "Puyo Puyo" and Sonic Team's "Chu Chu Rocket".
<hr>
<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
<hr>
<font color=red>Sega has confirmed that it is stopping production on all Dreamcasts and will be moving on to develop for other systems.</font> Theres a _LOT_ to this story and if you wish to learn more you can read the reprinted article and discuss your opinions on the situation at The Station Square Newsboard. The link to the full story & discussion can be found <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fsonichqcommunitystationsquarenewsandeditorials.showMessage?topicID=181.topic>here.</a>
<hr>
<font color=red>The landmark 100th issue of Archie Comic's "Sonic The Hedgehog" will be out, August 2001.</font> Titled "Darkness Falls", one of the main characters - a good guy - will go bad and become the "Ultimate Villian". The preview cover of Sonic #100 suggests it's Knuckles, but it MAY be a fake cover.
<hr>
Reasaurus Toys are currently in the process of making thier <font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog - Series 3 Toy Line</font>. Characters will come from Sonic Adventure 2 and will consist of Sonic, Shadow, and Rouge. No other figures or a release date is known at this time.
