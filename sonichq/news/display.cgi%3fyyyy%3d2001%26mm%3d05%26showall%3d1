What kind of information, you ask? Multiplayer modes, of course! <p> <b>Sonic Adventure 2</b><br> We already knew that Sonic Adventure 2 would have multiplayer games, as we played a few of them at Sega's booth at E3. However, what we didn't know is that one of the games would be kart racing! Yes indeed, boys and girls. A new kart racing multiplayer game will be added to the final version. Also, in regards to chaos, collecting them will in fact open up hidden game features and mini-games. Perhaps the chao side quests will be worth it this time around, hmm? <p> <b>Sonic the Hedgehog Advance</b><br> In our fresh-off-the-presses Sonic the Hedgehog Advance screenshots story, we revealed to you a picture where you play as Amy, a character introduce in Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast. To elaborate on this, Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy will all be playable in the final game. Could this be the biggest 2D Sonic game yet?  <p> Also, Sonic the Hedgehog Advance will also support multiplayer games between multiple Game Boy Advance. While details on the games haven't been fully revealed to us yet, we do know that there will be a Chaos Emerald Hunt and Battle mode. <p> More as we receive it!</i> <p> <b>Source:</b> <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://www.segadojo.com target="_blank">Sega Dojo</a><br>

<b>Bleem Accusing Sony of Blocking Their Products</b> - Bumper 17:33 pm 05-23-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
At it Sony and Bleem go again...<P>  <I>In a press release today released by Bleem, Inc., Bleem! has filed a motion to the US District Court for the Northern District of California blaming Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA) for interfering with the marketing and sales of Bleem's new product, "Bleem! For Dreamcast". The motion filed accused SCEA of unlawfully using its market power to strong-arm retailers via threats of legal action and harm to their business dealings with the company. The motion claims that as a result of Sony’s coercion, Babbages stopped distribution of Bleemcast to its stores and asked to return nearly all of its 7,000-unit initial order. "Sony has already asked the judge to pull bleem! from the market in three separate motions, and each time, they’ve lost," stated David Herpolsheimer, president and CEO of Bleem. "This is nothing more than an end-run around the justice system – Sony is using its huge market power to force retailers into giving them what the courts won’t."<P>  Released on May 2 of this year, Bleem claims that when Electronics Boutique initially carried bleem! for Dreamcast, it sold out of its 11,000 units in barely a week. It quickly became the number-one best-selling product across all gaming platforms on the ebgames.com website, outselling even the highly-anticipated Gran Turismo 3 title and the PlayStation 2 console. However, Bleem claims that pressure from Sony halted reorders and Bleemcast! was temporarily removed from the site. We have yet to get a comment from SCEA, though hopefully we'll be able to speak with someone at SCEA about Bleem's claims later on this week. Stay tuned for more.<P></I>  And next, on Springer, game companies that'll never stop fighting...<P>  Credit: <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://dreamcast.ign.com/">DCIGN</A> <br>

Sega had better hope the news is better next year... <P>  <I>As expected, Sega reported a record net loss in its past fiscal year ended March 31, hit by a hefty charge from scrapping inventories of its loss-making Dreamcast, Reuters reports. <P>  The company posted a loss of about $421.9 million for the year, compared to last year's loss of about $349.5 million. Sales dropped 28 percent to about $1.9 billion. <P>  Sega's poor year marks its fourth loss in a row. However, the company's CEO Shunichi Nakamura said Sega expect to make a small profit of about $17 million in this fiscal year, thanks in large part to it focusing on software for other platforms. </I> <P>  Maybe there IS a little light at the end of the tunnel as far as Sega's financial woes go.<P>   Credit: <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://www.gamers.com/home">Gamers.com</A> <br>

<b>Yet More on Sonic Advance</b> - Sonique Hedgehog 22:25 pm 05-18-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
This is from E3 I think:<br> Sega&#8217;s booth was closed to the general public, but that didn&#8217;t stop us from getting through the guarded doors to get a first-hand look of the first Sonic game to ever hit a Game Boy system -- Sonic the Hedgehog Advance. <br><br> The game wasn&#8217;t playable, but it was running on Game Boy Advance hardware through a Wide Boy AGB device (you know, the development cartridge that enables developers to play GBA titles on an N64 and a television) as a self-running demo. And man, it was slick.  <br><br> The Game Boy Advance title, developed by Dimps, is based on the classic side-scrolling design, but it&#8217;s a game all its own. Sonic can run and jump, as well as spin-dash to get himself out of specific binds. Collecting rings is still the name of the game, and when you get hit by specific enemies, dozens of those golden &#8216;o&#8217;s go flying&#8230;showing off the GBA&#8217;s sprite handling capabilities. The game is super-fast as it should be, and there are plenty of corkscrews and loops to make players going dizzy. <br><br>  But that&#8217;s not all &#8211; the game also borrows from the second Dreamcast adventure &#8211; Sonic can now &#8220;grind&#8221; down rails in several places in the game. Though the demo only showed one instance of this feature, it was a lot of fun to watch. The graphics have also been completely redone, giving the hedgehog an edgier look to his classic design. And the pictures that Sega has given us show that you&#8217;ll also play as several different characters as well &#8211; Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy will be in the player lineup. And, like a good GBA game, it will support the four player link for multiplayer mini-games. <br><br>  <b>The game&#8217;s being prepped for a November 2001 release.</b> <br>

<div class=itemtext>
<I>I'm starting the WHO'S WHO pages in SONIC #101 with Princess Sally and the Floating Island, followed up by Robotropolis and Dimitri in SONIC #102. After that, I figure you guys will really be rolling in with the suggestions. So far, Mina seems to be the heavy favorite <br><br> Sonic is at least 16 pages in SONIC #100, while Knuckles is 10. <br><br>  I can't say regarding Tails and Robotnik, because of what happens in SONIC #97. <br><br>  I'm going to be dealing in some capacity regarding K20YL during the next year. <br><br>  Archie has pretty much most issues available for order. <br><br>  You'll have to ask Karl why (Mina is) a mongoose, as I was not in that. <br><br>  I'm not sure yet at this juncture when and how the K20YL storyline will be incorporated just yet. All I can say is that it will be. <br><br>  I did the first drawings of Lara-Su at last year's San Diego comic convention. <br><br>  I think there's a lot we haven't learned yet about Tails, so you'll have to wait and see. <br><br>  Sonic is an only child, just like Knuckles. <br><br>  SA2 comes out in June, just not sure when, (JUNE 19TH) and SONIC #98 is supposed to come out a week later. <br><br>  Whether or not Lara-Le and Wynmacher have a bundle of joy is another matter, one I haven't decided upon yet. <br><br>  Knuckles won't be in SONIC #102 and 103 at this point, as Justin is going to be using an inventory story. <br><br>  Basically, as I am writing and drawing the Knuckles stories, Justin wanted to give me a break in order to allow me to get ahead of schedule, and he didn't want anyone else doing Knuckles at this point. <br><br>  I'm also considering doing a talent search, looking for an assistant who can either help me update this website or one who might be able to help me out with the pencilling or inking. The old artists are working on other things, and I'd rather work with new talent I can train. Anyone interested please e-mail me basic info about yourself and what you're interested in doing, and what your talents are. Anyone wishing to e-mail me can do so at Sonic@kenpenders.com or KenPenders@kenpenders.com. Before anyone thinks this is a full time job, it's far from it. <br><br>  I described the new requirements for submitting fan art in the editorial for SONIC #98. <br><br>  We didn't wish to create a new character, and always felt it made more sense for Robo-Robotnik to become the new Robotnik than any other solution. <br><br>  I've been working on SONIC since #11, and I've been enjoying it for the most part. <br><br>  The original Robotnik is dead. We have no plans, NONE, to ever bring that version back. <br><br>  I haven't read karl's script for SONIC #101, but the Knuckles story definitely affects Sonic and friends without Knuckles being anywhere near them. <br><br>  Spaz is a real big fan of anime, and Justin has asked me to incorporate more anime style elements into my Knuckles work as well. <br><br>  Spaz worked on the Sonic story for #98, and he may yet do that Sonic project him and I were planning for the Super Specials. <br><br>  I'd like to hear what direction you guys think we should go in regarding the comic <br><br>  You'll find out about Tobor and Kragok within the next few issues.</i> <br><br>  <b>In addition:</b><p> <i>Speaking of conventions, I'll be at San Diego in July, Toronto in August and Boston in October. I may be in NYC in June, but I haven't confirmed that one yet. If i do NYC, it'll be the one in Madison Square garden.</i><p><i>I was referring to Tails' uncles in SONIC #95</i> [seems that Tails has a larger family than we know about]<p><i>The characters from SA2 are up in the air as far as future use goes.</i><p>Source: <A href="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://www.kenpenders.com" target="_blank">Ken's Comic Book Stories and Art</a>        <br>

It's not my place to say this, but please, don't post things that are rumors on the board. This has been said alot around here, I know, I've seen it happen alot.<p> For one, the Dreamcast 2 Issue was dated BEFORE the announced end of the Dreamcast. And above all, it is a rumor, and it's clearly stated in the rules of this news poster, which are directly above me as I type, <i>Please don't post opinions, news rebuttals/corrections, or <b>rumors</b> here. </i><p>  Again, it's not my place to say any of this, I know, and I wouldn't be suprised if somebody like Vec or somebody else tells me just to but out. But this place is 2nd to TSSZ to me, and I dislike seeing it cluttered with rumors or things that were already posted or known. (Like the "New Sonic Adventure 2 Trailer" -- the demo's been out for months, of course we know about the movie by now)<p>  Anyways, I'll shut up now, and get back to studying for my drivers test. Have a nice day, all.<br>

<b>Sonic Adventure 2 showed in London</b> - PSMad 14:36 pm 05-06-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Yesterday in London, Sega showed off the Sonic Adventure 2 preview version in a number of Dreamcast demo pods near 'Miss Selfridges' in Oxford Street. This event drew a huge number of eager Sonic fans all dying to get their hands on the game and play a more complete version than the SA2 Trial. The version of the game was the one doing the rounds on WebPages (such as IGN) and Magazines where you could pick the side of Good or Evil. But only the first level for each character was playable. I personally was unable to attend the event but I gathered this information from a London radio station which was covering the event, as well as other happenings around the Oxford Street area.<br>

Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it.
