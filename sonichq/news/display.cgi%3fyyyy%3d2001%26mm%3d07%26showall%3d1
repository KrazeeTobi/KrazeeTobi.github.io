<b>No PSO At Launch for GameCube, Apparently.</b> - Bumper 10:23 am 07-31-01

<div class=itemtext>
Well, this news may disappoint some, but at least this is for a good reason...<P>  <I>Although Phantasy Star Online would most likely be completed by GameCube's launch, Naka-san is reconsidering having the game as a launch title. The reason is that Nintendo's online plans will not be set in stone yet, leaving the user without online capabilities - which as you know is a major part of the game. Props to <A HREF="http://www.g-rev.com/">CCB's Game Review</A> for the scoop. </I><P>  The page mentioned above is in Japanese, just so you know.

<b>Peter Moore Comments on Sonic/Mario Game Rumors</b> - Bumper 10:13 am 07-31-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
The following somewhat major news is from SegaWeb:<P>  <I>We've been reporting for months about the rumors that Sega and Nintendo have teams working on a title featuring the companies respective mascots, Sonic and Mario. After a long silence, Peter Moore has commented on the matter to IGN. <P>  "I think that's just wishful thinking," he said about the rumored project. "But if I got a phone call at four o'clock this afternoon from Japan that said they were doing it, it wouldn't surprise me in the least. We have a great relationship with NCL all the way to Yamauchi-san, who has great regard for Sega and what we've done over the years. There is also an incredible mutual respect, particularly between Naka and Miyamoto. So, yeah -- have we done anything? No. Are they talking about it, I'm sure. Have we announced anything? No. Might we? I bet you that we do." <P>  If that sounds a bit like Peter is leaving the door open for announcements at Spaceworld, you are not the only one. <P>  When asked specifically about Sonic's appearance in Super Smash Brothers Melee for the GameCube, he commented, "Wouldn't surprise me at all if Sonic were to show up in Super Smash Bros. Melee. It wouldn't surprise me at all if two of the greatest videogame development talents in the world sat down and said, 'Hey, we've got to do something together.'" But it's just a rumor at this point. There is nothing definitive. And I'm not holding anything back. But with that said, I've got to believe that conversations are being had." <P>  While far from being a confirmation, we can take Mr. Moore's hedging comments as an indication that the project, in whatever shape it will eventually come in, will happen possibly as soon as Spaceworld, now only three weeks away. We'll have more on this story one way or the other then.<P></I>  Looks like we're all waiting untill Spaceworld...<P>  Source: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/">SegaWeb</A>   <br>

<b>DiC to partner up with Lions Gate</b> - sonmanic 17:35 pm 07-30-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
These articles from Kidscreen and Lion Gate Studios' website.<P>  Kidscreen reports:<P>    <I>...DIC has signed an exclusive distribution deal with Lions Gate Home Entertainment (a division of Lions Gate Studios) to distribute its library of programming in North America. For DIC, the multiyear deal represents its first step back into the home entertainment realm since Heyward, newly named DIC president Brad Brooks and investment company Bain Capital bought the company back from Disney in November.   Though DIC had planned to start releasing its shows on video and DVD in the spring, the process of choosing a distribution partner took longer than expected, says Don Gold, executive VP of home entertainment. Ultimately, though, selecting Lions Gate became a no-brainer. "Lions Gate was the most enthusiastic about our shows, and put together a plan that would allow DIC to be the focal point for all of its children's programming," says Gold.   As per the agreement, Lions Gate will release DIC's catalog, which includes some 2,500 half hours of programming, on VHS and DVD through its Trimark Home Entertainment division. Starting in August, Trimark will bow with best-of episodic collections for Sabrina: The Animated Series and the Ivan Reitman-produced Mummies Alive! on VHS and DVD, and will follow up with releases for Madeline in September. Gold says the two companies will work closely to aggressively market DIC's titles, and the partners plan to tie in promotionally with The Learning Company for video releases of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and with Sega for Sonic the Hedgehog, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.   Though DIC's agreement with Lions Gate covers North America only, Gold says the company has begun negotiating separate deals with a number of distributors outside the U.S. to distribute DIC's shows on DVD/VHS internationally.</I><P>  This from Lion Gate Studios' Website news page:  <P>  <I>June 6, 2001  DIC ENTERTAINMENT PARTNERS WITH LIONS GATE IN NORTH AMERICAN HOME ENTERTAINMENT DISTRIBUTION DEAL   (Burbank, CA. - June 6, 2001) - DIC Entertainment has inked an exclusive North American distribution deal for its extensive library of award-winning animation with Lions Gate Home Entertainment, it was announced today by Don Gold, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Home Entertainment at DIC, and Peter Block, President of Home Entertainment, Acquisitions and New Media at Lions Gate. Under the deal, Lions Gate will distribute the diverse library of properties within the DIC catalog, which is the second largest library of American animation in the world.  The deal marks an important step in the growth of both companies. For DIC, it is the first distribution deal for the Worldwide Home Entertainment division since DIC CEO Andy Heyward, along with Bain Capital, purchased DIC back from Disney in November, 2000. For Lions Gate, the partnership represents a giant step into the business of distributing children’s programming. By virtue of the deal, DIC will become the primary supplier of animation titles to Lions Gate. While Lions Gate will oversee the distribution of DIC’s extensive catalog of programs, the artwork, packaging and marketing of all releases will be a cooperative effort between both companies.  The first releases on VHS and DVD slated for August are “Sabrina, The Animated Series,” based on the hugely popular WB series starring Melissa Joan Hart, and “Mummies Alive!,” the Ivan Reitman-produced animated series. The planned DIC releases over the next several months include “Madeline,” “Sonic The Hedgehog,” “Carmen Sandiego,” “Inspector Gadget,” “Action Man,” as well as numerous other titles.  “Home Entertainment represents a significant source of revenue for any entertainment company, and I could not be more pleased that Lions Gate aggressively and enthusiastically pursued this distribution agreement. They have an exceptional sales staff, an innovative marketing team and a management staff marked by integrity and trust,” said Don Gold.  Peter Block said, “DIC has an extensive catalog of animated titles that have tremendous recognition and brand awareness across all generations, and we are honored that DIC has chosen Lions Gate as its distributor. DIC has a fantastic management team in place and has been a Company that continues to re-invent itself, and these factors were extremely important in our decision to distribute DIC titles. This is a key acquisition in building our sell-through catalog to the heights we believe it can soar to, and we look forward to our continuing relationship with DIC.”  Lions Gate Executive Vice President, North American Home Video Sales and Operations, Ron Schwartz added, “This acquisition will provide the powerful boost in our sell-through business that we’ve been looking for. As a home video company, we’ve had much success in the sell-through arena, but we’ve never had the opportunity to distribute such a wide array of quality children’s product. We are extremely pleased that DIC has placed their confidence in our hands.”  The deal was brought to Lions Gate by Guy Stodel, Lions Gate’s Vice President of Acquisitions. The deal was brokered on Lions Gate’s behalf by Peter Block and Ron Schwartz. Negotiating the deal on behalf of DIC were Don Gold and Matthew Erramouspe of O’Melveny & Myers LLP.  Lions Gate develops, produces and distributes a broad range of motion picture, television and other filmed entertainment content through its four operating divisions – Motion Pictures, Television, Animation and Studio Facilities. The distinctive Lions Gate brand is recognized as a symbol of original, cutting-edge, quality entertainment around the world.   DIC Entertainment was purchased in November 2000 by Andy Heyward in partnership with Bain Capital, LLC. DIC Entertainment is a leading children’s entertainment company focused on developing, producing, distributing, and merchandising children’s animated programming worldwide. Since its founding in 1983, DIC has produced over 100 series and 3,000 episodes, averaging over 145 new half-hour episodes per year for the last ten years. With approximately 2,500 episodes, DIC’s catalog is one of the largest and most valuable libraries of children’s animation television programming in the entertainment industry, boasting beloved evergreen brands such as Inspector Gadget, Madeline, Sailor Moon, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?, Action Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Super Mario Bros. DIC’s programs are watched by approximately 25 million kids in the US each week. </I><br>

<div class=itemtext>
Well, good news for you Sega Stock savvy folks...<P>  <I>Bloomberg news has posted a brief interview with Stephen Auth, global portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc. in which he discusses the state of the Japanese economy and the opportunities it presents to investors. Noting that the Japanese stock market is at an all-time low, he warns that it may be difficult to single out individual companies to invest in; he does strongly recommend mutual funds as an alternative. <P>  When pressed for exceptions, he specified Sega as one of only three companies he could name as being in a strong position. "In addition to software games, they are also going into a major restructuring, exiting the hardware business, going from a loss-making situation to a profit one," he said. Sega's stock is valued at a respectable $4.05 despite four years of large losses. <P>  If the company turns a profit this year as they plan, it could move upward rapidly. Auth also mentions Nintendo as a strong buy, no doubt buoyed by the successful launch of their Game Boy Advance system and strong buzz on the upcoming GameCube. Notably going unmentioned was Sony, whose stock has dropped 50% in the past year, including a $5 drop today on poor earnings news. <P></I>  Source: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/">SegaWeb</A><br>

<b>Apparently No Dreamcast Price Cut for Europe...</b> - Bumper 13:04 pm 07-27-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Big info from FGN Online regarding the DC price cuts in Europe:<P>  <I>Sega's next-gen console looks set for a further two price drops before the launch of Xbox and Gamecube later this year – but only in the U.S. it seems. The system currently retails for $99.99, but in an attempt to clear out inventory, two price cuts are now expected before the holidays. <P>  We received word from an anonymous source that Sega will cut the price on August 12 to $79.99, the new All Stars Sports Pack will sell for $99.99 featuring NFL 2K1 and NBA 2K1. The price is then expected to plummet one last to $49.99 around the turn of the year – that's almost the price of a game! <P>  Sega U.S. has yet to officially announce the deal, and is refusing to be drawn on the subject in the U.S. Thankfully though, bigwigs at major retails firms can’t keep quiet about it. Speaking to the Hollywood reporter, Doreen McKenzie, director of merchandising and videogames at Babbage's, revealed, "After the initial price drop to $79.99, Sega has told us that it will further reduce the price to $49.99 either around Christmas or early next year, depending on how much inventory it has left over." <P>  It's a different story in Europe however. Dick Francis, Managing Director for the firm that now handles all things Dreamcast, told FGN Online, "Planet Distribution has no intention of lowering the price of Dreamcast from £99.99. We have been very happy with our hardware sales figures and on software, especially from the game Sonic Adventure 2." <P>  He continued, "We have strong support from retailers and excellent sales into the consumer. Planet Distribution has exciting marketing plans in place for Christmas. Dreamcast has shown exceptional performance to date and we categorically have no intention of lowering the price from £99.99." <P></I>  Well, if things hold as the firm says, European Sega fans may not be too happy come X-mas...<P> Source: <A HREF="http://www.fgnonline.com/">FGN Online</A>  <br>

<b>Sega partners up with Earthnet</b> - Bumper 13:35 pm 07-24-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Very important news for users of the Dreamcast's on-line capabilities.  Hopefully, good news...<P>  <I>Sega.com announced today that they have partnered with EarthLink, and will now provide all of the content previously available exclusively through SegaNet to gamers outside the network. EarthLink effectively becomes SegaNet's "preferred ISP", similar to how AT&T was before SegaNet launched. <P>  Current SegaNet accounts will be converted to EarthLink accounts seamlessly, with a new monthly price of $19.99. How this affects customers who purchased a Dreamcast with the SegaNet rebate was not addressed. "EarthLink can provide the speed, reliability and customer service that gamers want to be competitive online," said Marc Connor, who holds the interesting title of Director of Strategic Partnerships & Alliances, Sega.com. <P>  This is a distinct change from Sega's original plans for their gaming ISP. Early last year Sega of America president Peter Moore told gamers.com, "What SegaNet will provide is a direct hub network for SegaNet subscribers... rather than being routed all around the Internet as I might be on, let's say, EarthLink or MSN." <P>  The alliance sounds as if SegaNet is being brought into the EarthLink fold, most likely driven by lower numbers of paying subscribers than Sega had anticipated; the merging of ISPs has become common as of late, such as NetZero's recent purchase of Juno. The new partnership will bring much higher exposure to SegaNet while providing over a quarter million new monthly customers to EarthLink. <P>  Also stated in the release is the first official comment that SegaNet will expand to other systems sooner rather than later. The statement specifies that "as new consoles come online later this year, Sega.com plans to open its high-speed network to a wider audience of online gamers." Since the PlayStation 2 is the only console set to go online this year (pending a shock announcement from Nintendo), we can take as a given that Sega and Sony's recently announced network partnership will extend beyond Japan. <P></I>  There you have it, everyone.<P>  Source: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/">SegaWeb</A>  <br>

I was surfing around on ebay and I saw an interesting item:<br> <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1251798434&r=0&t=0&showTutorial=0&ed=994430215&indexURL=0&rd=1">SNES Sonic The Hedgehog 4 RARE Import!!!</a><br><br> At first I thought it might possible be Sonic Crackers because of the 'Sonic 4' title it was given, then I saw it said SNES.  (Super Nintendo Entertainment System)  I knew something was up, and sure enough when I checked the link, I was right.  The item was a fake. <br><br> The item the loser is selling is actually a hacked Speedy Gonzalas (SP??) ROM made by someone when hacking was a big deal in the Sonic community.  The ROM must have been put on some SNES cart, and the picture of the cart was pasted together with scenes of Sonic 3 and other games.  All though so far, I've been unsuccessful in locating the ROM or the owner, but if anyone has it or knows who made the ROM, let us or ebay know so we can stop this scam.  If it's one thing I hate, it's people taking advantage of Sonic fans.  So if you see this item on ebay: <IMG SRC="http://www.emuroms.com/pics/sonic4.jpg"><br><br> DON'T BID ON IT!  It's not real!  <br>

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
