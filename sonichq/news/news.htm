<div class=itemtext>
From coremagazine.com...  <p><i>Sega is gearing up for the release of the latest chapter in their Sonic series on the Game Boy Advance. Scheduled for release on December 20th in Japan, Sonic Advance will feature four playable characters; Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. At first glance the game appears reminiscent of its 16-bit predecessors, however, Sega has a few added goodies planned for Sonic Advance. Specifically, new gameplay elements including rail sliding and several linkup mini-games are expected in the finished version.</p></i>  <p><u><b>The Images</b></u> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna1.jpg" target="_whole">Image 1</a> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna2.jpg" target="_whole">Image 2</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna3.jpg" target="_whole">Image 3</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna4.jpg" target="_whole">Image 4</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna5.jpg" target="_whole">Image 5</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna6.jpg" target="_whole">Image 6</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna7.jpg" target="_whole">Image 7</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna8.jpg" target="_whole">Image 8</a>   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/screenshot.php3?image=sna9.jpg" target="_whole">Image 9</a>  <p><b>Source</b> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.coremagazine.com" target"_whole">www.coremagazine.com</a><br>

<div class=itemtext>
Amazingly, there's still new stuff coming out about Sonic 2 Beta. (See the "Hedgehog That Never Was" page in game info if you're unfamiliar with it.)  <p><a href=https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://pub54.ezboard.com/fstharea51messageboardfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2518.topic>This post</a> on the Sonic Area 51 message board contains screenshots of 2 badniks seen in the off-center magazine screenshots but not in the beta game itself.  <p>This practically proves that the off-center pics, including the one generally known as "Dust Hill," were from an even earlier version of the Sonic 2 beta.  Also found was a never-seen-before fish badnik.<br>

<div class=itemtext>
This was taken from consolewire.com...  <i><p>With a new price drop and an unexpected surge in demand in Japan, Dreamcast production has resumed, although for a very limited run.  CRI, a Sega subsidiary, will produce 2000 black Dreamcast units, which can be preordered starting next week. The final units will ship to customers in February or March 2002. Sega abandoned costly Dreamcast production due to the financial drain the modest-selling console was inflicting on the company. Sega has since returned to its core expertise of game development.   <p>No plans have been announced for the North American market where Dreamcast consoles are available for $50.</i>   <p><b>Source</b> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.consolewire.com" target="_whole">consolewire.com</a>  <br>

<div class=itemtext>
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG #107 <p> Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders, art by Ron Lim, Pam Eklund, Andrew Pepoy, Dawn Best and Penders, cover by Spaz.  <p> "Crouching Hedgehog, Hidden Dragon Part Two." Things are heating up as Sonic continues defending the Hidden City of the Ancients from the dragon that besieged it in the last issue. Meanwhile, the rest of the Freedom Fighters do their best to keep damage to a minimum - both to the building and the citizenry, whose alliance the Freedom Fighters are counting on. It's not easy - someone or something is intent on keeping them from accomplishing their mission. Who could it be? "Reunification Part Two." It's the moment Knuckles fans have been waiting for: the embattled hero has finally restored his family and friends back to their home of the Floating Island - but with the Dark Legion now part of the equation, can confrontation be far behind?  <p> 32 pages, $1.99, ships on Feb. 8.<p><i>Source: <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011210000000/http://www.comicscontinuum.com target=_blank>Comics Continuum</a></i><br>
