Supposedly, if you get all 180 emblems in SA2, a secret area opens up, loaded with cool extras.  Also, according to this rumor, there IS a point to all the hidden Bigs in the game.  This area sounds too good to be true, but after the other stuff that's been revealed about SA2, it wouldn't really surprise me too much if it was in there.  If it is, then kudos to Sonic Team for putting something like this intro the game for the 10th anniversary.  This is a mild spoiler, since you may want to be surprised by what you get when you get 180 emblems, so it's listed in a link.<p><a href=display.cgi?mm=06&yyyy=2001&id=25&series=sonic target=_blank>Click here to read more.</a><br>

<b>Sony to Distribute Sega's PS2 Titles in Europe</b> - Bumper 13:24 pm 06-21-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
From SegaWeb...<P>  <I>Sony will be publishing Sega's first seven PlayStation 2 titles in Europe, the two companies announced jointly today. Sega will turn over the publishing, advertising, and distribution reigns over to Sony in the territory, who will distribute the titles in five languages. The titles include the previously announced Virtua Fighter 4, K-Project, and Space Channel 5 games; the four new games are Ecco the Dolphin, F-355, Head Hunter, and a second Space Channel 5 title. <P>  At least two of the seven titles will be released this year, though which ones were not specified. It is unknown if the confirmation of Head Hunter coming to the PS2 will impact the Dreamcast version of the title. <P>  The partnership was made for a number of reasons, not the least of which being logistics. "Since we do not have our own marketing network in Europe, we decided to have SCE to handle distribution of our games for PlayStation 2," a Sega spokesman said. While Sega will continue to distribute their own Dreamcast titles in Europe, the additional titles will not put a strain on the company, which is currently undergoing a major reorganization. Whether the partnership will be renewed after these seven games are released was not addressed. <P>  This is the third major partnership between Sega and Sony this year. In February they announced plans to co-develop a network of arcades using Sony's PS2-based arcade technology, and earlier this month announced plans to create cross-platform online titles for consoles and PC. The latest announcement was made after the stock market had closed in Tokyo, though Sega's share price rose nearly 2 percent prior the announcement, following weeks of declines. <P>  For those keeping track, Sega has also announced a Sakura Wars title, two 'Let's Make a Sports Team' games, an online horse derby title, Guru Guru Onsen 2, and two Sega Sports games (NBA and NFL) for the PS2, bringing the total number of announced Sega games coming to PS2 up to 14. </I><P>  Source: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/">SegaWeb</A>  <br>

After Isao Ohkaw, the company's former President and Chairman, passed away in March, he donated his stakes to the company. With Sega holding 4.4 million shares (or 5.9% in stake) in CSK along with 19.88 million shares of it's own company (or 12.2% in stakes), it will be very interesting to see what the financial state will be for them in the near future.</I><P>  Probably not particularly interesting for most folks out there, but this is worth noting, nonetheless.<P>  Source: <A HREF="http://www.cloudchaser.com/cc/sega/">SegaDojo</A>   <br>

<img src="http://dcmedia.ign.com/media/misc/sonic_adventure2.jpg" align="left">Although IGN had this interview on their IGN Insider, they have released the interview to the public! check it out.</p>  <p><b>IGNDC: Will there be online features for Sonic Adventure 2? </b></p>  <p>TI: Right now we're still in the planning stages of our online features, and while it hasn't been completed yet, basically the player will play the game and once they complete a stage or level, they'll receive a certain ranking. And through the Internet, they'll be able to upload their score and see how he ranks against other players on a worldwide basis. </p> <p<b>  <p>IGNDC: Having played through the game numerous times, we've been able to see the big changes in Sonic Adventure 2 in terms of the faster gameplay and improved frame rate. What other major improvements have been made in Sonic Adventure 2 over Sonic Adventure? </p>  <p>TI: (laughs) There are so many, it's pretty hard to answer that. Obviously we wanted to make Sonic Adventure 2 run at 60 frames per second and design the stages so that when you play the game, you feel like you're going a lot faster. And then, the two-player versus modes was the next big benchmark after we established the 60 frames per second.<br> And for the future of Sonic's actions, instead of blazingly running through a stage, we've given him more actions so he's not just constantly running. So he'll run, he'll grind on a rail, then he'll spin dash into an obstacle, etc. It's not just about running fast; we wanted to create a "tempo" for the action. </p>  <p><b>IGNDC: Speaking of the two-player mode, right now in our preview version, there are three versus games &#8211; Sonic Vs, Shadow, Tails Vs. Dr. Eggman, and Knuckles Vs. Rouge. Are there any more mini-games planned and will other characters be able to battle each other (i.e. Sonic Vs Tails)?</b> </p>  <p>TI: Ahh... well, that's your preview version (smiles). For that preview version, we've only included one stage per versus game. With the full version, you'll see a lot more stages for each versus mode. I really can't say too much about the versus games yet, but there are two other versus modes we're thinking about incorporating outside of the three that you've played.</p>  <p><a href="http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/35406.html">IGNDC's full interview</a></p><br>

Better yet, how about raising you Chao to be a little "rascal" being with the likes of Shadow, Dr. Eggman or Rouge. This is all possible with the new breed of Chao in Sonic Adventure 2. Chao are now directly affected by which game characters interact with them, and over time, their personality and appearance will change. Also, your Chao's personality is affected by how you interact with them...bully your Chao and he might just turn out to become a little rascal... </p>  <p><b>Chao Garden</b></p>  <p>Welcome to Chao garden that will be your first stop when you acquire the "Chao key" in the action stage.
