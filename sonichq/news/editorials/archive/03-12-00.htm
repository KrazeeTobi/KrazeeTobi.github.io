<p>My opinion on the comics? Well, It's not that I hate it...It just needs to
be improved big time. A love triangle with Sonic, Sally and Amy I would
rather enjoy. I dont care much for Nate Morgan or Rotor, they can both get
robotisized for all I care, along with Sally and her annoying family too
(after her and Amy fight over Sonic of course, hehe). 

<p>As far as Knuckles
goes.....I dont like the way he's portrayed in the comic, it makes me
appreciate him less. His personality's all wrong, and they didn't even give
him a cool jamacian accent like he's suppose to have, I mean they give
Antoine his french accent, and give a few other characters an australian
accent, why not Knuckles with a jamacian accent, thats the way he originally
was back in the Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles games.

And Y'know, the plot is no way nearly as good as it has potential to be.
Personally, to accomidate Sonic's new look....uhh......well, they really
shouldve just skipped ahead a few yrs, so he would be older and he wouldve
just grown into his new look, instead of that stupid freak accident in that
one issue......and the same goes for Amy, with her getting older, they
couldve done that in a better way too. They also shouldn't try to include the
plot of the video games and such with there plot, it makes it dull. They
should try to fit in the characters from the games that surve a purpose in
the plot, but not the video game plot itself. I mean that "Endgame" saga
was original, not based off anything, and I still enjoy it even today. I
would also like to see more humor, Mike Gallagher humor to be exact. Oh well, thats
all i really have to say about the plot. The artwork is also in need of
improvement. It isnt as good as it used to be, thier older style was
better. Well that concludes this editorial/opinion essay. Thank you.
