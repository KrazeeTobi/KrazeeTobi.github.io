<p>Hmm.... I just looked at Ian the Potto's editorial response, and maybe it's time for me to say a few things brought up on that.

<p>Lupe, Valdez, and several others have been lost to Robotnik over the past while, yes, but I do see two ways to look at 
this whole thing.  Ian's way, as a pathway for Rotor's demise.  Or looking at it in the way that these guys are small 
potatoes compared to the act of roboticizing Rotor, an original character in the series with a lot of likeness and respect 
throughout the Archie comic fandom.

<p>Personally, I don't think this is Nate VS. Rotor.  No way.  The two have already collaborated together excellantly.  
They've already shown they can work together with great ease.  Nate can be made a great character, but he's gotta stop being 
Rotor's stand-in and be his own self.  Plus, Nate's been made a plot-filler, and a not-too-great one at that.  Examples:  He 
happens to have a Super Emerald right when they need it, he made the Power Rings(Supposedly).  He happens to know the police 
chief in the City of Ancients.  Nate can be a good character, but he's gotta stop being this stupid plotfiller and start to 
make a character of his own.

<p>Abilities.  I don't think comparing Nate and Rotor's abilities is such a great idea.  Nate's a senior citizen.  I think he 
tought Uncle Chuck.  Of course he's gonna know more than a teenager.  Rotor's a prodigy, who hasn't even come close to 
realizing his full potential, honestly.  And that will take time.  And that's where Nate comes in, for me.  These two can 
teach other so much, they come from such different backgrounds that they can teach each other immensely.  

<p>But more than anything, this is about what the fans want.  We're the ones reading this comic.  And the vast majority of 
we fans don't want to see Rotor roboticized.  You need proof, take a look at the polls on the SHQ News Page and see the 
results thus far.  If Archie is not both deaf and blind, they should see that roboticizing Rotor would be a big mistake. 
Ian has said the spectulation about it would prepare us for it should it happen, and 

<p><img src=../images/rotor2.jpg align=right>
I perfectly agree there.  It would help 
us overcome the initial shock.  But the fact is, if he was roboticized, there would some very PO'ed fans out there.  But it 
also won't do for him to stay in limbo forever.  They need to bring Rotor back in my opinion, and I think a lot of fans 
agree with me.  

Thank you.
