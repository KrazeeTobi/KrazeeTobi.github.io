WAAH! A very, VERY SHORT editorial.

I enjoyed the Love Arc in Knuckles, but why oh why couldn't someone
else 
could have been artist!?!?  The first time to see deep emotion among 
Knuckles and The Chaotix, and we get this.  To put it in one word: WHY?
 
Manny where are you??!  Just shoot me now!

We watched him fight and cry, but we get this treatment for love?  ERR!
 
GROWL!  I'm sure Chris is a great artist, but WHY?  I shouldn't say 
anything...I don't have a say, it's so very insignificant...right?  
Especially when it come to being a fan.  I better be careful.  Someone
might 
kill for criticizing mediocre art.

This editorial is short.  Why?  There is nothing more to say!  SIGH.
