<p>Dear Sonique,
            
<p>I couldn’t help but be slightly enlightened by your
editorial titled “Why Sonic is Failing”.  You do indeed make some
very good points.  However, I have to point out some other points
that may offer hope, and others that reinforce your position.  This
is not intended as a flame.  I just wish to inform; forgive me if I
say anything you already know.  I must say your article did indeed
change my opinion of things slightly, and shed some new light on
things.

<p>I honestly don’t see SEGA giving up on Sonic.  He’s
their
main mascot and franchise, making an incredible amount of money.
SEGA knows this, and will continue to exploit Sonic as long as the
franchise is profitable.  Since Sonic Adventure was sold at a nearly
1:1 ratio with the Dreamcast console, I think he’ll be around for a
while.  He may not always be the same hedgehog, however.  This is
because developers frequently come and go at all companies.  Now,
each new game he’ll be a little different, as the newer games are
capable and do, in fact, portray him in much more complicated
manner.  I.e. voice, animation, etc.

<p>SEGA isn’t going anywhere, either.  They’ve had a
fantastic response with Dreamcast, partly because of the console’s
relative cheapness.  The console is still selling well, according to
a friend who works at Babbage’s, and is probably going to continue to
do so.  Also, don’t expect Dreamcast to be the last SEGA console.  We
don’t know what they’re working on, but rest assured they’ve
got
something up their sleeve that’ll blow away even the Nintendo
Dolphin.  That’s the way the cycle goes.  Since SEGA is going to stay
here for a while, the above logic in the 2nd paragraph would note
that Sonic will be here for just as long.

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a household name now, and SEGA
knows it.  Notice how we got a third Sonic cartoon, after such a long
absence of them?  Yes, it was crap, I agree.  But it was still
there.  Since Sonic will be around, I would wager a guess that future
Sonic cartoons will probably come back as well.  (I just hope DiC
finally listens to us and gets us back SatAM.)  It may not come back,
but there is a fairly good chance, since so many fans got hooked on
SatAM and the comics.

<p>Trust me, Sonic is as popular as ever.  He isn’t as
“new”
as before, so he’s talked about less, but he’s everywhere and
everyone knows the little blue speed freak’s name and fame.  I can
ask any random person at my high school, and they'll know him.  I
could ask almost anyone on the street, and they'll know who he is.

            The SEGA consoles themselves weren’t bad, but they did
have external problems.  At one point, SEGA had several console
platforms out at once.  People and developers didn’t know what to do,
so they went elsewhere.  SEGA CD, Genesis, 32X and Saturn were all
available to the end user, and developers were confused as to which
to move to.  So the moved to another console.  With only a few games
out for each platform, each platform failed.  SEGA has shown us that
it’s learned from it’s mistake by the fantastic launch of the
Dreamcast console.

<p>You do bring up some good points yourself, however.  The Archie
series reached its peak a little before End Game.  After that, they
strayed almost entirely from their concept of Tails being a “chosen
one” and everything they stood for.  It was only mediocre to begin
with, but at least it was something.  I don’t pick up the comic very
much, if at all, anymore.  It’s just gotten to the point where SEGA
is keeping too tight a hold on things and the plot holes are so
incredibly huge that an aircraft carrier could fit through them with
a 5-year-old at the helm.

<p>SEGA itself is causing problems, as you said.  Without
giving the authors any creative freedom, the Archie series and Sonic
Underground have suffered, and one has died.  When an author’s
creative freedom is limited, the story is impacted very negatively.
Since SEGA has decided to keep a stranglehold on Ken Penders, the
Archie series is suffering.

<p>  Part of the reason that SatAM became so popular was that
somehow Ben Hurst was able to get a lot past the SEGA reps. Think
about it; he’s done a lot in the Sonic universe no one save fan
fiction authors (who aren’t limited by SEGA) have been able to do.
Including having Sonic display some emotion.  When you let an author
turn him or herself loose on something, especially with one as
talented as Ben or Ken, you’ll get some seriously cool stories.
Limit his abilities, and the story’s impact on the audience will be
limited as much or more.

<p>So what can we do to pass the time?  Well, for starters,
we can bring Sonic more life than he ever had in the games, cartoons,
or comics.  To do this, we must write.  We must dream. We must
create.  I know there are many very capable fan fiction authors out
there who can truly bring out the best in Sonic, Robert Brown and
Francis Tolbert being one team.  We, as fans, have the tools, the
talent, and the opportunity to write about Sonic in such fan fiction
that would make Mercedes Lackey turn her head.  Hidden the ruff of
the ordinary fan fiction are a few diamonds that are amazingly
bright.  SEGA is a business involved in many things; it’s up to us to
fill the gaps when SEGA is forced to turn it’s attention elsewhere.

<p> Yes, Sonic is going downhill in many ways.  The Archie
comics are falling behind in creative power, the many cartoons are no
longer showing, and SEGA isn’t helping by keeping Ken under their
crosshairs while he tries to do his work.  The fans, however, are not
limited by such business politics.  We can create, too.  We have
been.  We will continue to do so.  In this manner, even if SEGA
itself were to fall, Sonic would live on.  Sonic will once again be
in the spotlight; he will return.  Until he does, let’s keep the
throne of gaming warm for him.
