OK. Ever have it happen where you thought you would finally get the 
answer to a nailbiting question, only to have it lead to more 
questions?<P>

Well, that's just happened to me.<P>

This editorial is a follow-up to my last one: 
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/sonicwhammy/edit10.html">Royalty 
Blues</A>. Since that commentary, two major events have gone down to 
answer the puzzle of who will ascend the throne of Mobius with Sally. 
Those events, however, have left things rather unclear.<P>

First, we saw in Sonic #77 that King Acorn has suddenly turned face 
toward Sonic. Where the two were once at odds, our King now takes back 
everything that he held against Sonic, and is preparing to knight him 
in the newly-sanctioned Kingdom of Knothole in Sonic #78.<P>

To add to this, we witness what I had been waiting for over the past 
5 months: The Girls Rule Special, wherein Sally undergoes the rite to 
bond with the Source of All in order to be the next to ascend the 
throne. Finally, the question would be answered: Who will the Source 
of All choose for Sally as her King?<P>

Unfortunately, here's where we're left in the cold. Sally doesn't 
complete the ritual. Instead, she opts to find her own path to the 
throne.<P>

This has now left me very confused, since Ken Penders decided not to 
answer my question clearly. And it's not the first time I've seen or 
felt this type of confusion. Anybody remember this example from the 
movie CLUE:<P>

Colonel Mustard: All right, look, pay attention, everybody. Wadsworth, 
am I right in thinking there is nobody else in this house?<BR>
Wadsworth: No.<BR>
CM: Then there IS someone else in this house.<BR>
W: No, sorry, I said no meaning yes.<BR>
CM: No meaning yes... Look I want a straight answer. Is there someone 
else or isn't there? Yes or no?<BR>
W: No.<BR>
CM: "No, there IS", or "No, there ISN'T"?<BR>
W: Yes.<BR>
Mrs. White: (breaking her glass over the mantle) PLEASE!!!<P>

(After everyone argues about the motorist still in the lounge)<P>

CM: Well, there is still some confusion as to whether or not there is 
anybody else in this house.<BR>
W: I told you, there isn't!<BR>
CM: There isn't any confusion or there isn't anybody else?<BR>
W: Either... or both.<BR>
CM: Just give me a clear answer!<BR>
W: Certainly... (clears his throat) what was the question?<BR>
CM: IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE?!<BR>
All: NO!!!<P>

See what I mean? Ken didn't answer the question straight the first 
time, and now I'm so confused that he forgot the question by the time 
I got my bearings straight. NOW, I have new questions based on the 
events in "Ascensions" and events to come. They are based on these 3 
issues.<P>

Issue #1: The ritual. It took place before Sonic #74, which is the 
only time that it could have happened, given that Eggman/Robotnik has 
overtaken the kingdom again, and it's just after Elias told his sister 
about his intentions. During the ritual, we discover that Sally's 
chosen one would be SONIC! (A reason I'm personally steamed the ritual 
was not completed.) Also of note: The spirits of King Acorn, Elias & 
the future Sally meet with Sally in the pool, in order for her to 
understand the Source, and take the next step in completing the rite. 
So now that she backed out, the answer I wanted escaped me.<P>

Issue #2: King Acorn's "All For Sonic" turn. Sudden? No kidding. 
Deserved? You betcha. The reasons for this change of heart? Consider 
this logic. King Max is one with the Source. Thus, he knows when 
anyone is trying to bond with it. Even though Sally took the rite 
behind his back, he would know that she was doing it. This explains 
why he appeared to Sally in the pool. At the same time, it means that 
he could also see the future that Sally saw: The one with SONIC - not 
Antoine - as her King. That fact alone means that King Max knows that 
Sonic's making it to the throne. Heck, maybe it's even because of that 
knowledge that Max is KNIGHTING the guy in Sonic #78. And even though 
Sally did not complete the rite, King Max still knows Sally's thoughts 
and the future she wishes for because of the length of the ritual that 
she DID go through. Therefore, because the Source says so, he now 
accepts Sonic with open arms. But because the rite wasn't finished, 
does that mean that Antoine is still first in Max's mind? Or is he 
still thinking to put Elias in the hot seat?<P>

<CENTER>WARNING: SPOILERS COMING!</CENTER><P>

Issue #3: Amy Rose. Thanks to the magic of preview material again, 
Amy Rose will use Sonic #79 as her chance to adapt into her Sonic 
Adventure self. However, to do this, she takes the super emerald that 
is keeping Queen Alicia's life support going and draws all its power.
This turns her into her older-looking self from the game. Two things 
happen as a result. First, Amy Rose is now a new contender in the love 
wars, because she can finally try for Sonic's affections since she's 
on the same age level with him now. Second, her drawing from the 
emerald puts Queen Alicia on the critical list, and that's probably 
not gonna make the Acorn family happy, especially Sally. Hey, now this 
could lead to one of the biggest catfights this side of ECW's Beulah & 
Francine. (But since furries wear little clothes if any, this one 
could be much more painful.)<P>

So where we thought we would get our final answer to all this royalty 
and relationship stuff, we just get another pro-wrestling finish where 
the answer won't come until later. Now I know that part of the reason 
for this is because of SEGA's influence on Ken Penders, Karl Bollers, 
and all the rest of the Archie bunch (or at least I wouldn't be 
surprised). But this has all just reached a point where maybes just 
don't satisfy me any more. Please Ken, I beg of you now. I don't care 
if you guys never get to bring the angle any further, but once and for 
all, JUST GIVE ME A CLEAR ANSWER!!<P>

And DON'T forget what the question was.<P>

Thank you for your time. I am<P>
