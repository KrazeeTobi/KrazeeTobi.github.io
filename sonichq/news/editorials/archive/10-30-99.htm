<p>As you browse the net today you'll undoubtedly see all the news about
the SEGA Dreamcast. It's been a smash in America, Europe, Japan and
other countries around the
world. But down in down under, we're still waiting for the Dreamcast as
delays keep on
being announced. 

<p>Ever since the megadrive/genesis went out of fashion,
SEGA has never really cut it in Australia. When the 32-X came out in
here, it was around for 1 day, then it dissappeared into nothingness. I
was only able to find it months later in a bargain bin outside a closing
down, electronics store. Even then it was practically a free gift with
megadrive games and there was/are no games for it. The Saturn was the
next fiasco. I only ever saw one ad for it and the ad was only on once.
Then the Saturn was released with a poor selection of games and despite
the more superior hardware, the Saturn was considered, "not as good" as
Playstation, Nintendo 64(which some people still think is a 64 bit
system. It's not, it's a 32 bit system). So the Saturn died a death, but
more was to come. The ads for the SEGA Dreamcast, the ultimate gaming
system started months before it's release. They were even distributed on
the net!

<p>The ads never came to Australia, even several days before it's official
release.

<p>The Dreamcast was due for release 9/9/99 but that was postponed till 28
of Sept because of the Aussie rules football, grand final. (Pretty lame
excuse because the grand final is nowhere near that time) Then they told
us it was postponed again due to internet programming problems, this
time till October sometime. I rang up Hi-Tech World to get the next
release date, they said "October the 11th and we've ordered a heap but
don't hold your breathe, I doubt it'll be released on time". He was
right, now, we've been told, we have to wait till November the 30th or
so for "no good reason". The only way to get one is to win one and so
far there have only been a few to win. But the ads never-the-less,
didn't show and unless you have access to the net, or read the limited
info in gaming magazines. You wouldn't have the faintest clue what a
Dreamcast or Sonic Adventure is.

<p>So as the world watches the little countdowns on the Sonic sites and
talk of how cool their Dreamcasts are, we Australians sit and wait for these elusive
Dreamcasts. If they ever come here that is, and if they do, will anyone know about
it?</p>
