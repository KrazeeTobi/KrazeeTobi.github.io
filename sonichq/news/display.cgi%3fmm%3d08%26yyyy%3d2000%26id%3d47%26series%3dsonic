<b>News Update</b> - Tristan 0:19 am 08-28-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
I suppose I should explain why I've been gone for two weeks...basically, I took some time off to enjoy what's left of my Summer, and that didn't go so well.  So, I used up what was left of the time to focus on my own site.  That said, you're probably wondering where the new RA News is.  I can tell you it's coming <b>September 10th</b>, when we're right in the middle of the Sonic Amateur Games Expo.  <p>But, for now, here's all the Sonic and Sega news that's happening now.<p><b>SAGE Promotion Sent:</b> And speaking of SAGE, Ryan Bloom, commonly known as Blaze Hedgehog, has sent out letter to major videogame websites, in the hopes that at least one of them will cover the event.  If that happens it could mean a lot of great things could come out of this event, so we'll have to wait over the next couple of days and see.  <p><b>FTC Study: Violent Games Aimed at Teens?:</b>  The Federal Trade Commission is finished its one year study of the entertainment industry and its marketing, and they have proclaimed that so-called violent video games and movies are deliberately marketed towards teens.  The study also claims that the ratings on movies and games are vague, and are sometimes overlooked.  This study was ordered by US president Bill Clinton after the tragedy that was the Columbine High School shooting.  John McCain will try and have a hearing on this study when it is officially released next month, but Joe Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate and a severe critic of the entertainment industry, has already volunteered to testify in the hearing.  However, because Hollywood moguls usually donate funds to the Democrats, it might be a costly mistake.  More info on this should be coming soon.  <p><b>Daytona Not Far?:</b> Rumors are flying that Daytona 2, the much liked driving title for the arcade will get a Dreamcast port, and it will be released as early as December.  Either that, or a completely original title called Daytona 500 might be on the horizon soon.  Or, perhaps a little something called Daytona Online, most likely geared towards the SegaNet network.  <p>And that's it for now.  I'll be back next weekend, Labor Day Weekend, with a wrap-up of the week's news.

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
