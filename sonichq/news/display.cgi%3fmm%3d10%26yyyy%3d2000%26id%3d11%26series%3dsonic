Good evening, and happy Columbus Day, Yom Kippur, and/or Thanksgiving (in Canada, that is.)  Today, I have a couple things to pass along to you, including Malaysia banning arcade games, Samba maracas at EBWorld, and Daytona getting a date...man, some have all the luck...<p><p><b>Malaysia Bans Arcade Games:</b> In an effort to bring up good children for the country, Malaysia issued an order last Wednesday to shut down all arcades within the next two months.  The press was notified of this just a day or two ago.  So, if you think the USA has a problem with Joe Lieberman, it could be worse...  <p><b>Samba Maracas Up For Pre-Order:</b> We're one week away from Samba, but EBWorld.com has finally put up the Samba DC game and maraca peripherals up for pre-ordering.  The maracas cost eighty US dollars, the game half that amount.  Remember, Samba is in stores October 17th, next Tuesday.  <p><b>Daytona Gets a Date:</b> And Sega of Japan has issued a Decmber 21st release date for Daytona DC in Japan.  That release will coincide with the Japanese release of Sonic Shuffle, of all things.  Look for Daytona DC, with full online play enabled, by next year domestically.  <p>And that's it...back to school, back to work tomorrow, but I'll be back for sure next weekend.

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>.
