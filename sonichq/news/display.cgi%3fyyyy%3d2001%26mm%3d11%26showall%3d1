This was taken from consolewire.com...  <i><p>With a new price drop and an unexpected surge in demand in Japan, Dreamcast production has resumed, although for a very limited run.  CRI, a Sega subsidiary, will produce 2000 black Dreamcast units, which can be preordered starting next week. The final units will ship to customers in February or March 2002. Sega abandoned costly Dreamcast production due to the financial drain the modest-selling console was inflicting on the company. Sega has since returned to its core expertise of game development.   <p>No plans have been announced for the North American market where Dreamcast consoles are available for $50.</i>   <p><b>Source</b> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://www.consolewire.com" target="_whole">consolewire.com</a>  <br>

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG #107 <p> Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders, art by Ron Lim, Pam Eklund, Andrew Pepoy, Dawn Best and Penders, cover by Spaz.  <p> "Crouching Hedgehog, Hidden Dragon Part Two." Things are heating up as Sonic continues defending the Hidden City of the Ancients from the dragon that besieged it in the last issue. Meanwhile, the rest of the Freedom Fighters do their best to keep damage to a minimum - both to the building and the citizenry, whose alliance the Freedom Fighters are counting on. It's not easy - someone or something is intent on keeping them from accomplishing their mission. Who could it be? "Reunification Part Two." It's the moment Knuckles fans have been waiting for: the embattled hero has finally restored his family and friends back to their home of the Floating Island - but with the Dark Legion now part of the equation, can confrontation be far behind?  <p> 32 pages, $1.99, ships on Feb. 8.<p><i>Source: <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://www.comicscontinuum.com target=_blank>Comics Continuum</a></i><br>

<b>Ooh... Sega Gets a Burn....</b> - Bumper 6:32 am 11-07-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Sega has gotten a burn in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly.  Read the following from Swirlvision to get the goods.<P>  <I>In the newest issue of the pop-culture mag, Entertainment Weekly, EW staffers highlighted the 100 top holiday gift ideas. Among the videogame systems and games making the cut were the Game Boy Advanced (45th place), Dance Dance Revolution (47th place), retro videogame packages (69th place), and the unholy trio, the PS2, X-Box, and Gamecube (34th place). The Sega Dreamcast unforunately made the "What Not to Give" list, which probably means EW staffers are too cool for graphics of near-PS2 caliber and a library of nearly twice as many games (at this point) for what soon will be 1/6th the price... whatever. <P>  Joining the DC on the WNTG list (You didn't hear? EW says abbreviating stuff is in! If you don't abbreviate, you suck!) are Furbies, Cathy coffee mugs (Because there's no more Cathy comics! Get it?!? Those EW staffers SO have their fingers on the pulse of society!), Nad's hair removing gel, and the Ab Roller. That would be a pretty damn bad group to be a part of, if the HHG list didn't include Castaway Wilson volleyballs, lamps from Friends, silverware from Dawson's Creek, and the #1 ranked item, the George Foreman grill. Thanks but no thanks, EW... I'd rather sit on my inflatable furniture and water my Chia Pet, which both also made the WNTG list.<P>  In other EW news, Britney Spears is cool, Buffy rules, and anything that hasn't been seen on TRL, or Will and Grace is lame.<P></I>  Give me a break... well, fans probably won't care too much, if at all, anyway.  Still, I felt this was worth noting.<P>  Spurce: <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://66.34.113.184/swirlvision/">SwirlVision</A> <br>

Peter Moore has made an official public apology to Sega fans over the cancellation of the Dreamcast Version of Shenmue 2 in the U.S.  Said cancellation has angered many Sega fans, which may have prompted the following statement from Mr. Moore:<P>  <I>"To our Sega fans, <P>  "First, I want to thank the legion of loyal Sega fans for their unwavering enthusiasm and support over the past years - your dedication has truly been invaluable. As you all undoubtedly know, this year Sega is transitioning from a hardware manufacturer into a platform-agnostic third party publisher. During this change, Sega has had to make some very difficult business decisions, including the cancellation of Shenmue II for Dreamcast in the U.S. market.<P>   "I realize that this announcement is a difficult one for many people to swallow, and I sincerely apologize. While I cannot detail all of the reasons that led up to this decision, I can tell you that it was made with the long-term interests of Sega fans in mind. No matter how difficult it seems, I want you to understand that any difficult choices that are made during this transition time are based on one bottom line: ensuring the longevity of beloved Sega franchises, including Shenmue. Sega is working hard to make the necessary decisions to drive our business forward while at the same time continuing to support our loyal fans.<P>   "Although the company may be changing -- we are still Sega. Although the ride has sometimes been rocky, our promise to our fans is this: We will continue to push the boundaries of gaming with new content and technology. We will continue to deliver new and innovative games. We will continue to put out the games that no one else can. We will continue to be Sega and bring you only the best that gaming has to offer. Bear with us - the ride is going to get a lot smoother..." <P></I>  Well... let's see how public reaction is....<P>  Source: <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://www.fgnonline.com/">FGN Online</A>  <br>

Apparently, they're the oldest official Sonic characters besides Sonic and Eggman themselves.<p>On top of that, there's a lady on that Sonic secrets site whose name translates as "Madonna," and the profiles site claims that Bean from Sonic The Fighters is actually the son of Bin from the old Dynamite Dux Master System game.  @.@  If anyone has any info about these 2 tidbits, or the band, be sure to send it in.<br>

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>.

HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
