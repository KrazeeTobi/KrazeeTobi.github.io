<b>Sega bombs SegaSonic.Net</b> - Tails SA 0:53 am 01-30-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Hello, this is my first time posting.. but I think this is worth it: Sega has closed in on one of the most popular and long-running Sonic sites, SegaSonic.Net. Seems Sega wants the domain name for themselves, they don't even seem to want a negociation(sp?) either, and copyright probs are also in their pocket. I ask, if Sega can't take the fact that Sega/Sonic fans make websites about their favorite characters... is the Sonic Net safe? I think it's all BS, but don't take my word for it, read on...<p>From SegaSonic.Net: <b>Sorry, but SSN is currently unavailable due to negotiations with Sega. Below is a copy of the letter I received: <p> <p>  <p> <p>  <p> <i>Re: Improper Use of Sega's Intellectual Property <p> Dear Mr. Freda: <p> This firm represents Sega.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as "Sega" in this letter) with respect to certain intellectual property matters, and we are writing to you on Sega's behalf. We are unaware whether your company has retained counsel for this matter and, therefore, write this letter directly to you. If your company is represented by counsel, please let me know his or her name and contact information for future communications.  <p> As your company undoubtedly is aware, Sega owns numerous federal registrations and pending applications for trademarks comprised of or including the term SEGA or SONIC, such as the registered marks SEGA®, SEGA® (and Design), SEGA SPORTS®, SEGA VISIONS®, SEGA VIRTUA PROCESSOR® (and Design), SEGA SKI SUPER®, SEGA WATERSKI®, SEGA CD® (and Design), SEGA SATURN®, SONIC BLAST®, SONIC SPINBALL®, and SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: TRIPLE TROUBLE® to name only a few, for a wide variety of goods and services, including but not limited to computer game hardware, software and peripherals, video game programs, machines and peripherals, clothing, entertainment services, computer services, toys, and arcade game machines. Sega also owns several Internet domain names that incorporate its SEGA® and SONIC® trademarks and names, including but not limited to "www.sega.com," "www.sega.net," "www.sega.org," "sonicdreamcast.com," and "sonicdreamcast.net."  <p> In addition to these registrations, Sega's use and promotion of its SEGA® and SONIC® marks and names have been quite extensive. Indeed, since at least as early as 1976, Sega has used its family of SEGA® and SONIC® marks and names in connection with its various entertainment products and services in countries throughout the world. Moreover, Sega's "Sonic the Hedgehog" character (known throughout the world simply as "SONIC") has been a prominent character in numerous of Sega's games and its promotions of its entertainment products and services. Based upon Sega's longstanding, continuous and extensive use of its SEGA® and SONIC® marks, names and domain names and its SONIC® character, Sega's marks and its SONIC® character have become known worldwide to refer exclusively to Sega and its entertainment products and services and are entitled to protection under, among other things, the Federal Trademark Act (section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)), the Federal Anti-Dilution Act (section 43(c) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125 (c)(1)) and the Trademark Cyberpiracy Prevention Act (section 43(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125 (d)(1)).  <p> Notwithstanding Sega's established rights in its SEGA® and SONIC® marks, names and domain names and its SONIC® character, Sega recently discovered your company's and your improper and infringing use of Sega's SEGA® and SONIC® marks and names and images (which appear to be illegally copied from Sega's games) of its SONIC® character in connection with the gaming web site located at "www.segasonic.net." Your company's and/or your unauthorized use of Sega's SEGA® and SONIC® marks and names and its SONIC® character on its web site, and its improper use of Sega's SEGA® and SONIC® marks and names as a domain name, each unquestionably constitutes, among other things, intentional trademark infringement and dilution, as well a violation of the Trademark Cyberpiracy Prevention Act. Moreover, your company's display of images of Sega's SONIC® character (apparently copied illegally from Sega's games) constitutes copyright infringement. <p> In the hope of avoiding formal legal proceedings, we hereby request, on Sega's behalf, that your company immediately remove all infringing and illegal uses of Sega's marks, images and other intellectual property from your company's web site and transfer the "www.segasonic.net" domain name to Sega. Enclosed for your signature is Network Solutions, Inc.'s Name Change Agreement which we request that you complete and sign in the presence of a Notary Public. <p> We look forward to your written assurances to this effect no later than February 5, 2001. Please be advised that if your company fails to comply with this request, Sega will have no choice but to pursue its rights and remedies under the law, including damages (treble, statutory or other damages), injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs.  We look forward to your company's prompt compliance. <br> Very truly yours, <p> Ronit M. Alcheck</b></i> <p>There you have it. Sega wants the domain without a fight... I ask, if Sega goes on this site pounding like it's doing now.. Sonic sites are in danger. I really dunno what to think, I'm sure a lot of peeps don't either... <p>Tails SA<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.segasonic.net" target="_whole">SegaSonic.Net</a>

<hr>
<b><font color=red>Sonic Adventure 2</b> is set for tentative release June 21, 2001.</font>
<hr>
<font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog Advance</b> - The <u>first</u> Segasonic videogame on a Nintendo system - has been confirmed for the Game Boy Advance.</font> The game is reported to be along the lines of the Genesis 2D sidescroller, featuring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, with brand new levels unique to the Nintendo system. The game is currently scheduled for a worldwide release with the US system this July. Also confirmed have been "Puyo Puyo" and Sonic Team's "Chu Chu Rocket".
<hr>
<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
<hr>
<font color=red>Sega has confirmed that it is stopping production on all Dreamcasts and will be moving on to develop for other systems.</font> Theres a _LOT_ to this story and if you wish to learn more you can read the reprinted article and discuss your opinions on the situation at The Station Square Newsboard. The link to the full story & discussion can be found <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fsonichqcommunitystationsquarenewsandeditorials.showMessage?topicID=181.topic>here.</a>
<hr>
<font color=red>The landmark 100th issue of Archie Comic's "Sonic The Hedgehog" will be out, August 2001.</font> Titled "Darkness Falls", one of the main characters - a good guy - will go bad and become the "Ultimate Villian". The preview cover of Sonic #100 suggests it's Knuckles, but it MAY be a fake cover.
<hr>
