</font><p>Steven Butler has gone on to Knuckles - so who was to take the reigns of Sonic after Mr. Butler went byebye? Why none other than James Fry! And we've got the goods on him - his first works, his upcoming stuff, just who the guy is and a little of what makes him tick!</p>

</font>So sit back, relax and prepare to celebrate Sonic HQ's Anniversary as we interview current Sonic artist extraordinaire - James Fry. :O)</p>
<font face="arial", "helvetica" font size="2">

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> First can you give us some background on yourself? Like who you are
and
just what it is you do for those that don't know.

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Okay, sure. Some years ago, when I was illustrating novels based on
Marvel Comics characters for Byron Preiss Publications, I was asked to write
a bio. Might as well get some mileage out of it. Heck, some of it is even
true:  "Rocketed to Earth as an infant, JAMES W. FRY  escaped the destruction
of his home planet and grew to adulthood in Brooklyn, New York. In 1984,
seduced by the irresistible combination of insane deadlines and crippling
poverty, he embarked on a career as a freelance illustrator. James's credits
include STAR TREK and THE BLASTERS for DC Comics, NOMAD, MOON KNIGHT and
SLAPSTICK for Marvel Comics, THE NEW SHADOWHAWK for Image and COSMIC CREW for
the Children's Television Workshop. Himself a leading cause of stress-related
illness in editors, James's greatest unfulfilled ambition is to get one full
night of  guilt-free sleep."

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> How did you get started in comics?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Back in '84, my then-girlfriend and I were at a comics convention .
There was a panel discussion called "How To Break Into Comics". One of the
panelists, terrific inker and all-around Great Guy  Keith Williams talked
about Marvel Comics'  new Apprenticeship Program. If Art Director John Romita
Senior thought there was sufficient promise in your work, an aspiring artist
could get a staff job in the Bullpen doing art corrections and other
production work. The pay was onlty a gnat's whisker above minimum wage, BUT
you got hands-on experience with comics, had daily access to all the editors
and regular tips and instruction from John Sr. himself. At the time I was
working for the phone company, but when I found out that Marvel liked my work
enough to hire me, I dumped Ma Bell in nothing flat (thereby breaking my
parents' hearts) and never looked back.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> How did you get the job drawing for Archie Sonic?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> I was looking for work and my buddy Dan Slott suggested I call Justin
Gabrie at Archie to see if I could  maybe get a Sonic pin-up or two. Justin
and I had met a few years before, when he was an assistant editor at Marvel,
so he knew my work and gave me a shot. Turned out he liked my pin-up enough
to give me  Zone Wars, an inventory story that Dan had written, and liked my
work on THAT enough to offer me the regular book after Steven Butler's
upcoming departure.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What was it like working for Marvel? Specifically on SLAPSTICK
 And what drew you to Archie -
specifially the Sonic book?

 <b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Working for Marvel was just like working practically anywhere else---
some things are good, some things are bad, and the ratio can change
drastically from day to day. SLAPSTICK was like my baby, carried away by the
gypsies. Len Kaminski and I created the character and sold it to Marvel back
in 1988. We thought a funny superhero might provide some much-needed relief
from the growing tedency towards heroes who were grim and unpleasant and
difficult to tell from the villains. Marvel agreed---kind of. They bought the
character in '88, but didn't give us the green-light for the miniseries until
1991(!)and then spent precisely no time or effort on promoting it. On those
rare occasions that I could actually find a stray, lonely copy in a comics
shop, it was usually racked with the comics aimed at kids.  When I tried to
explain that , humorous or not, it was a superhero book  and should be placed
alongside SUPERMAN and SPIDER-MAN, store managers and proprietors usually
looked at me as if I were growing another head RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.  Very
disillusioning.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Rumors had been floating around that you may be leaving? :O( First let
me say a LOT of people like your work currently but we wanna know is it true
and are you still going to be drawing for the book? If you aren't then thank
goodness - but if you are, why? Lately you've been doing mostly
breakdowns...
<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>  Thanks for the kind words about my work. Feedback is always good, but
POSITIVE feedback is almost as good as chocolate!
Okay, the rumors of my departure are entirely accurate, BUT... I've already
gone and come back. Lemme 'splain, Lucy: Last summer I  was offered a sizable
sum of money to do a miniseries for another comics company. The amount of
work they were asking for and the speed with which they would need it were
such that I couldn't reasonably do the mini AND Sonic at the same time. And
as much as I had grown to love the little blue guy, drawing his adventures
pays less than half what I would make doing the same work for Marvel or DC.
(Sad but true. )If it weren't, I'd be happy to draw Sonic until they plant
me, but bills gotta get paid.... Anyway, J.Freddy was really cool about
giving me the time off to do the mini (A horrible experience, my absolute
worst in fifteen years of drawing comics!) and leaving the door open for me
to come back. The issues w/breakdowns were designed to give me a little breath
ing room and to accustom the readers to somebody else doing the finished
art.BUT... as I write this I'm just finishing my comeback issue (#88) and
having a ball.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What kind of environment do feel you work best under?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Solitude! Sometimes even have to turn the phone off and answer
messages later that day.But there must be background noise. TV or CDplayer !

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Where do you get inspiration for your own "style" of drawing the
characters? What types of materials do you use when you draw? Do you
consider the games or Sega of Japan's official art (like from the Sonic Jam
museum or Sonic Screensaver)? If that's the case, do you have any favorite
"scenes?"

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> My approach to drawing the characters, stylistically speaking, is kind
of a hodgepodge of  some of the artists that preceded me, chiefly Sam Maxwel,
SPAZ and Manny Galan, with a little of the Sonic Anime (I hope). Every new
artist is provided with a fist-thick reference file of model sheets, but as
you've no doubt noticed, there's a fair amount of leeway allowed for
interpretation. Thank goodness. I haven't seen much of the Sega of Japan
official art, but I'm darned curious about it, just as I'm hoping to get a
look at the UK SONIC comic.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Many have noticed the VERY LARGE Tenchi Muyo influence in your work. So
far we've seen background characters with hairdo's of Mihoshi, and Washu (I
don't think I've caught Ryoko or Ayeka yet). Considering that youre
obviously a huge anime fan - What anime influences you in your artwork most?
Why so much Tenchi and are you familiar with the Tenchi Universe in general?
And lastly what draws you TO anime?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> BUSTED!!!! Ah, well, I knew Tenchi fans would recognize what I was
doing. I haven't seen much --basically just caught a little at a friend's
house, so no, I'm not very familiar w/ the Tenchi Universe. But the little
bit that I've seen just captured my heart. Generally,  my artwork is
influenced by whatever I've seen lately. I've been enjoying the work of
Rumiko Takahashi recently, and SONIC#88 may show some influence from Kia
Asamiya's STEAM DETECTIVES, of all things. As for what draws me to any
particular anime, that depends entirely on which way the wind is blowing. It
can be the characters, like in URUSEI YATSURA and RANMA, or action, like
LUPIN. Sometimes the first thing that attracts me may be some nifty-lookin'
design elements, but I stick around because I find the story so
compelling,like EVANGELION. Sometimes I fall madly in love (PROJECT A-KO),
and sometimes I think "I wanna be that guy if I ever grow up (PORCO ROSSO).

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What was your true "First Sonic Story" - "Guardian Heroes", "Back To
Business", or "Zone Wars: Prelude"?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> As I mentioned above, "Zone Wars" was my FIRST.Actually, it didn't
become "Zone Wars: Prelude" until Freddy decided to turn it into two separate
stories:He had Dan Slott write a new closing page that turned the whole
"Sally Moon" scenario into a self-contained story . The remainder of the
original story w/ Doctor Kintobor and the kaiju versions of the Freedom
Fighters was turned into a separate tale altogether, with the  addition of
the Sonicaman framing sequence. Spaz  (apparently an even bigger Gatchaman
fan than I, which is going some) designed the characters and I was supposed
to draw that part of the story as well, but ran out of time after it was
scheduled.
          While we're  here, I'd like to address something that was written
about before I joined Ron B's little group: I'd heard that  "Sally Moon"  was
much reviled by SONIC fans and largely perceived as some sort of sinister
plot on ARCHIE's part to separate unsuspecting children from their
much-needed milk money or something. Frankly, I was surprised to see such
sinister motives ascribed to  a harmless joke. Writer Dan Slott and I were
just having a little fun with SONIC's Japanese roots. This might have been
more evident if the story had been published in its original form; besides
Sally Moon, you'd have seen(and have seen by now) Bunnie Rabbot's
GOJIRA-style spines and tail, Tails's DEVIL-MAN-style brow-wings and the
Giant Kintobor's resemblance to GIGANTOR with a sizable amount of ULTRAMAN
for good measure. The important thing is, if you didn't like the Sally Moon
story on its own merits as a story, fine,you have that right. But if you
thought it was part of some sinister conspiracy by Archie Comics to  make a
fast buck, SNAP OUT OF IT!!!
sorry
just had to get that off my chest
we now return to our regular scheduled interview

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Had you been given any backstory on Sonic prior to your drawing
assignments? What association did you have knowing about the cahracter other
than the videogames? Had you read the comic before?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> When I did the pin-up and my first story, I was sent the previous 3 or
4 issues of the comic just to get a feel for what the characters looked like.
I had seen a couple of the VERY early issues way back when, but, of
course,the look and tone of the book had changed considerably. When I became
the regular penciler, they sent me both seasons of the SatAM cartoon on tape
and a couple of dozen issues of the comic along with a sizeable chunk of
KNUCKLES' run. I watched both versions of the American cartoons, but didn't
like either one as much as the two half-hour Japanese cartoons I'd seen. The
SatAM stuff seemed to have some potential to it, but I rarely thought it was
fully realized. I liked SONIC as a character a great deal,though... I thought
of him as being a lot like SUPERMAN: a terrific character who deserved better
stories!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> That full page spread in Sonic 77 - The one where everyone gathered in
Knothole for the evacuation out of Robotropolis with Hong Kong Phooey and
every other character known to man it it. ^_^ How long did it take you to
draw that sucker and were there any specific characters in there of interest
that we should know about?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Wow! I don't remember how long it took to draw that sequence, and if I
did, I'd probably just start crying again. It was fun, but it was WORK, and
as the New Kid In Town, I was probably trying too hard to impress. Crowd
scenes are among my least favorite things to draw (just ask Karl Bollers;
I've threatened his life more than once) so I often wind up putting in
familiar faces just to make things more fun. Kudos to J. Fred for not making
me take them out. I used to do this kind of thing all the time back during my
STAR TREK days: Jor-El was a member of the Federation Council, Harry Osborn
attended Starfleet Academy with James Kirk ,the list goes on. And speaking of
lists, I'll be dipped if I can remember everyone who shows up in that scene.
In fact, you never know when someone's lawyer may be nearby. Maybe I
shouldn't be talking about this at all...

<p><center><img src=images/fry2k2.jpg></center>

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What are your views between where the Sonic comic has been - i.e Moving
away from The Sonic SatAM Cartoon continuity to its own continuity set up by
Mr. Bollers to SA to where the comic is going now? Why do you think that
Sonic fans (well, at least half of them anyway) show so much animocity at
major changes that deviate from the original SatAM Storyline while the other
half want more Sega Sonic influece?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> I recently weighed in on a similar topic on the board: It's hard to
keep all those balls in the air at once. I think Karl is doing pretty well at
what has to be a very difficult job. For every group of SONIC fans you make
happy, there's another group ready to burn you in effigy(if not in your
living room)! Generally, when people find that they like a character, they
like the FIRST version of that character that they encounter;that version
feels "right" to them and any attempt to change things or move the character
and his setting is percieved as a betrayal of sorts. The trouble is, when
characters appear in multiple media and each medium takes a different
approach to the character, the fan base gets divided into different camps.
Imagine the confusion that somebody who discovered THE INCREDIBLE HULK on TV
back in the seventies must have felt if they decided to  pick up one of the
comic books: "What the @%$#%$& is THIS?! He's BULLETPROOF? He can TALK? BRUCE
Banner?!That's not the Hulk I know!"
       
<p>SONIC fandom is a lot like that: the different versions of the
character are different enough to create dissent, and since the comic offers
the most frequent exposure to the character, everybody wants to see
"their"version of the Hedgehog take center stage.You've heard the saying that
"No man may serve two masters", but that's just what anyone trying to write
SONIC has to do. Personally I think an approach not unlike Warner Bros.
BATMAN and SUPERMAN cartoons might help. The writers and artists on those
shows use elements from virtually EVERY version of those characters that has
been done, and the resultingpatchwork is both satisfying and entertaining.
But the trouble with that kind of thing is that you run the risk of achieving
the opposite effect: instead of making everybody happy, you could wind up
ticking them ALL off. Who could blame you for not wanting to take that chance?

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Do you think the Dreamcast Sonic of today is anything the same or as
cool or as popular as the Genesis Sonic of yesterday?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Frankly, I think the Dreamcast Sonic is one of the coolest things I've
ever seen. I just hope I've been straightforward enough with my answers up
'til now that people don't read that and think "Yeah, but he works for these
guys,he HAS to say that kinda thing."

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> How much influence does Sega have on the art in the comic? How much
influence do you think Archie has on Sega, Sonic wise? Do you think Sega Of
America is partly responsible for Sonic's lower poularity today?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> In my experience, Sega hasn't had all that much say in the art. I
fiddled w/Sally's hair a bit in the first few pages of #76 and was told that
I had gone beyond the limits of what was allowed vis-a-vis deviating from the
model, but since then, nobody has said "boo" to me. As for what influence
Archie may have over Sega, I haven't a clue. Somebody closer to the editorial
end of things might have some insights on that one.
          
<p>As for Sonic's diminished popularity, I don't realy think Sega of
America has all that much to do with it, if anything at all. The popularity
of ANY character or property experiences peaks and valleys.Times change,
people change, tastes change.It doesn't even necessarily mean that the
quality has diminshed. A thing can be every bit as good as it ever was, or
even better, but sooner or later, the public has had enough.  You just never
know....

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What would you say is your favorite comic?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Boy, I hate that question. I've always had trouble narrowing things
down to just one; I like so many different comics for so many different
reasons! But if you held a gun to my head (and if you're a comic book editor,
you probably have) I'd have to say either Will Eisner's SPIRIT comics of the
Forties and Fifties, or Jack Cole's PLASTIC MAN from the same period. The
Spirit because it includes brilliant examples of virtually every type of
story ever written.  Plastic Man because Cole was an absolutely fantastic
comedian, capable of being wildly lunatic and winkingly subtle, often on the
same page, sometimes in the same panel!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Who were some of your favorite artists that you looked up to? How have
they influenced you?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Oooo....lemme see. Like most of my generation of artists, I grew up
worshipping Jack Kirby. He managed to epitomize both raw power and believable
humanity. I liked the slick design sense of longtime Flash artist Carmine
Infantino. I admired Gil Kane's fluidity of movement and powerful dynamics,
Steve Ditko's cockeyed stylization and John Romita ,Senior's clean bold lines
and beautiful women. Now let me see if I can come up with any names that
DON'T go back to the Mesozoic era: Alan Davis is a freakin' genius of an
artist. That there Joe Madureira's pretty nifty,too. Paul Smith's economy of
line is a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Steve Rude's work makes my heart
beat faster, as do Bruce Timm, Garcia-Lopez, Walt Simonson, Frank
Miller...too many, too many... next question, please!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> As someone who has seen some of the Sonic Adventure Adaption first hand
- what has been the BEST, HARDEST, and most FRUSTRATING part of drawing it?
What steps did you as an artist, go in drawing and layout out the story, and
how did you feel when Knuckles was cancelled and most of your slots in the
book were reduced to 9 pages?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Well, I asked for that, didn't I? 'S a big question, yo. And the
trouble is, I was absent for most of the SONIC ADVENTURE stuff. The BEST part
was getting to draw  the little bit that I could, the HARDEST part was having
to bail after the earliest city scenes, and the most FRUSTRATING thing was
not getting to draw SUPER SONIC. I'd have jumped up and down on a box of
kittens to draw that sequence after I saw that part of the game, but alas...
         
<p>Drawing that story involved some interesting measures: It was begun
months before the Dreamcast would be on sale here in the states. So SPAZ
obtained a Japanese version of the game, played it from beginning to end and
taped the whole shootin' match. Then, the tape was mailed to every one of the
artists who would be working on the SA adaptation so we could copy it for
reference. In the plot, Karl would refer to a particular sequence in the game
and we'd  just scan to it and draw.
        
<p>As for KNUCKLES's cancellation, I was heartbroken. Not because of my
sequences being cut down; they needed the space to tell Knux's part of the
story and my ego ain't that fragile. No, I was just upset because I enjoyed
the book and was sorry to see it go. If anything, I like Knuckles at least as
much as  Sonic. His book seemed like a perfect companion title: Similar
enough that it fed your need for additional Sonic-style adventure, but
different enough that it still had its own distinctive personality. Think
HERCULES/XENA or BUFFY/ ANGEL.

<p><img src=images/fry2k3.jpg align=right>

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> For those that don't know - what exactly is a breakdown?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> I'll ignore the OVERWHELMING temptation to make a painfully obvious
joke and just say that breakdowns are loose drawings, sketches, really,
usually done as guidelines for another artist or to give a rough idea of the
book's pacing and storytelling.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Can you explain the steps in how you get a comic book ready from your
perspective. What goes into it, and how do you get assignements? How do you
know how and where to lay out the story

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> I get a plot in the mail,usually along with Archie Comics' drawing
paper and vouchers. Karl's plot tells me how many panels there are per page,
what the action in each panel is and usually some indication of what the
dialogue might be. That last part is fairly important,since the actual
dialogue is written AFTER the story is drawn and I need to leave Karl enough
room . (Marvel Comics pioneered this approach to comics in the 60's, and it's
largely credited with making comic books more collaborative creatively).
Knowing how or where to lay things out is no big trick: when you
read the story, you visualize each scene. Sometimes the writer has a
particular angle in mind, or a design element he'll ask you to include. After
I've read the plot from beginning to end, I start to lay the story out with
thumbnail drawings at about 1/4 size. When I've finished half the story, I
blow the thumbnails up to full size, trace them on to the art boards with a
lightbox and turn them into finished drawings, smoothing out rough edges and
adding details. Then I do the same thing with the second half.  On a couple
of occasions, when pressed for time,  I've enlisted the help of my longtime
friend Frank Strom (creator of Monkey Khan) to help with the thumbnails. As I
finish a few pages at a time, I send them off to J.Fred, who faxes reduced
Xeroxes of the pages to Karl for dialoguing and sends the originals to the
letterer.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What is it like working with Karl Bollers and J.F. Gabrie? With Karl
specifically do you converse regularly between assignments and how do you
work with each other in sync to producing the finished product?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>  I'm much more likely to get in touch with a writer I'm working with
if something is unclear and confusing. Karl's stuff, though, is generally
solid and straightforward , so he doesn't hear from me much, unless it's to
beg him to lay off the crowd scenes. And JFG may be the best editor I've ever
worked for. He has been amazingly cooperative, supportive and patient,
willing to help me work through some major league screw-ups  with a sense of
humor and answering even my stupidest questions with a straight face. And
I've asked some doozies! One morning, while in the early stages of working on
my first regular issue of STH, I was monumentally sleep-deprived and unable
to find any of the small mountain of reference material I'd been sent. I
called JF and asked if we had ever seen the exterior of Robotnik's
headquarters.Not much!!! Just in every episode of the SatAM show! And damn
near every issue of this damn comic!!! A patient man is J.F.Gabrie...

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> The design of those police in Sation Square in Sonic 81 and 82 look a
bit Mega Man-ish? I take it you're a fan of the blue bomber as well?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Kinda. Actually,any similarity between those cops and Mega-Man was
purely coincidental. I've seen the cartoon a number of times, mostly because
I liked  the design of some of the characters. My girlfriend's son, on the
other hand, can quote chapter and verse  on probably any aspect of MegaMan
you'd care to bring up!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Speaking of design - while conversing with you on the mailing list I
was surprised and impressed that it WASN'T Spaz, but you who had done the
designs on recent characters - the most surprising being designing Zonic The
Zone Cop who appears regularly in the Sonic Super Specials. How do you
basically come up with a design, what was the basis for Zonic's design and
what other characters can you say that you have designed for the book? (Did
you have any input on the new design of the Shadow Swatbots BTW?)

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Actually I haven't gotten to design many ongoing characters in this
book.  Zonic was mine,and his uniform was a piece of cake. I just kinda
thought "Hmmm....extradimensional law officer, huh? What would one of those
look like?" And the answer was "Judge Dredd!" A nip here and a tuck there and
a pair of those "rabbit-ear thingumees for a more Japanese look and voila!
Zonic! And of course, I got to do Giant Kintobor and the monster versions of
the Freedom Fighters, but the odds that you'll see them again are slim.
Except for Zonic and the new Swat-Bots (yes, they're mine. I thought they
should have those classic Japanese Robot proportions.) the overwhelming
majority of the design work on this book is from SPAZ. And I liked his cover
drawing of Zonic WAY more than my own anyway.
             AS for what goes into designing a character, for me, it's a list
of questions, from "What does this character DO?" and "What's his/her
personality like?" because those things often have a material effect on a
character's appearance. Nearly as important are "What am I in the mood to
draw today?" and "Will I be sick of drawing that six months from now?" . And,
of course, "Why is man born only to suffer and die?" and "When's lunch?"

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Bunnie Rabbot. Who is responsible for HER redesign - from the
"Popeye"-like forearms to her new sleeker smoother look? Can you give us
some insight on this and how it came about to redesign her? Did it provide
anything of a challenge for you?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> A challenge? You betcha!!! 'Cause I liked her the way she was!!! As I
understand it Bunnie was redesigned (SPAZ again) in response to complaints
from the fans that she wasn't sexy enough or something. Well, I know that my
own tastes are at odds with those of the average american male---figure-wise
I prefer  ample to petite. But hormonal considerations aside (we are, after
all , talkin' about doggone CARTOON RABBIT!!!), Bunnie's old body was more
interesting to draw. Now that she's been streamlined and Amy Rose has become
a full-fledged teenager (a change I support), most of this series' female
characters seem to have the same body type (except maybe Dulcy and Rosie) and
I personally find that DULL,DULL,DULL!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Of all the Freedom Fighters, which do you like drawing the most?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Of the Freedom Fighters, my favorite to draw would be Big Blue
himself, and before her reboot, Bunnie would have been a close second.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Robotnik's old look (SatAM) VS Robotnik's new look (Sonic Adventure)?
Honestly - what do you think is better? ^_^

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> That's another tough call, 'cause I like elements of each version. But
I'll admit to a preference for the old school version because of a personal
bias toward evil masterminds with CAPES!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> During your time illustrating Sonic & Knux there must have been some
issues that you regard as your own favorites. What are they, in terms of
your own work? Have a favorite character?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Of the stuff that's seen print so far,I'd have to say #76 is my fave.
I'm very proud of that crowd scene, and some of the action stuff was a pretty
big hoot as well. But I think #88 will look pretty darn decent when it comes
out,too. As for favorite characters, aside from Sonic himself, I'd have to
give a first-place tie to Knuckles. I RELATE to a grumpy guy with dreadlocks.
Heck, if I could just get that gliding thing down, there'd be no telling us
apart!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Do you ever play the Sonic games for inspiration?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Believe it or else, I've only ever played at my friends' homes! If I
had a game system of my own, I'd never get anything done!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Have you seen any of the television series (Sonic SatAM, Sonic
Underground, Adventures of STH), the Sonic anime, or the Archie comic
series, and if so, what are your opinions on them?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> I think I've covered most of this in my answers to previous questions
and I'm doing enough repeating myself as is. Would anyone like to hear a song?

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> I noticed in our email your affinity especially for the anime. What do
you think of the American version of Sonic as opposed to the Japanese
version? Why would you prefer the Japanese over the American, and why do you
think that its not likely that we'll see more of the Japanese influence on
the book?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>  The SatAM stuff, while clearly enjoyed by adults, seems much more
specifically aimed at a juvenile audience. I find that the Japanese cartoons
are more sophisticated, both visually and conceptually, and that just appeals
to me more. Understand, I'm not saying that I favor an approach that excludes
a youger audience, just one that works harder to include an older one. As for
why I imagine the Japanese influence taking a backseat, that's just a
perception thing: my admittedly limited awareness of Sonic fandom gives me
the impression that the fans who prefer the American approach may outnumber
the Japanese camp. Maybe that's so, maybe that's not, but if the intention
of those guiding the comic is to keep the fans happy, then the  larger camp
is likelier to get its way.
         Not that ther'll be NO Japanese influence in there. Quite the
contrary;when I took over the art duties , J. Fred gave me carte blanche to
add as much manga/anime stuff to the look of the book as I felt comfortable
with. And recent SA-related developments have brought a greater resemblance
to the game and the original Japanese stuff. So maybe I have no idea what I'm
talking about. Wouldn't be the first time. Won't be the last!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> I had also noticed you took a look at Sonic Ideal from the link on our
front page. What do you think of it? ^_^

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>Very nice. The art by Abigail Ryder is bright and energetic, and the
story by David Bulmer is charming.  The thing I admire most about both story
and art is the amount of personality conveyed. The characters LOOK cool and
interesting,to the degree that if you didn't know much about them, you'd WANT
to. And the easy banter between Sonic and Tails seems relaxed and natural,
like real friends. Another cool thing is the use of silent panels. Silence is
a technique I sometimes consider criminally underused, in comics as well as
movies and TV. But sometimes hanging back and letting the pictures tell the
story can be very effective. It takes a writer who's confident enough to do
it and an artist who's capable of that kind of storytelling. I'm lookin'
forward to issue two.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What basic drawing advice would you give a young artist? Do you have
any particular way that you start drawing a figure/background/angle?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Most art books will tell you to think of the object you want to draw
as a series of connected geometric shapes. You know, spheres for heads, rods
for arms, cones for God-Knows-What. Good advice. Cause once you get the hang
of that, it works with everything,whether you're drawing Aunt Gertie's cat or
Doctor Diablo's Ionization Nebulizertm.
             Another thing to remember is to study the human figure. I know,
it's a lot more fun to draw  hardware and explosions and whatnot, and that
stuff is certainlly flashy as all get-out, but you'll probably discover that
you have a wider range of options if you can render the human face and figure
in a manner that appears believable. It's true, most comic art is about
exaggeration. But many have found that it's much easier to learn the
believable first and move on to the exaggerated than vice-versa. 'Cause in
all likelihood,you will be called upon to draw both. Frequently the quiet,
human moments are necessary to provide a counterpoint to the slam-bang action
stuff.
           Finally, of course, the customary admonition: Draw,draw,draw!
Never stop practicing, never stop learning.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What makes drawing a comic fun? Are the time constraints stressful?
What part of your job do you like best?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Many would insist that what makes drawing comics fun is the adventure
of it all, the fantasy element, the wish fulfillment that goes with much of
the subject matter. Others love the sheer joy of the creative act. Or getting
to finally have a hand in chronicling the adventures of a favorite character.
I would,of course agree. But what's most fun is the huge truck full of cash
that they back up to my door every week and the hundreds and hundreds of
well-carved young women who stand ready to do my bidding. Or did I just dream
that?
            Like many artists, I'm married to my job. In fact, we have two
children,now: Bleeding Ulcer and Big Chair Butt. We're especially proud of
Big Chair Butt ;he's starting college in the fall.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What do you consider your biggest positives, strengths and negatives,
weaknesses in your artwork? Do you feel that you can improve - if so how?
What fields do you think you don't need to improve on?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>   I think my strengths and weaknesses are inextricably linked, though,
which can make for some tough sledding. Por ejemplo, I tend to be a
perfectionist, picking over tiny details or constantly redrawing to try and
make things look better. That's a plus. The minus is that that kind of thing
gets time-consuming and there's always a schedule that must be met. Another
thing I consider a strength is my ability to assimilate elements of other
people's stle into my own. It has certainly helped me grow as an artist, just
as bacon cheesebugers have helped me grow as a fat guy. The flip side of
that, however, is that sometimes my brain gets lazy and I  decide to slavishly
 copy what someone else did as opposed to coming up with my own approach. In
comics, this is known as Buckler's Disease. People who work  in motion
pictures call it The DePalma Syndrome.
           
<p>As for improvement, there's always room for that (and Jell-o). I
think exposing myself (DON"T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!) to a wider range of
influences might help, as would relaxing and not second-guessing myself so
much. The latter would certainly at least imoprove my speed , which would
make my oft-neglected girlfriend happier. (HI, RoByn! Put down the gun,
honey, I'm almost finished.....)

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Ever think about guest writing an issue? ^__^

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Frankly, no. So far, I haven't had any story ideas that I think are
worth pestering J.Fred over. If I ever do, though, I'll be calling him
morning, noon and night begging for an opening!

<p><center><img src=images/fry2k4.jpg></center>

MG: We had heard a rumor that Karl Bollers may be leaving the book soon.
Danny Fingeroth - a previous editor at Marvel will be on the book writing a
2 part Metal Sonic story with issue 86 or 87 I believe and is the first new
writer since the days after "Endgame" (Sonic 50). Any insight on if or why
Karl may be leaving?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> To the best of my knowledge, Karl isn't going anywhere. The Fingeroth
story (shudder) is most likely inventory being cleared. For those of you not
in the know, an "inventory story " is a story that the editor purchases,
basically with the intent of using it to plug a hole in the schedule. Some
inventories wind up appearing in Specials or Annuals,some never get published
at all. Shortly before i went on hiatus, I know Archie issued an edict that
some of the inventory built up in the SONIC office be used, so you may see
the occasional issue here and there by people other than the book's regular
creative team. No cause for alarm, and sometimes these things can yield
interesting and entertaining results.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> I'll be blunt - Can ya give us any spoliers James? Sonic fans need to
know! ^______^

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> I would LOVE to offer up something juicy, but honestly:I got nothin!
Having only just gotten back aboard myself, I'm still playing catch-up. I can
tell you that  the King is badly injured while leading a siege on Robotnik's
headquarters... and that upcomiing issues will feature Antoine, Bunnie and
Amy Rose joining forces w/that "Robin Hood" Hedgehog (whose actual name
escapes me) against 'Toine's roboticized dad. Other than that, your guess is
as good as mine.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What are your future plans for your career? Do you have a concept for a
book, or animation?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Yeah, sure, there's a pile of stuff I hope to do, from a novel that
may never be finished to various screenplays that I never seem to find the
time to wrtite. And of course, there's a number of comics concepts I'd like
to get off the ground one day, assuming the industry's slow, lingering and
painful death can somehow be arrested, or even, dare I hope, reversed. Some
would be books  that I wrote and drew all by my lonesome. Other projects
would be collaborations with longtime buds like Dan (SUPERMAN ADVENTURES ,
REN AND STIMPY) Slott or Len (BLOODSHOT, JLA:FOREIGN BODIES) Kaminski. Kurt
Busiek and I have even discussed someday resurrecting THE LIBERTY PROJECT, a
book we created for Eclipse comics ,back when there was just the one big
landmass.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What do you think about the Knuckles comic dying?

FRY2K : >snif<

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Will you ever work on any other specials coming up? What are you
working on right now?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> The regular title keeps me pretty busy, but if something I
REEEAAAALLLLY wanna do rears its ugly head, special-wise, should happen to
come up,then maybe...

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Is there much room for "Add libbing" at all if the artist thinks of
something different they may want to throw in?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>  The whole point of working "Marvel Style" is supposed to leave the
door open for that kind of thing, but I generally try to hew as close to the
writer's intent as possible. If I come up with something that I think is just
TOO COOL to resist, I call the guy and we talk about it.  Most  writers seem
open to compromise if it's discussed beforehand. It strikes me as just good
manners and common sense: If the writer planned to fill a particular scene
with emotional revelations full of dramatic impact, you don't wanna be the
guy who drew all the characters in party hats and rubber noses!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Has your work changed you in any way?

FRY 2K: Yes. I'm taller now. And much younger, too.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> If you had the choice to be in any other career, what would it be?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b>  Hurm. Been trying to figure that one out for a few years now, ever
since this whole "comical book"  dealie started goin' south. Probably some
other kind of visual storytelling medium. >>>HORRIBLE CLICHE ALERT!!!<<<
>>>BRACE YOURSELVES!!! HERE IT COMES!!!<<< What I'd really like to do is
direct.   Whew. That was close. Stand down, people. All clear.

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Who are your favorite characters in comics you've grown up with?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> Geez, there's bunches of 'em. Like Josie's pre-Pussycat pals Sock and
Pepper (anybody reading this who's old enough to remember them should help me
find my walker). And Herbie (the Fat Fury) Popnecker. And Hot Stuff. And the
superheroes! The guys I always wanted to BE like: Superman, Captain America,
Captain Marvel ( the original, of course), Luke Cage....and the guys I
thought I WAS like: Man-Bat, the Creeper, Howard The Duck, Luke Cage, (yes, I
know he's on both lists)...and my hands-down absolute fave--THE BEAST!!!
Smartmouth hairy guy who just won't shut the heck up!!! CAN YOU DIG IT?!

<b><p><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> And finally - What kind of challenge would you like to pursue now? And
what is your greatest achievement in the art field?

<b><p><font color=red>FRY2K:</font></b> My greatest achievement in the art field hasn't happened yet( How's
THAT for evasive action?) and the challenge I hope to pursue noe is a NAP!
I'm exhausted!
