<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Thank you for taking time out to talk with us. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> You're welcome. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> What first gave you the idea to start Sonikku Team? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Well, it wasn't really my idea. It was Hedgesmfg's. When we first came up with the idea to create a Sonic game and he suggested we form a team. So we did. Hedgesmfg also came up with the team's name. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Why did you want to create a Metal Sonic game, instead of a regular Sonic game? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Well, Hedgesmfg basically created that game. I think he created MSQ because he wanted to make a different game. There are alot of regular SOnic games, and MSQ is, well, different. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Hedgesmfg has contributed alot to the SOnikku Team, much more then I have. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> What is your position at Sonikku Team? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> I'm the president, basically because I was the one who created the idea to create Sonic Quest.  
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> We hear that you have a new game coming out called Sonic Quest. How much % is done with that game? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Yeah. We havn't gotten very far with it. If I were to say percentage it would be 5%. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Is it to early to quote you on a release date? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Yes. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Way too early. Heh. But I would say it should be compelted within a year or less. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> There are very many struggling fan-game creators out there. Would you like to give them any tips on making games? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Oh, yes. Try to make your game some-what original. Don't use overused midis. DO NOT rush the game. If you can try to make the whole game fan-made. It would show that you worked hard on the game. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Make it have a good plot, and make cutscenes skipable. IMO, watching cutscnes when you don't want to is extremly boring and takes away fro mthe gameplay. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> What program do you reccomend to make games with? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Hm.. I have both MMF and CnC and I think they are both great. The bad thing about MMF is its surface layout. It's some-what complicated, andd, IMO, it takes way too long to start up. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Do you have any info on any upcoming games past Sonic Quest? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Well, I cannot call it info, but I can say the games that might be made. AmyRose the Hedgehog, Metal Sonic's Revenge(sequal to Metal Sonic Quest), Sonic the Freedom Fighter, and I think that's it. Also, during the process of Sonci Quest being made mini games will be made, which will probably have a zone or two. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Do you have a personal favorite fangame? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> I think Sonic Brick is the best! It's fun and addictive! 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> When was Sonikku Team founded? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Hm... About a year ago. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Are there any useful codes for any of Sonikku Team's games? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Hm.. not really. I don't remember a code to MSQ.. I can get back to ya when I do do find it out, again. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Do you have any favorite Sonic sites? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> I like Sonic HQ, SFGHQ, The Sonic Zone, tSf, Team Artail, and SegaSonic.net. I think those sites are the best. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Is there anything else you'd like to add in this interview? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Well, there's not much.. but.. Look foward to the Sonic Quest sprites to be done within a couple of months, perhaps less if I get more tiem to work on them. Expect another Sonic Quest demo out within  a couple of months, too! 
 <p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Speaking of sprites, what is your favorite place to get character sprites? 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Sonic Fan Games HQ. It has a great variety of sprites, and it is the best place to get them from. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Well, I don't see much more to ask you. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> Okie Dokie. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> Thank you for taking time out of the day to let us interview you. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> It's been a pleasure. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> No problem. 
<p><font color="000099">
<b>SHQ:</b> We'll see you later. 
<p><font color="990000">
<b>CyberKnux:</b> See ya!</p>
