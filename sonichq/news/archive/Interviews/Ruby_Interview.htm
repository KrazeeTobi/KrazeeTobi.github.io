<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Thanks for coming to this interview with Sonic HQ.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: When I invited you to to do this interview, you
said that you might not be in the Sonic-Net much longer. Could you explain?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Yes. The fandom
hasn't been what it used to be for me, so I'm leaving it. Ruby's Realm, my main site is down. The studio
might not be around much longer either...

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Do you think you might come back to the fandom
in the future?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: I may.. I will stay
in it in the roleplay world, such as MUCKing and the occasional chat. As far as posting on webpages, <br>
newsgroups, mailing lists, and creating new Sonic-themed things
go, however, I'm afraid I'm dropping out.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: This is the end for Sonic Ideal?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Nope. David Bulmer,
my co-creator of the series, is taking 
over that.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Who will do the art?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Well, Dave's friend,
Abigail, who is a terrific artist, will be featured in some of the issues. Of course, if anyone thinks they
might want to lend a hand, I'm sure he'd be glad to get extra help!

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Where can readers find the comic, since it won't
be on your 
site?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Ah, we're working on
that. I might just leave the Sonic Ideal 
part of the Studio up and let Dave take it over.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: What were your goals when you were creating
Sonic Ideal?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Well, I had seen how
many people were disappointed with Archie's Sonic comics lately (me included). I decided to do
something 
about it by capturing the essence of what really turned the
audience on in 
those books. This included things like the Mecha Madness Special,
the 
Knuckles series, and various Saturday morning-ish issues. 

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: How did you decide on the characterizations?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>:Ah, well the SatAM
show was a big influence on Sonic and 
Sally. Tails was more like the anime version. The Chaotix were
based 
mainly from the game manual information that I expanded on. Some
things, 
like Espio's chlostrophobia, had to be dug up from a Japanese
site.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Will Bash Bat still be available online?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: I think so. I haven't
had time to update it as much as I want 
to "The Green" will be posted soon I hope.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: What were your goals in crafting Bash Bat's
story?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Ah, that was just
incorporating things I found interesting into 
a world that was totally mine.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: How did you create the characters? Did you
create any 
character for certain goals, such as advancing the story in a
particular way, 
expressing a viewpoint through their actions, or using them as a
metaphor 
for something?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Bas represents not
only the hero character, but also a drastic 
change in personality. At first he's more leap before you look,
then as the 
series goes on, he becomes as goos a leader as Zing was. 
Celene is one of my favorite characters since she's so
mysterious. Her past 
is quite vague, but really gets some substance later on.


<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Were any of them based on real people? ;-)

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Ah yes. Jaide has
alot of myself in her. She's quiet and usually 
gives up more than she should. Her story doesn't have a happy
ending.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Is there anything else you'd like to say about
Bash in this interview?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Not really. I just
hope that I can get the series where I want 
to while keeping the audience.


<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: In your opinion, how important is it for a
spinoff such as 
Archie's to remain accurate to the original SEGA Sonic, or any
other 
established story?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Hmmm... if they want
to be taken seriously it's very important 
that they stick with established characters. To spin off such
things as an 
Image crossover, or to incorporate nepotism as part of your main
continuity 
is a move that some people will look at and think of it as
nothing more than 
a freelance project.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: How do you feel about the Sonic Anime,
Fleetway's Sonic 
the Comic, SatAM, and AoSTH?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: The Sonic Anime is
excellent. I got into the Sonic-fandom 
through the games, and I really wish there was more SegaSonic
influence 
over here. The Fleetway comic is also very cool. I've only seen a
few 
issues, but what I saw I was very impressed with. SatAM was good,
but 
was never given the chance to strut its stuff. AoStH was weak. 
Unfortunately, it was SoA's favorite version. That says alot
about Sega's 
idea of cool.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: You said earlier that you had been disappointed
in the 
recent Archie comics. What do you think was the turning point
where they 
went downhill? How do you feel about Archie's Sonic before that
point? 
What did you like, and what did you dislike?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Ah, the turning point
for me was Endgame... right before I left 
I understand they were throwing a Prince Elias at us... What the
HECK 
was that? We already have Sally.. she doesn't need some other
Archie char 
stealing her position and issue time.. It's been like that since
Endgame.. 
Bunch of things that would make the worst fanfic writer say,
"Oh lordy I 
can't believe they're pulling this junk!" I really liked
anything before that. I 
saw the comics as having a steady continuity. Things like The
issue #25, 
Mecha Madness, and the Knuckles Quest were all quite interesting.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: What is your opinion of the Knuckles series?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Hmm.. to tell you the
truth... I liked the character before the 
continuing series. I will admit that the current issues are very
well written, 
but the character needs some work. I enjoyed Knuckles' personna
in the 
Mecha Madness issue. He was a rebel; someone who could take care
of 
himself. Now he has parents, more enemies, and even a girlfriend
to worry 
about. 

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: How did you first become a Sonic fan?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: The games. When I saw
the commercial for the first Sonic 
game, I was quite intrigued. When I got the Genesis and the Sonic
games, I 
was hooked.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: You're a great artist, any 
comments to people out there on how to draw better?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Of course.. If you're
really serious about your art, you should 
practice every day. Once it becomes a joy rather than a task,
you'll know 
you have something. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with
different 
styles, especially realism.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Any comments to people about writing?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Ah, that's pretty
much all the same idea.. Write often, 
especially when you get an idea. Experiment with it. If you want
your own 
series, develop the basic outline for it, then add details like
characters and 
such later.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Is there any message you'd like to leave for the
Sonic fans 
on the internet?

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Well, just that I've
had a blast working and corresponding with the people I have met in the fandom and I wish them all
well.

<p><b>Sonic HQ</b>: Well, I guess this concludes our interview.
Thanks!

<p><b>Ruby Echidna</b>: Sure thing! Thanks for having me! :)
