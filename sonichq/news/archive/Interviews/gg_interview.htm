</font><p>Greetings! Many of you have heard of it, some of you have experienced it - but few have ever met the Gibbon and come away TRULY sane. ^___^ And now, here for you wonderful readers, an interview with Green Gibbon - owner of the Neo Green Hill Zone, lover of Midori, and worshipper of Drano.</p>

</font>Be afraid...be VERY afraid! :O)</p>
<font face="arial", "helvetica" font size="2">

</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>First can you give us some background on yourself? Like who you are
and
just what it is you do for those that don't know.

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Weeeell, I prefer to be known as Green Gibbon!, and I guess I'm being
interviewed here because of my work on The GHZ (aka "Neo Green Hill Zone"),
which is a Sonic Team fansite that - if nothing else - has loads of
personality.  (And free Drano!)

</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How did you become a Sonic fan?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>You mean there's still someone who doesn't know?  Okay, let's see if I
can run through this again without sounding cheesy: My first experience with
Sonic came in the form of a Sega Genesis display case at my local Toys "R"
Us.  I believe it was winter of '91, and my tender ten-year-old will could
not guard my soul from this mesmerizing blue challenger.  I became
hopelessly entranced and from the second I grabbed the shiny black
controller, I was in another world.  The machine was set to start over at
the end of Act 1, but I played that Act over and over until my parents had
to drag me away kicking and screaming (sometimes literally).  I was a
changed man.  The rest is history.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>In becoming a fan of Sonic, has there been a particular video game in
the series that has influenced you in any way and why?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Sonic 1 is the obvious choice, but if I had to select one (and I guess
you're making me), I'd say Sonic CD.  There's no question that CD sports a
more anime-esque flair than others in the series, and that had a big impact
on me at the time.  I remember for months the only Sonic art I drew was
"Japanimation Sonic", as I called it.  Needless to say, that got me off on
anime, manga, and all that good stuff, which has lead to a general interest
in Japanese culture.  Omoshiroi, desu ne?

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Give us some history of the Green Hill Zone? Why was it started? What
keeps you on the page doing it - basically, What keeps you driving in doing
your webpage daily - in your eyes what makes it special?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Wow, it's hard to pinpoint a particular reason.  It's a myriad of
things.  To me, the GHZ is a learning tool, a way of being heard, a means
through which to express myself, and - in its simplest form - a hobby.  My
favorite thing is watching the site evolve.  As I said, it's very much a
learning tool...no matter how much tweaking I do, I'm stuck in an endless
state of dissatisfaction with the result.  Now as much as ever, I'm
constantly making these "plans" for what big thing to incorporate next, or
how I can make what I've already done even better.  It really is alot of
fun, and I hope to continue the project for many years to come.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>We know of your brothers whom you often talk about, Phat Boy and Spam
^_^ - do they normally help you in any way with the site?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Dude, lay off the crack before lunch.  Spam and PB don't give a flying
flip about the site one way or the other, nor would I trust my precious baby
with their total lack of talent anyway.  My #2 man right now is D-H Master,
a veteran GHZer who has a good writing sense and an unmistakable style.
He's actually done a couple of articles for me in the past.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Your page is respected as being one of the best Sonic game-specific
pages on the net. In your own words - what do you think keeps people
visiting it?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>That's easy...it's the personality!  Content is the most important
thing, of course, but text books have content.  If it's not interesting and
fun, people won't stick around.  I mean, where else but the GHZ can you talk
about the consumption of household cleaners, freely and earnestly discuss
hentai, and compare playing videogames to sex without getting funny stares?
Even more than that, it's the community aspect.  I mean, when we get whole
*fanfics* written about us, you know we're a tightly-knit group.  From EG to
Bo to Moon to WB to Silver and the whole gang...it's just a really friendly,
casual, and entertaining place.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Everyone knows of your affinity for videogames in general. But why
devote your page specifically to Sonic Team? What makes them stand out
above
developers like Capcom, Square, and EA?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>That's easy, too: it's the artistic aspect.  Sonic Team, as I like to
say, is the crossroad where videogames meet art.  Beautifully detailed
worlds, memorable characters, and in-your-face gameplay...only Sonic Team
manages to tie all three together with nary a seam, and they've been doing
it since their first project ever.  I believe it's because there's such an
ideal balance of talent behind the scenes.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you think of the Dreamcast so far? Think it will be seriously
hurt by the launch of PS2? Are you interested in even getting the PS2? Why
or why not?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>I am definitely getting a PS2, there's no question about that.  I've
already got mine reserved.  Will the PS2 launch hurt the DC?  Not long ago,
I'd have said a flat-out "yes."  With the announcement of Sega's "SegaNet"
online strategy, though, the situation has become a bit trickier.  I
honestly don't see the DC as being able to hold up over the longrun in the
face of bad boys like PS2, X-Box, and Dolphin...but I think it should be
able to make the 5-year mark, which is the norm (unless you're Game Boy).
In the end, who really cares about all that?  I've got a Dreamcast and I'm
gonna play Phantasy Star Online and Shenmue!  I'm getting a PS2 and I'm
gonna play Final Fantasy X and Gran Turismo 2000!  Yeah, baby!  Yeaaah!

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How do you think Sega should handle the development of its characters
in non-videogame media?  Do they have an obligation to keep Sonic and the
other characters as close to their game personalities as possible,
or do they need to allow the comic/TV/whatever writers freedom to develop
the characters as they see fit?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Hmm...I think the key word here is "media."  As long as Sega is going to
license their mascot out, it really is impossible to keep tabs on everything
that goes on in his alternate lives.  I don't believe it's Sega's place to
control the content of what goes into non-Sega Sonic media, but at the same
time I don't believe fans should take the Sonic that's depicted in these
alternate worlds as gospel truth.  You know, it's just the marketing game,
and people need to realize that.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What is your honest opinion on the Archie comics? Vile desecration to
Sonic or helpful image that keeps him alive?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Business is business and I've got nothing against Sega sharing the
proverbial wealth, but it should all be taken with a grain of salt.  There
is only one true destiny for Sonic, and that is the one his creators (Sonic
Team) make.  Well, that's my belief system, but as for the Archie comic
specifically...it's utter patootie, which is really why I don't follow it.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you feel about the relationship of the cartoons and DiC
Entertainment in respect to Sonic - ala Sonic SatAM, Adv. of STH, and Sonic
Underground?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Once again, it's the whole "marketing game" argument.  Mixing media is
just asking for trouble, because unless the people involved are hardcore
fans of the property they're working with (and they very, VERY rarely are),
it's all just a matter of what will sell.  It's the same principle that can
be blamed for the fact that all but three movie-licensed videogames ever
made have sucked.  Basically, Sonic is just a marketable character to DiC.
(Of course, he is to Sega as well, which is why there's so much cash-in crap
out there.)

<p><center><img src=images/SegaSonic2.jpg></center>
</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Do you think the non-Sega characters should appear in Sonic
videogames?
If thier not Sonic team then do they even DESERVE a place in the Sonic
genre
of gaming? Why or why not?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Definitely not.  Every different version of Sonic there is sports a
drastically different "feel", and characters from one just wouldn't work in
another.  Well...that's what I'd say if I wanted to sound unbiased, but
frankly, all the other characters just plain suck.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What has been your best, saddest, and most frustrating moment ever in
the production of the Neo Green Hill Zone?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Best moment ever?  I think probably around the time a couple of fanfic
writers came in and wanted to incorporate the GHZ "world" into their
stories.  I think I realized I was really onto something big, then.  Saddest
moment ever...the departure of old friends like EG and Moon who are pursuing
other interests.  It sounds silly, but like I said before, we're really like
a family in there...it's the equivalent of having a close friend move away.
I can't pinpoint a most frustrating moment...all those times I was up at
4:30 A.M. trying to finish a major feature or fix a myriad of broken links.
Nasty stuff, man.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>DRANO !!!! ^_^ You know we had to ask this - why of all things Drano?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Because it's rich, flavorful, and also acts as a laxative!  ...actually,
once during a particularly weird flash of insanity, some one asked me if I'd
been smoking Drano.  I found that gut-busting hilarious for whatever reason
and it stuck.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What is a drano cookie?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>...it is a cookie made of Windex and 409.  Next stupid question!

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>For those who don't know - Who is Midori?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Ah, Midori-chan!  The GHZ's new mascot and poster girl!  When designing
Midori, I had one major theme on my mind: lust.  People have said that she's
a female version of me, but in reality, Midori is my ideal girl.  She was
built on the same "if you can't find her, make her" philosophy that I'm
certain was the driving force behind characters such as Reiko Nagase and
Aeris Gainsborough.  Girls like that just do not *exist* in real life, man.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What things OUTSIDE of Sonic net fandom do you like to do? We know you
have a fascination for Anime - specifically what kinds and why?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>You may be surprised to hear that my favorite type of anime is actually
of the subtle, more mature nature.  I like things that make you think,
like Green Legend Ran and Tenchi Forever.  Those are the sort of stories
that I'd like to write.  And don't tell the fellas, but I like anime with
romantic themes.  (It's pretty funny when I'm walking out Suncoast trying to
hide the Video Girl Ai movie I just bought.)  Oh yeah, hentai is good, too.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>The women Gibbsy - EVERYONE knows you are the official king of NGHZ,
and that no other males on your forum get to talk to the ladies before you
do. Call it protocol. ^___^ So we can let the ladies reading this know
about
the real Green Gibbon - what words do you have for the ladies tonight?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>PARTY AT MY PLACE!  Tonight!  Girls only!  Bring assorted
pain-inflicting devices...

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What are your current favorite videogames and why?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>As of now, I'm in the midst of Dead or Alive 2 and Rayman 2, both of
which kick patootie.  Next to the Virtua Fighter games, DoA is probably my
favorite fighting series.  It inarguably has the hottest chicks, anyway...

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What is the WORST videogame you have ever played? What is the worst
SONIC videogame you have ever played?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>The worst game ever?  Hoo boy...in recent years, when I've made it a
point to avoid bad games, I'd have to say SaGa Frontier.  That is, without
question, the cheapest, dullest, suckiest RPG I've ever played.  And that's
saying alot.  As for the worst game *ever*, I'd say any one of those Mortal
Kombat-esque fighters of the late Genesis era.  One in particular stands
out...I won't specify it, but it's about Robots that Rise...

</font>

<p><center><img src=images/segasonic.gif align=right></center>

<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Do you think that Sega and DiC truly care about the Sonic character
anymore?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>I don't think they ever really cared about Sonic as a character, only
about the money he can bring in.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you think of Sonic Internet fandom in general? Do you believe
that the great Sonic webpages like the Neo Green Hill Zone, TeamArtail, The
Sonic Foundation and Sonic HQ and the numerous mailing lists and newsgroups
help to keep Sonic alive in the fandom or hurt it? Why have you not joined
any of the newsgroups?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Fandom is a funny thing.  If I had to pick one word to describe Sonic
fandom on the 'net, it would be "confusing."  Everyone's got their own idea
of how the Sonic world and characters should be presented, and that's great,
really, but it's all terribly inconsistent.  I suppose this can be said of
any internet fan communities, but still, that's why I've taken a mostly
passive stance on the whole mess.  Rather than sit around and trying to tie
up the loose ends of Sonic's history, I've opted to let sleeping hedgehogs
lie and create a fansite that is simply about the games of Sonic Team.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Robotnik's old look (SatAM) VS Robotnik's new look (Eggman - Sonic
Adventure)? Honestly - what do you think is better? ^_^

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Weeell...the original Eggman is still the best, but of the two you
mentioned then the Adventure model stands out no question.  Unlike the
blobby SatAM version, Adventure's Robotnik retains the "egg" shape nicely.
He's also got Robotnik's trademark long, skinny legs (as opposed to those
disgusting little stumps of the SatAM Robotnik); not to mention the bushy
moustache (as opposed to those orange pencils somebody stuck up SatAM
Robotnik's nose).  Their outfits are equally as ridiculous, but Adventure
Robotnik's seems more...regal.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What has been your most memorable (good and bad) experience with Sonic
fandom both in real life and on the internet?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Hm...I still cite the aforementioned story about my first experience
with Sonic ever as the most memorable.  On the other hand, I'll never forget
the day of the Sonic Adventure press conference (August 22, '98).  My
connection was lagging serious, and I was on literally all day downloading
screenshots that took upwards of fifteen minutes a piece to load.  It was
quite pleasantly suspenseful...

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Are Videogames truly a form of art? What do you have to say to people
that think it isn't?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Don't you dare, and I mean don't even DARE, to question the artistic
aspect of game design in my presence.  Playing a videogame is like walking
into a painting.  There's a world to explore and a story to unravel, and
unlike traditional forms of art, games are much more engaging by actually
putting the player in control.  It's much easier to feel for a character
you've spent a month adventuring with in an RPG than one you've watched on a
movie screen for ninety minutes.  Then there's the mix of media...games can
tell a story, present a world, incorporate fantastic music...not only are
videogames a genuine form of art, they are the absolute pinnacle of
entertainment.  Granted, the industry is still very young and immature, but
it's growing fast and getting better literally every year.  Anyone who
refuses to recognize this is an idiot who foolishly (and quite laughably)
thinks he's sounding intelligent by excercising groundless punditry.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Who are your influences in life?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Everyone I've ever met, really.  I guess I'd cite great entertainers who
use technology as their tools, namely Walt Disney and Shigeru Miyamoto.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What basic advice would you give to a budding young male teenager in
search of the art of hentai? ^____^

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Don't look outside for hentai.  Hentai comes from the soul.  Ponder
that, grasshopper.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What makes doing your webpage fun?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Man, I say this in all honesty: I haven't a clue.  It's hard work, time
consuming, and there's no rewards, but I love doing it anyway.  So your
guess is as good as mine.

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What are your future plans for your career? What do you aspire to do?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Well, that's a given.  I'd like to get into the gaming industry,
ultimately in a producer/director role like the great game designers of
history (Shigeru Miyamoto, Yuji Naka, Yu Suzuki, etc.).  I fancy myself a
storyteller at heart, and videogames are my preferred media for expressing
artistic visions.  (Hey, that sounded good!)

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>If you had the choice to be one videogame character or one anime
character in the world - who would it be and why?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>It's the obvious answer, but I'd say Sonic the Hedgehog.  I like his
"eyes on the horizon" attitude.  His mindset is firmly placed in the future,
which I think is a good philosophy to have because the past can't be changed
but the future can.  And because the future is always ahead of you, it's
literally never too late.  ...or maybe I'd just be Ghaleon (from Lunar),
'cause chicks seem to dig him...

</font>
<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>And finally - What kind of challenge would you like to pursue now? And
what is your greatest achievement with the Neo Green Hill Zone?

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>I've got a couple of cool things planned for the site right now, but
they're still secrets.  (Sore wa himitsu desu!)  As for my greatest
achievement...I'm really proud of the Museum.  That's really the heart of
the GHZ.

<hr width=100%>

<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>For an encore, Gibbs we'd like to ask if you can give a list of favorites
to
wrap this all up. ^_^

<font color=green face=arial size=2><p>Favorite Films: </b>Mary Poppins and Tenchi Forever (aka Tenchi Muyo! in Love 2)!

<p>Favorite Singers And Music: I don't really have any favorite singers...I actually prefer
instrumental music.  I like techno and orchestrated stuff.

<p>Favorite TV: I like old classics like Gilligan's Island and the Dick Van Dyke Show.

<p>Favorite Books: A Journey to the Center of the Earth is, and always will be, the best
novel ever written period.

<p>Favorite Videogames: The Sonic series and the Lunar series.

<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>And lastly your closing statements to the Sonic HQ Staff on thier
anniversary and any Sonic fans reading today: ^_^

</font><p><font color=green face=arial size=2><b>Green Gibbon: </b>Brothers!  The time is at hand!  The era has come for we Sonic-philes to
gather and show the world that we are many!  This is the destiny of our
generation!  We must-  *glances down at the speech he's reading*  Oh...my
bad, wrong generation.  Okay then...PARTY!
