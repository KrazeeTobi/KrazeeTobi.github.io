<a href="mailto:SonicWhamy@aol.com" style=text-decoration:none>Brian Sapinski</a> brings us this interview with <a href="mailto:ROBERTB@lcvax.lehman.cuny.edu" style=text-decoration:none>Robert Brown and Francis Tolbert</a>. For over 3 years, these two men from 
the Bronx have the greatest writing duo in all of Sonic fandom. They 
have continued to amaze us with their incredible stories. Originally, 
their stories gave their opinion of what may have occurred in the 
Saturday morning cartoon if the show had continued into a 3rd season. 
Since the time they began, however, their stories have evolved into a 
universe of their own, one that continues to grow in adventure, 
excitement, and emotion.

<p>*Sonic HQ* How did the two of you first meet?

<p>*Francis*  Well, by accident really.  We went to the same Gym class. 
However, I didn't find out until the end of the semester that I went 
to the wrong class.  I was suppose to go to Gymnastics (which I didn't 
ask for) down the hall.  Instead, I went to Survey (which I did ask 
for) and neither I nor the teacher bothered to look at my program card.


<p>*Sonic HQ* How did you become Sonic fans?

<p>*Robert*  Well, I first became a Sonic fan back in the summer of '91. 
I had graduated from high school, and as my graduation present, I 
asked for a Sega Genesis.  At the time, it came with Altered Beast, 
but you could send away for a new game called Sonic the Hedgehog.  So 
I did, and I tried it out.  Not the best game for me, seeing as I 
mostly play RPG's, but it was new and rather interesting.  At the 
time, I also suscribed to the Sega Visions magazine.  As a bonus, they 
sent me the first issue of the Sonic the Hedgehog comic.  I was 
intrigued, and I loved it.  Then when I heard of the cartoon coming 
out, I woke up early that Saturday morning, and tuned in to one of the 
best cartoon shows I've ever seen.

<p>*Francis*  Me personally, I didn't like the game.  It was all right, 
but it made no sense to me.  But then I heard about this cartoon 
coming out, with Jaleel White, better known as Urkel from "Family 
Matters" as the voice of this hedgehog with an attitude.  I just had 
to see it for myself.  So I watched it and I liked the first episode. 
I watched the next one, and I found myself hooked.  Soon, I was taping 
all of them off the TV so I could watch them whenever I wanted.


<p>*Sonic HQ* In becoming fans of Sonic, has there been a particular video 
game, comic book issue, or cartoon episode that has become your 
favorite?

<p>*Robert*  Well, first things first.  We don't follow the comics, 
especially after what happened in Issue #46....but that's a whole 
other story.  My favorite episode has to be "Doomsday".  If it had 
ended one minute earlier than it did, we'd have nothing to write 
about.  But because of that cliffhanger, it provided part of the 
inspiration that got us to continue on where they left off.  Not to 
mention that intense liplock Sonic and Sally shared at the end.

<p>*Francis*  I have two favorite episodes.  "Sonic and the Secret 
Scrolls" and "The Odd Couple".  I like the first one because I think 
it was the first one where they thought Robotnik bit the dust, and the 
looks on everyone's faces when Sonic flew the plane at the end.  The 
other one was just funny.  I mean, Sonic and Antoine as roommates?  
You knew that was destined for disaster from the beginning.  At least, 
before we got done with them.


<p>*Sonic HQ* As you said, the cliffhanger ending to the cartoon is what 
initially  inspired you two to start writing, since it gave you a 
starting point. Has there been anything else, past or present, that 
has helped to inspire you in writing your stories?

<p>*Robert*  Actually, the cartoon gave us the idea to follow up where it 
left off.  What inspired me to start writing was the story "The Power 
of Love" by Bookshire Draftwood.  The story was very well-written. 
But for the life of me, I could not see Bunnie with Rotor.  So I wrote 
Bookshire, telling him of my idea of Bunnie with Antoine.  He 
encouraged me to put it down in a story and send it in.  I got Francis 
in on it, and well, the rest, as they say, is history.
          But I do want to add one point.  A lot of fans noticed a 
change in our writing starting with "Crystalline Beauty".  I attribute 
that to Dan Drazen's epic, "Mobius Apocalypse".  Since we read that, 
we've aspired to that level of writing, and I think we came closest 
with that story and with "Shadows of Evil".  But hopefully, that will 
all pale with respect to our next story, "ARMAGEDDON".


<p>*Sonic HQ* So now we know how the two of you got started, and what drives 
you. How do you guys come up with your plot ideas for your fanfiction, 
& who is usually the one who comes up with the plots?

<p>*Robert*  For the plots, we usually know where we want the story to 
go, and have for a long while.  We talk over three or four different 
ways to handle it and go with the best.  I tend to come up most of the 
general ideas, but it's about half-and-half for everything inside the 
stories.


<p>*Sonic HQ* You mentioned about your feelings regarding Bunnie's 
relationship. But what about Rotor? While some chose to have him with 
Bunnie, you chose to give him to Dulcy, and even moreso, to turned him 
into a dragon. What was the general basis for this set of decisions?

<p>*Robert*  Well, it wasn't so much that we gave Rotor to Dulcy.  Fact 
is, if you look at the story "Dragon's Heart", you'll see our 
reasoning in it.  Dulcy is a Protector, so she HAS to continue her 
line.  We could've brought in a male dragon, and we did, but not the 
way people thought.  Also, Rotor was starting to fade toward the 
background, especially when Uncle Chuck got deroboticized, thanks to 
Sondra and Tails.  We figured it was the best way not only to bring 
him to the forefront, but to also give him new abilities and 
responsibilities.  Rotor had become a character that we had begun to 
neglect. We didn't want that, so we had to do something.  That's when 
we came up with "Dragon's Heart".


<p>*Sonic HQ* What was the inspiration behind some of your original 
characters?

<p>*Robert*  Well, this is one of the questions we get asked most, so we 
were waiting for it.  Let's start off with Princess Sondra Acorn.  She 
came about for four reasons.  First, I wanted a girlfriend for Tails. 
Second, Sally needed to have another way to keep grounded.  What 
better way than a younger sister?  Third, I always wondered how Sonic 
would act as a female.  That's Sondra in a nutshell.  But finally, and 
probably most important, we needed a way to get King Acorn and Naugus 
out of the Void.  So we made Sondra as a creation of the Void to turn 
against it and ultimately destroy it.  As for her powers, the Void was 
crystalline in every aspect.  It only seemed natural that she herself 
be given crystal powers.

<p>*Francis*  Next, I guess I'll go into the Kavenoff.  When we were 
thinking about "Sonic's Journey", a thought came into my head...Why 
haven't they left the swamp to see if the war had ended yet?  We went 
brainstorming, but nothing could explain why they ('they' meaning 
Sonic's parents) were still away from their son.  So I came up with a 
psychotic and demonic creature called Kavenoff (A sick cross between 
Psycho Sid and Mankind) that took the host of whoever killed it and 
thrived of misery.

<p>*Robert*  My turn.  Tanis Shi-rat.  The inspiration for him comes in 
part from the movie and TV series "Highlander".  In "Highlander", no 
fighting can occur on holy ground.  With the war raging, both sides 
would need a place they could go and relax without having to look over 
their shoulders.  That's when I created Sanctuary.  As for Tanis 
himself, Mobius in this day and age is a world of science and 
technology, much like our own.  But in our past, there was magic.  It 
seemed logical for Mobius to have a similar one.  And no, this does
not mean we think Mobius is a future Earth as is reportedly in the 
comics. Getting back to business, the use of magic, as with Lezar, 
would be very sought after, so there had to be some sort of check. 
That check came when I decided that the Holy Ones were bound by a 
covenant of non-interference.  Thus the covenant of Tanak' Shi-rat was 
born, which also explained the ruling family of Acorn.

<p>*Francis*  Tanis was bound not to interfere.  I wanted someone who 
actively kept the balance.  That's where Donovan came in.  There had 
to be a reason, so I came up with 1. him somewhat being brung up by 
Tanis, and 2. Robotnik holding his parents over head.  When thinking 
about "A Difficult Choice", we needed a way for Bunnie to change her 
limbs back and forth, I came up with the 'Gem of Enchanted Dreams' 
which gave Donovan his wish.  In order for Donovan to know about the 
Gem, I had Robert make up Fiorar, which also explains how Donovan so 
much about computers and fighting.

<p>*Robert*  Which brings me to perhaps our most controversial character, 
Nadia. Nadia started out as just a sassier version of Nicole, much as 
Sondra's a sassier version of Sally.  But once Nadia and Donovan met, 
I knew it was going one of two ways: they were going to hate each 
other, or they were going to love each other.  I wanted the latter. 
But that posed an interesting problem; how could a live squirrel and a 
computer really be in love?  Then came the idea for the "Race of the 
Emeralds".  As soon as we assigned powers to the Emeralds, I knew what 
I wanted to do with the Life Emerald.  And that's when Nadia was truly 
"born" and the rest is history.


<p>*Sonic HQ* When it comes out, do you plan on incorporating any aspects of 
Sonic Adventure into your stories?

<p>*Robert*  In a word, no.  Our stories have always been solely based on 
the original ABC Saturday morning cartoon series.  Yes we bring in 
some facts from the games and the comics (those universally agreed 
upon), but the storylines are only based on what we think would happen 
after Doomsday.  Sonic Adventure is a totally different universe/
timeline.  I don't see any of it showing up in our stories.


<p>*Sonic HQ* Overall, who would you each put down as your favorite 
character, both in and outside of your stories? In other words, who's 
your favorite of those characters we all know, and is there another 
favorite among your  original creations?

<p>*Robert*  I'll answer this question in three parts.  In the "official" 
Sonic universe (i.e. the Sat AM cartoon), my favorite has to be 
Antoine.  Not that there's anything wrong with Sonic, but I saw 
something in Antoine that we brought out in our stories.  No one else 
did until we showed it to them.  The story of my life basically.  As 
for our characters, the nod goes to Tanis.  He has so much power, but 
he has the self-discipline not to use it unless he's supposed to.  And 
to give up your love for your duty....I don't know how many people 
you'd find like that today.  As far as people in other people's 
stories, I'd have to say Sally Alicia Acorn II, granddaughter of Sonic 
and Sally in Dan Drazen's "She Knew the Hand Was Upon Her".  She 
combines all of the best of all the characters in the series.

<p>*Francis*  I'm sorry to say that personally I don't have ready access 
to any of the other Sonic FanFics, so I don't have a favorite in that 
category. From the Sonic cartoon (ABC, Sat. morning...not the other 
crap), my favorite is also Antoine.  He just made me laugh.  As for 
our favorite creation, I have to say the Kavenoff.  He was more evil, 
ruthless, and WAY more psychotic than Robotnik.  


<p>*Sonic HQ* As a final note, I know several people that are trying to 
start their own fanfiction, including myself. Since you two have such 
an  established track record, what advice would you give to aspiring 
fanfic writers (or writers in general)?

<p>*Robert*  We get asked this a lot.  To tell you the truth, the best 
advice we can give is just to get out there and write.  After all, you 
never know what you can come up with and how far it'll take you.  
We're a great example of that, because we had only planned on doing 
about six stories at most.  And here we are, just finished our 28th. 
You get better with practice, and if you show your work to your 
friends, they can help point you in the right direction.
          Thanks for choosing us to be interviewed.  And though 
"Armageddon" has come and gone now, we haven't.  Look for more from us 
in the future.  Till then, like I always say, Happy Reading!

<p>*Francis* And like I say, Peace, see ya later.
