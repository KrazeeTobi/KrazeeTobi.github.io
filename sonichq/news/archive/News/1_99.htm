So how did the Sonic comic sale during the years from 1996 - 1998? This is from Ron's Sonic Mailing List: <a href="archive/Specials/96_98sales.txt" style=text-decoration:none>Sonic Sales</a>. As you can see, Sonic faced a huge drop in sales during the year of 1998. So why is that? You ask. Well, the major reason is not because of Karl Bollors' poor writing, but because of Wal-mart. That's right, Wal-mart. They stopped selling comics, and this really hurt both Sonic and Knuckles' sales. But on a good note, Sonic is gaining momentum in the direct sales market. And with the upcoming Sonic Adventure, Sonic #75 and Sonic Underground, sales should start to rise again.

According to Editor Freddy in Sonic #69, Comic Shop News will start running a Sonic and Knuckles strip for 14 weeks straight starting in May, the stories will be about Sonic and Knuckles waking up in each other's body. Ken Penders says:
<p><i>The Comic Shop News story will not see print anywhere else for at least a year, as that was the deal we
made with them in exchange for printing this story.</i>
<p>The problem is that the Comic Shop News comes in a package with other magazines that cost $10! So is there anyway to just get the story and nothing else? Again, here's what Ken has to say:
<p><i>If 100 people send me $6 US in check or money order (US and Canada orders only) by February 20, I
will order a bundle of each week's installment. I will only send the orders once the fourteen weeks are
released, unless someone is really willing to pay the freight for weekly shipping. I will do foreign orders
only if paid in US Funds and sufficient postage is paid for overseas shipping.
<p>Make the checks or money orders payable to:<br>
C&C Productions

<p>Send to:

<br>Ken Penders<br>
C/o C&C Productions<br>

109 South Ellicott Street<br>

Williamsville, NY 14221

<p>If I receive more than 100 orders, I will order accordingly, but the sooner the orders come in, the sooner
I will know how many to order. If you really want this, don't wait until the last minute to order, send it
now. The reason for this is once i commit to a certain number, that's it. Chances for me to get additonal
copies after February 20 will be next to downright impossible.

Colonel Granite of the UK army has secretly gathered forces and invaded Mobius, while Sonic is trapped with no way to get back to Mobius on Earth (and no, this does not have anything to do with Sonic Adventure).

We first reported some times ago, but Sega PC just released the Sonic And Garfield Pack for Windows 95/98. This game CD will include <i>Sonic and Knuckles Collection</i>, <i>Garfield - Caught in the Act</i>, and <i>Baku Baku</i> - a puzzle game. The CD retails for only $29.99, that's about the same price as Sonic 3D Blast PC. Below is the official press release:
<p><i>SAN FRANCISCO--Jan. 26, 1999--Sega(R) PC today released
                       "Sonic and Garfield Pack(tm)," which brings speedy Sonic the
                       Hedgehog(tm) and GARFIELD, the world's laziest cat,
                       together to strut their stuff on one CD. 

<p>"Sonic and Garfield Pack" includes hit games from "Sonic and
                       Knuckles Collection(tm)," "Garfield -- Caught in the Act(tm)"
                       and a special bonus game -- "Baku Baku(tm)" -- which was
                       named Computer Gaming World Magazine's 1997
                       "Classic/Puzzle Game of the Year."<p> 

                       "Sonic and Garfield Pack" gives gamers a total of more than
                       50 levels of exciting gameplay with well-known characters they
                       love for the low price of $29.99.<p> 

                       More than half of the top selling software products last year
                       were based on well-known characters and properties,
                       according to PC Data. "Sonic and Garfield Pack" is another
                       example of Sega PC's dedication to bringing fun gameplay
                       and beloved character content to the mass market at a
                       competitive price.<p> 

                       "Sonic and Garfield Pack" us comprised of four great games: <p>

                       -- "Sonic the Hedgehog 3(tm)" and "Sonic and Knuckles(tm)"
                       feature all the spin-dashing moves, catchy soundtracks and
                       fast action that made them favorites among gamers of all skill
                       levels. <p>

                       -- "Garfield -- Caught in the Act," shows off GARFIELD's
                       acting abilities in more than 20 zany movie sets. Gamers must
                       help GARFIELD escape from his late-night television
                       nightmare by defeating the evil Glitch, whom GARFIELD
                       himself created when trying to fix his broken TV set. <p>

                       -- "Baku Baku" is an addictive and award-winning column
                       puzzle sensation that pits gamers against the computer or
                       each other to stack up snacks as they fall so all the critters
                       have access to their favorite munchies -- dogs won't chew
                       through bananas to get to bones and rabbits won't gnaw
                       through bones to get to carrots.<p> 

                       "Sonic and Garfield Pack" is available in stores now and
                       operates on Windows 95(R) and 98(R) computers with

The title will probably win hands down in its catagory, since the only other good 3D platformer I see on the game list is Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. The results of the CESA Awards will be revealed after the Tokyo Game Show 99 Spring, which will be in March.

This is about the effects and thoughts on the Sonic Simplenet
crackdown, as said by JD Harding, webmaster of <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://tolwyn.simplenet.com/sonic/" style=text-decoration:none>The Sonic Corner</a>:
<p><i>So far I've found that the following Sonic Simplenet sites, who had
Sonic music on them, are missing:
<p>Sonotropolis (sonotropolis.simplenet.com)<br>
Which had original music by Razor, Arrow, and others.<br>
Foxfire (foxfire.simplenet.com)<br>
Which had all of the Sonic Arcade tracks, and others.<br>
Planet Mobius (mobius.simplenet.com)<br>
Which had an awesome collection of Sonic music.<br>
Sonic Oasis (oasis.simplenet.com)<br>
Which has the whole Sonic Boom soundtrack.<br>
Knuxcom (knuxcom.simplenet.com)<br>
Holding several Sonic mp3s.<br>
<p>Now, as I've looked around, Artail Productions (Team Artail) is the last and FINAL
Sonic website that has Sonic music on it. Sonic R is gone, Sonic Arcade is
gone, Sonic Boom is gone, and the Sonic R Remix music is gone too. If this 
continues and we lose Artail Productions (Team Artail), then we're screwed as far as 
Sonic music goes. I for one am angry that so much Sonic music has 
disappeared from the net. Simplenet has to stop this, as Sega has not 
voiced that their music cannot be distributed on the net. When I hear
that 
Sega themselves, including the composers both agree that the music
CANNOT 
be distributed on the net, then they should take down websites.
Otherwise 
they should keep their paranoid hands off of the Sonic sites, and stick
to 
what they SHOULD be doing, which is upgrading the servers and
maintaining 
their dignity.</i>
<p>JD, as you can see, said some pretty strong words about Simplenet, and 
frankly, I can't agree with him more. We can only imagine what will
happen if Simplenet gets Artail Productions.

<p><i>The latest Sonic Adventure TV ad features our hero declaring his love of adventure

<p>They also said that current Sonic Adventure sales are suppose to rise again as Dreamcast units become more available to the public and the release of Evolution RPG and the upcoming AAA title, Sega Rally 2.

Someone asked me to list all the confirmed/rumored Sonic games for Dreamcast for him. I thought this would be a good time to tell all the fans about them so there wouldn't be any confusion.
<p><i>Sonic Adventure</i><br>
This game is confirmed and out in Japan. The US/European version would be better than the Asian version as SoA and SoE have already put a team to do the translation and fix all the bugs.
<p><i>Sonic R 2</i><br>
This game is unconfirmed but rumored a long time ago. It is very likely, for as of now, Traveler's Tales (the team that made 3D Blast and Sonic R) is very quiet about the games they're making for the Dreamcast.
<p><i>Sonic/Knuckles RPG</i><br>
The game is NOT confirmed. The Sonic Team is thinking of doing it after NiGHTS 2, but Yuji Naka said he wants to do something more original. So if SoJ doesn't make one, a SoE or SoA team such as Sega TI might pick it up. The past confirmation of Sonic RPG turned out to be Sonic Adventure.
<p><i>Sonic Underground</i><br>
Gamer's Republic magazine has said that SoA is planning to make a game based on the cartoon of Sonic Underground coming up this April. I really can't say anything about this because there is nothing to say except that...they're crazy!
<p><i>Sonic the Fighters</i><br>
Another rumored game. Though this is very unlikely, as StF was made for the Titan STV arcade board which was the counterpart for the Sega Saturn. So the game would look really bad graphically on the Dreamcast...
<p>That's all the Sonic games (rumored/confirmed) that I have heard about. Any questions? Just email me from the email above.

This is from <i>Wizard Magazine</i>:
<p><i>Most mainstream comic readers don't follow Archie books. So Sonic the Hedgehog, based on the popular
video game, was left largely to destructive young-uns who've never heard the term 'mylar snug'. Since so
many copies got mutilated, a top-condition Sonic the Hedgehog #1 now runs - you ready for this? - $40 to
$50! Issues #2-#3 run about $15 each, and the rst are easily $1-$2 over cover.</i>
<p>As you can see, the Sonic comic is getting more and more popular by the minute. Oh, and if you're wondering why I didn't put up any comic sales number for so long...it's because I haven't found a comic store that carries Diamond Previews in Memphis yet (I moved, remember?).

Some of the musics from Sonic Adventure that I have heard is remixes
from another Sonic game (I've found two of them so far and both of them
are remixes from the Genesis version of Sonic 3-D Blast!) The musics are
from Twinkle Park (Panic Puppet Zone Act 1)  and the Sky Act Stage (Green Grove Zone Act 1)!
<p>Not all of the musics are remixes however! The Ice Cap and Speed Highway
Zones are some examples of zones having their own original sound tracks!

<p>Some of the Simplenet Sonic sites such as The Sonic Foundation have already taken down their MP3. This is not very good news for Sonic sites. Sonic HQ is currently thinking over if we should start carring the MP3s. But most likely we won't since it's pretty much against the law.

Our WB asked Ken Penders, the writer for Knuckles, how far Sega of America extends its control over the contents in the comics published by Archie. Here's Ken's reply:
<p><i>When I first started working on SONIC, my partner Mike and I would have to write a detailed outline for
Sega to review before we went ahead and wrote a complete script on every story we submitted. While
Karl and I still submit an outline for each issue these days, more often than not it's after the fact and for
Sega's benefit so they have the reader's digest version allowing them to follow along. With some
exceptions, there's little editorial interference, and certainly nothing like the old days. On KNUCKLES, I
have virtually free rein. The last major change I can recall Sega requesting occured during the Lost
Paradise storyline, when they wanted me to eliminate any references to Nazi Germany, no matter how
allegorical they were presented. Fast forward to the current Dark Alliance storyline, chock full of Nazi
references and symbolism.
<p>As for SONIC, because he is the company mascot, that's what Sega pays more attention to, and is more
quickly to pounce on Justin for if they're unhappy with something.</i>
<p>And Ken said "no" when asked "has the Archie crew ever met Bernie Stolar: the head of Sega Of America?"

Next Generation Magazine put up a top 50 games of all time list in their current issue, and guess what? They had Sonic as 42! That's just a bunch of BS. Sonic at least should be in the top 15 if not the top 10. It was a game series that redefined and created platform, adventure, speed, great graphics, great music, and great game control. Let's all hope some other magazine such as <i>Gamers' Republic</i> will make a better list...

Sonic Adventure debuted as the #6 best selling game in Japan. This information is pretty misleading, though. The weekly chart sales was taken from December 21-27.

The fan game, not the official Sonic RPG. But still, if you have played the game, you'll know that it's pretty fun. Mettle, the creator of Sonic RPG, and the Sonic HQ management decided that it is in the interest for both parties that Sonic HQ homes Sonic RPG. A section for the game will go up soon.

Looking at Diamond Previews and preview covers, it looks like that starting with Knuckles #25 and Super Sonic Special #9, the cover price will be raised to $1.79 for Sonic and Knuckles regular issues and $2.29 for super specials.

Three games come to mind, one is Burning Rangers 2, another is a completely original game, and finally, there is Sonic RPG.
