<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

This was bound to happen.  First some of the Sonic site webmasters call this latest Sonic cartoon incarnation terrible, now Ken Penders has gone on record saying it as well:
<p><i>If anyone wants to know where to point blame regarding SU, one need look in the direction of the producers of the series. They're the real villains of this piece. Sega wanted to have a SONIC cartoon on the air, and in order to do that, they either had to go along with the program at DiC or it just wouldn't have happened. Subsequently, lots of decisions were made for all the wrong reasons. I myself know a lot of what really happened, but I can't say yet because of promises made.

<p>There's always the chance some other Sonic cartoon will emerge again, because if there is a demand waiting to be filled, someone will always seek to capitalize on it.

<p>If you like SU, fine. If you don't, that's understandable.</i>

<p>These are pretty strong words, and that combined with all the negative feedback from fans means it's no wonder SU is at an "Off the Air" status in the UK.

<b><font face="arial">The Full Story About SU</font></b> - Vector 1:07 pm CST, 9-2-99</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

The release of SU has been rather confusing, thanks to numerous delays and the fact that it doesn't seem to be showing on the same time and channel in any 2 areas.  I'm hoping to clear things up with this report.

<p>First, SU is not part of a network.  When we say that it's showing on WB or UPN, we mean that it's usually on a local station that is affiliated with one of those networks.  Those stations have more open areas in their schedule than a station affiliated with a larger network.  SU could show up on a Fox station or a fully independent station, but we've heard no reports of this happening so far.

<p>It seems that the long delay in the United States was caused by Sonic Underground's distributor, Bohbot Entertainment.  Bohbot wanted to make SU part of a 2-hour block of programs called BKN2.  BKN1 ("action shows" marketed to older boys) and BKN2 (shows with less action, marketed to girls and younger boys) were supposed to be sold to competing local stations in the same time slot.  Apparently, things haven't worked out exactly as they planned.   Personally, I think this was a stupid idea, because real people's tastes aren't predicted so easily by stereotypes.  Fortunately, it seems that SU is showing up in some places on its own, so Bohbot may be allowing stations to buy shows individually, instead of forcing them to buy the entire block.

<p>As Zifei mentioned earlier, you really have to check your local listings to find the show.  You can find searchable listings at msn.com, go.com, ultimatetv.com, and tvguide.com.  Many (if not most) areas don't seem to be getting SU yet, but that may change in the next month.

Sonic's T.V. Adventures<br>
(a short reveiw straight from the new Offical Dreamcast Magazine)

<p><i>His Hedgehogness spins back onto afternoon T.V.

        <p>Whats super-day-glo green, hopelessy hyperactive, and is the closest
thing you're ever likely to get to an animated likeness of The Cure
front man Robert Smith? That'd be Manic, the newly-born younger brother
of Sonic, who's making his return to the airwavs in a new cartoon
series
called Sonic Underground. Sonic's whacked out sibling isn't the only
new
character addition since The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (also
created by Inspector Gadget animation house Dic) left the air.  In the
new series, Manic, Sonic, and another new arrival, Sonia, have forged a
band (Oh dear_Ed), and now spend their days 'underground' and
undercover
banging out glam rock tunes to cheer up woeful townsfolk who are lorded
over by the evil Sheiff Robotnik.   In short: It's Sonic meets The
partridge Family - so you shouldn't expect it to be a shred like Sonic
Adventure.  Sonic Underground will be airing in more than 182 cities
nationwide when it hits the airwavs on August 29. Check your local
listing for exact airtimes nd stations - just keep the sequined clothes
and gaint wigs stowed well away.</i>
<p>Remember, Sonic Underground starts showing on WB Network tomorrow morning at 6:00am local time.

This is the official word from ReSaurus about the Sonic Adventure toys they're making:
<p><i>Coming this Fall! A new line of 3 3/4" action figures based on the iconic characters from the new
                      Sega Dreamcast video game, Sonic Adventure. The line will consist of Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles
                      "Tails" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each figure will come with an individually sculpted base
                                      and a "floating ring" that will complete the look of the set.

<p>"We're extremely excited about Sonic," says ReSaurus President, Doug Sapp. "Sonic is the mascot of
the new Dreamcast system and the property fits in perfectly with the ReSaurus vision. Taking classic
video game characters and turning them into awesome 3D toys is what ReSaurus does best."</i>
<p>Also, product designer Ken (not Penders) told us that:
<p><i>They will have ball
jointed shoulders, swivel hands, swivel hips, head. Each figure has about seven points, except for Tails who has eight (the tails).
The sculpts turned out pretty cool and production is underway. They are probably going to ship in late October. 
<p>I feel pretty certain that if the Sonic Series One does well then we will do a second series. Of course we
won't know that until the first series hits stores around Thanksgiving. But it should be cool and hopefully people will be stoked
to get them. </i>

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG #79<br>
by Bollers, Fry, & Pepoy<br>
"Sonic Adventure - Part One"<br>
Inspired by the popular "Sonic Adventure" game for the hot Sega "Dreamcast" platform! When Nate Morgan uses his telecrate technology to infiltrate 
Dr. Robotnik's computer network, he receives transmissions that send shivers down the Freedom Fighter's spines: the dastardly Doc has ordered an 
excavation somewhere near the mysterious Cat Country leading them to believe he may have found the Hidden City of the Ancients! Nate and The 
Freedom Fighters are immediately dispatched to quell the threat all, that is, except for Amy Rose, who the others feel is too young. Amy is outraged 
Tails is allowed to go on the mission, and he's the same age as her! Will that stop her? Heck, no! Amy calls upon the powers of the Ring of Acorns to 
make herself older transforming herself into her "Dreamcast" counterpart, and depleting the ring of all its energy in the process! The price is a harsh 
one, as the ring has been used in the service of healing the Queen. Fearing ill effects, Nate insists Amy comes along on the mission with them. Can they 
survive Amy's amazing transformation? For that matter, can Amy?! It’s a journey of discovery that will lead our fearless heroes to the startling new 
world depicted in the Sonic Adventure Dreamcast game! PLUS: The senses-shattering conclusion to the epic "Tales of the Great War" back-up series by 
Ken Penders, Chris Allan, and Jim Amash.<br>

It was inevitable, but now, Babbages and Software Etc. has now officially stopped taking pre-orders.  Now, people wanting a Dreamcast will have to wait for the second or third shipment of consoles from Sega. <p>Why is this happening?  Because the company (Babbages and Software Etc. are one in the same) don't want to bog down Sega with more orders, especially since they think it's going to be tough to get the 350,000 projected consoles pre-ordered out on time.  Notice how this number is far higher that Sega's announcement of 200,000 pre-orders. <p>Does this mean stores like EB may do this too?  Absolutely.  In fact, EB may have to in order to 'guarantee' everyone who pre-ordered a console to have theirs on the 9th. <p>What should you do now?  As of this point, your best bet is to go to stores like CompUSA, Best Buy, and other large chain retailers, as they can probably get you a console on the 9th. More info as we get it.

Way back in the Spring of 1999, we did a <a href="
archive/Specials/Fleetwayspecial.htm">special</a> about the Fleetway Comic management. How it's messing up the comic. Lew Stringer, one of the main writers wrote us a letter. Sort of a view from the other perspective:

<p><i>Good to see your Sonic page; well designed and enthusiastic, but spoilt

by

the feature on Fleetway's Sonic. Your so-called "reliable" source

couldn't

be further off the mark if he/she tried. I'm sorry you don't like my

stories, and you're entitled to your comments of course, but your

writer's

attitude to Debbie Tate was undeserved.  

<p>Here's the true relaible facts; none of the cost-cutting measures taken

on

the comic (axing of editorial/letters; reprints; less pages, etc) were

Debbie's choice. Decisions like that are made by the Marketing Manager

and

Publisher.  The Editor would prefer them not to happen. No doubt about

that.

But the decision is out of her hands, with no room for discussion,

believe

me.

<p>Similarly, the decision to replace other Sega strips with all-Sonic

related

stories was made by senior management and Sega itself. However, in that

instance, the decision was welcomed by the majority of readers, who had

often requested more Sonic-related stories in the comic.

<p>The attitude of your feature writer is ill-informed, bitter, and very

immature. I know you took his/her word on trust, but it is inaccurate

in the

extreme. I can guess who (FW) might be, and I suspect he has his own

axe to

grind, but hate-mongering the wrong person isn't very noble.

<p>I hope you don't mind me sending in this response. I don't wish you

guys any

ill will but I just felt that needed clearing up. </i>

<p>We'll glad to see that some official people actually visit our page from time to time. And we'll let you decide on what to believe on this issue.

<img src="../news/images/archive/CHUCK.gif" align=left> Okay, if anyone saw Sonic Super Special #10 with the Sonic Underground

story, 

it was said that Sonic lived with his Uncle Chuck before he met Sonia

and 

Manic. Though some though this was something Achie threw into the SU 

storyline, the story behind Uncle Chuck is, indeed, true. SU Episode

#38 

"Back to the Beginning Again" features the story behind Sonic

Underground's 

beginning...and Uncle Chucks appearence. Although the english episode

is not 

yet released in UK, there is a copy of the french version of the

episode <a href="http://dream-avenue.simplenet.com">here</a>..

Sunday, 15th August, 8:56am GMT - just a few minutes after "Friend or

an extra-special episode of Sonic Underground finished airing.

<p>Why extra-special? Perhaps because for the first time ever, Knuckles
has
appeared in a Sonic cartoon, and it wasn't that bad either. His voice
was a
little higher in tone than I would've expected, perhaps due to the fact
that
the voice artist is the same one who does Cyrus ("Tangled Webs", "Come
Out

<p>Interestingly, the ending (which I won't spoil) does give the
possibility
that Knuckles may appear in future episodes. Time will tell...

I was thumbing through the new issue of Wizard: The Comics Magazine

which I got yesterday, and came across this article on SA:<P>
<I>The Hedgehog Is Back!<P>
Sonic Adventure updates Sega's hyper-kinetic star and throws him into a

series of three-dimensional worlds that fly by at fantastic speeds-the

Dreamcast graphics must be seen to be believed! There are six

characters

to chose from this time around: Supersonic the Hedgehog, Tails the Fox,

Amy Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna (an anteater), Big the Cat, E102r, a

C3PO-like robot. Most of the gameplay is based around Station Square, a

geographic hub where Sonic can interact with other characters, solve

puzzles and find hidden level entrances to begin each stage. Once

you're

on a stage, you maneuver along gravity defying tracks, collecting rings

and rocketing off launch pads that propel Sonic at super-speeds.<P>
In addition to the normal gameplay, Sonic Adventure features

puzzle-like

subgames, including pinball and skiing segments. The most interesting

subgame is a Pokemon-esque pet-hatching simulation that takes place in

Chaos Gardens. By carefully placing Chaos eggs found in other levels,

Sonic can incubate and hatch baby Chaos monsters.<P>
The basic gameplay of Sonic Adventure is essentially the same as

earlier

installments in Sega's classic series-Sonic still does his signature

spins, jumps and super-dashes. Part nostalgia trip and part fast-paced

adventure, Sonic Adventure is sure to be a smooth, challenging

game.</I><P>
And no, the "Supersonic the Hedgehog" and "Amy Hedgehog" things were

not

typos on my part. Neither was anything else.<P>
In the sidebox under the two pictures (one of Sonic in a blue blur. I

think he's either spinning or screeching to a halt. And one of

Knuckles)

it says:<I> SONIC BOOM Yep, the world's fastest (and bluest) hedgehog

is

back in what looks to be his most harried adventure yet.</I><P>
And in the "Try It" box it said:<I> Remember all those Sonic The

Hedgehog games from a couple of years ago? Wanna relive some of that

magic? Pick up Sonic Adventure!</I>

The <a href="http://www.canadawired.com/~gvink/Sega/">DC Tech Pages</a> Message Board has a ton of reaction to this big turn of events.  Here are a select few:
<p>From 'nickt':<p><i>I just don't get it!! Regaedless of what Mr. Stolar did to deserve this, what is with the timing of this drastic measure. Why would any intelligent company fire their COO, one month before the biggest launch in entertainment history - is this supposed to garner loyalty, and trust in the Sega Brand Name...The timing of this announcement couldn't be worse if there was a 3 year old running the company. If there where differences between Mr. Stolar and Japan they surely could have waited until after the launch!!</i><p>From Solid Snake:<p><i>I admit, that a little part of me has lost respect for Sega in general. When will SOJ learn. Nintendo of Japan couldn't run the North American market, so why does SOJ think they can. This is totally crazy! I just got a little less excited about the DC launch. Man, I almost want to stop buying import games to show my anger. Probably won't do that, but I have lost alot of respect at least for SOJ. Grow up Sega!</i><p>From Sega2000:<p><i>Here's the quote he 




</i>(Stolar)<i> said about SOJ... 
<p>"Dreamcast to date has been a failure in Japan. I'm not going to lie about that. The price drop has helped; now they need the software. You know what? I'm proud and glad that an American is saving the company, and that's ironic, because Sega was started by four Americans." 

<p>Is that enough to get the president of SOA fired? I've lost a lot of respect for Sega today.</i><p>From a very angry Sonikka:<p><i>My DC buzz is dead! Firing a guy for doing everything right is pathetic, and is one of the reasons I disrespect SONY. Now Sega does the same thing that Sony pulled in 95 and just because I'm a diehard SEGA fan I should accept it? I think not. 
<p>Bernie took the heat for killing Saturn and then rebuilt SoA into a legitimate company and this is how you repay him? SEGA, I am repaying you by not buying a DC on 9-9-99. Will I buy a DC? I don't know, but I won't be getting one anytime soon. I'll just stick to the import DC I have and play only 3rd party games.SEGA you have done the impossible. YOU HAVE KILLED MY DC BUZZ!...I thought you learned with the Saturn that you can't run the American market from Tokyo. I hate to say this, but I think the old SEGA is back!</i><p>These are some very harsh words, and there are many more of these reactions right now, and definitely much more to come.  Realize that details are still sketchy as some questions have yet to be answered. More as we get it.

 3:40 PM CST: This is <i>the</i> <a href="http://www.sega.com/corporate/press_releases/99aug/press_att.html">official word</a> from Sega's <a href="http://www.sega.com">web site</a>.
<p><b>EARLY TODAY</b>: Here's the plan courtesy <a href="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid">Next Generation</a>: <p><i>As an incentive to use Sega’s preferred provider, gamers signing up with AT&T WorldNet service for use with the console will receive a free Dreamcast keyboard. 

Unfortunately, online gaming will not be provided on the Sega Dreamcast Network from the outset. "We’re not announcing any dates regarding online gaming at this time," said Stolar. "Full online gaming will be available next year. Sega is committed to providing triple A titles to its customers, games that push the envelope."
<p>How much will using AT&T through your Dreamcast cost you? AT&T will keep its standard pricing policy for the service. The cost weighs in at $19.95 for 150 hours of access, or an unlimited access price plan for $21.95. 
<p>All functions available on the Japanese equivalent will be there in the US. From day one, downloads for the VMU will be available for Sonic the Hedgehog. Email and chat rooms will also be up and running from the word go. 

</i><p>Now, continuing coverage from <a href="http://www.excite.com/">Excite</a> and Reuters:<p><i>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sega of America, a U.S. unit of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd., Wednesday said the videogame equipment maker picked telephone giant AT&T Corp. to provide Internet access for its new Dreamcast game console.

The highly anticipated Dreamcast, to be launched next month, will be the first gaming console capable of logging on to the Internet, with a 56 kilobit modem and a price of $199.
<p>In a conference call, Sega said Dreamcast customers could sign up to AT&T's WorldNet Internet service under several plans, including a standard plan of 150 hours a month for a monthly fee of $19.95, or unlimited access for $21.95.
<p>Sega said the first Dreamcast game, Sonic Adventure, would have online components. It added that full online gaming -- in which players compete against each other on the Internet -- would not be available until sometime next year.
<p>Monday, Sega said it had taken more than 200,000 pre-orders for Dreamcast, which it hopes will propel it ahead of rival console makers Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Sony Corp.
<p>In addition to Internet access, Dreamcast will be the first console fitted with a 128-bit processor for speedy graphics display. Sega is promoting the machine in the United States with a $100 million marketing campaign.</i><p>Thanks to <a href="mailto:wacko@emulationzone.org"> Andy Wolan</a> for tipping Sonic HQ News on the excite story.

<b><font face="arial">No DC in Australia until October! </font></b> - Tristan 5:53pm CST, 8-3-99</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

 Guess what Australian Sega fans, you don't get your DCs for at least another two months! Here's an official statement from Steve O' Leary of Sega Ozisoft courtesy <a href="http://www.segaweb.com">Segaweb</a>: <p><i>Let me just post an official reply to the delay rumours for Dreamcast. The Dreamcast will now go on sale in October 1999. The reasons for this action are quite simple and are as follows. 
<p>1. Customising the browser disc for use in Australia has taken longer than expected. 
<p>Sega is in an incredibly unique situation where they are launching the first on-line console that will offer the user full Internet access, including web browsing, sending and receiving email and on-line gaming. This takes a great deal more effort and planning than just launching a standard console, including liaising with an Internet service provider, developing a 'plug and play' operating system and setting up a huge network that can cater for over 200,000 users in the first year. The unique situation for Sega also extends to the fact that they are launching the console in the US and Europe in the same month, and that even with this incredible workload Sega are currently working 24/7 to ensure that the launch of the Dreamcast is an absolute success in both territories. 
<p>Australia and New Zeland are also in a unique situation where their telecommunications system is different from the UK, Europe and Japan, so additional modifications have to be made to the browser disc to ensure that the console is fully Internet compatible day 1. Dreamcast is currently facing the largest launch ever for a games console, with over 2.4 million consoles pre-ordered in the US alone. Demands like this obviously place a strain on the company as a whole, but as I mentioned, they are doing their best to ensure that the Dreamcast is a success in all territories. With they systems current specs, Internet abilities and large range of launch titles, its a safe bet to day that they will achieve this goal. 
<p>With these factors in mind, OziSoft have decide to delay the console's launch until October'99 so that the console will be fully Internet compatible at launch with a 'plug and play' browser disc that allows even the most computer illiterate user to browse the web with ease. Our decision was further strengthened by the fact that Sega Europe had decided to only have around 5 games at launch and had adopted a strategy where they would release games every week rather than all at once. 
<p>While we don't disagree with this strategy, the option of delaying the console a month because of the browser disc modifications will ensure that the console has 10 games day 1, as well as games being released every week until Christmas. 
<p>Please understand that OziSoft are completely dedicated to the Dreamcast becoming the success in Australia and New Zealand that it will be in the rest of the world. 
<p>We have the best technology, and most importantly the best games. Be rest assured that OziSoft has the best marketing team on-board who will do justice to the great system that Sega have created for you, the gamer. 
<p>If you have any personal comments, or suggestions, please mail them to me directly or post them on this board. 
<p>As a part of the Dreamcast team, I can assure you that we are all to eager to listen to your concerns and what you have to say.</i>
