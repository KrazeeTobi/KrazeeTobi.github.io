This is it, a Sega commercial IS in the movie Big Daddy that started showing yesterday. It's about 1 min long. And Sonic IS in it. Guess what fans? Sonic is on the big screen! And he looks darn good. I'm suspecting the trailer will be on the net soon, so stayed tuned! Now, as for the trailer in Star Wars, I don't know, it said so in the Sega press release.

Recently, Ken Penders told the comic new media about Super Sonic Special #11:
<p><i>Sonic Super Special #11 ships on Oct. 1 from Archie Comics. The
                  "all-female" issue is written by Ken Penders. 

                  <p>"After hearing way too many people say Sonic and Knuckles comics
                  are aimed strictly at boys, it occurred to me that here was a chance to
                  acknowledge our female readership, and so I concocted a theme issue
                  aimed squarely at placing the female cast members front and center,"
                  Penders told The Continuum. 

                  <p>"I picked five of the readers' favorite characters for the spotlight, and
                  to make the Special really special, so to speak, I'd feature all five in solo
                  stories where something pivotal happens to each of the main characters.
                  Every story has an effect, a direct consequence, upon the main
                  continuity in each series that simply can't be ignored, and will be
                  expanded upon in future issues. 

                  <p>"Having written all five stories, it also occurred to me that it might be a kick having each story
                  pencilled by someone different, while I had the fun of inking every one, so I rounded up a list of
                  suspects, which included Jim Valentino, James Fry, Colleen Doran and Sonic cover artist Pat
                  Spaziante. I saved the fifth story for myself, as that featured a character I created." </i>

Remember a few weeks ago, we first reported about the Star Wars/Knuckles crossover coming up by Manny Galan? And we said we weren't sure if it will happen because of the recent Knuckles sales. Ken Pendered commented on this:
<p><I>Manny must have spilled the beans to someone about a 2-part Knuckles story he wrote featuring a
Star Wars like setting with characters. He has yet to set pencil to paper in regards to drawing it, and
at this point, it's uncertain when, or if , it'll see the light of day.</i>

<b><font face="arial">Bi-monthly Knuckles...</font></b> - Zifei 12:43pm CST, 6-25-99</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

Knuckles will go bi-monthly starting around K#35 due to poor sales. Here's what Ken has to say regarding this matter:
<p><i>After KNUCKLES #34, Knuckles will become a bi-monthly series (more than likely) as opposed to
even 9 times a year (still under consideration). What would have been KNUCKLES #35 will now be
SONIC #82, just so readers won't have to wait an extra month for the conclusion to the SONIC
ADVENTURE game adaptation.
<p>Before anyone makes a claim if we had done this or that, things would be different, let me relate
some FACTS, as these are indesputable:

<p>FACT ONE: SONIC continues to outsell KNUCKLES, by a more than comfortable margin.
KNUCKLES is clearly on the bubbble. However, the latest sales results are from issue #22, so any
efforts fandom is doing to save this book as far as sales go won't be know for at least another four or
five months at least.

<p>FACT TWO: Changing artists had no effect whatsoever in either the decision making process or on
sales. KNUCKLES sales begin declining during a popular storyline while Manny was still regular
artist. (The reasons for declining sales can probably -- and more like are -- due to poor distribution,
but a poor name recognition in the marketplace is also being attributed. Sonic fandom very well
knows who Knuckles is, but the general audience does not.)

<p>FACT THREE: Despite all the complaints over how lousy things supposedly are with the SONIC
series and all the accolades over how well-done (for the most part) KNUCKLES is, sales do not
support the contention that fans are unahppy with SONIC and happy with KNUCKLES. Again, one
can argue quality until one is blue in the face, but the fact is a book sells for reasons beyond whether
it's good or not. For example, there are several years worth of various Marvel and DC titles of some of
the most popular characters -- Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men to name but a
few - where the content has been totally substandard, especially in comparison to the good stuff, yet
people still kept buying them. Why? Brand name has something to do with it. Sonic is a recognizable
brand name. Knuckles, in all honesty, is not.

<p>So what does this mean? 

<p>It means that unless more people support this book, it's gonna go bye-bye. 

<p>What can you do?

<p>What I've recommended before, tell friends, and even write the publisher Michael Silberkleit and tell
him how much you enjoy reading the series. 

<p>It's now or never, and only you guys can do it. Please spread the word. </i>
<p>Well, we can only hope that in a few month, sale figures will pick up.

Yeah, I know, Sonic Adventure hasn't even reached this side of the Pacific yet, and they're already talking number 2? Well according to MoFo's Rumor Report at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990828023309/http://www.gaming-age.com">Gaming-Age</a>, they are:
<p><i>Along with Nights 2, Sonic Adventure 2 is a title that Sonic Team is working on. The Team
    came to the States to rework the first Sonic game and actually started the conceptual work for
    the sequel! No news on a release date yet. A source close to a few Sonic Team members told
    me that this just maybe the first DVD game for the Dreamcast. </i>
<p>Well...this is only a rumor, but a very reliable one, since most of the stuff from Mofo has turned out to be fact. As for the DVD, Sega will somehow get a DVD upgrade out in 2000 or 2001 for a very cheap price. Don't know how they'll do that, they're not talking.

There are so many Sonic fans out there that wants to work on the Archie Sonic comics. Well, is there a chance for them? Not much according to Ken Penders:
<p><i>At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, there's just no way anyone else is going to get in at Archie to work on Sonic and/or Knuckles. First off, Justin already has a number of freelance professionals, including myself, who work on the books regularly. Then he has a established professionals he can call on if he needs to for other things beyond what was planned. Finally, he already has the next year's worth of material already under development, which we're already fighting tooth and nail to see that gets published.</i>

Ken Penders again confirmed that <i>the</i> Robotnik we used to know is dead. Here's what he said:
<p><i>Sure thing.  Robotnik IS dead.  Yet we're promoting the return of
Robotnik.  
How can this be?  Without giving away any surprises, we had this
planned for 
quite some time.  Sega gave us permission to kill off Robotnik as long
as
we brought him back some time later.  They were figuring on six months
later.
We were already figuring out how to fight a guerilla war to keep him
out of 
action longer than that.  The major reason we did so is that we never
felt
that particular version was believable as Sonic's ultimate villain.  We
wanted 
something closer in concept to the games and the anime, something that
would 
really make the Sonic fans go wild.  Personally, I like what Karl has
done, 
but the ultimate jury has yet to be heard from.</i>
<p>Gee...I wonder what that meant...

<font size=-1 face="arial">

Sega will start their TV marketing in August, here's what Peter Moore, senior vice-president of marketing at SoA has to say:
<p><i>We will be doing six TV commercials that will be
             filmed exclusively on Dreamcast hardware. No company has ever had the confidence to do
             that before with the quality of its product. It is generally the usual, here is some live action
             footage, cut to game play and back out to live action footage. Nobody has been able to put
             together commercials like ours before. We have signed an exclusive contract with PDI, who
             did Antz. The Antz team is working on the campaign. It will debut in August and it will blow
             people away. </i>
<p>I'm pretty sure, as should everyone, that one of the commercials is a cgi Sonic commercial, since Mr. Moore goes on to say that Sonic Adventure is a big part of the marketing.

Not exactly Sonic news, but Ken Penders news...
<i><p>Finally, FINALLY, I have rock-solid information, having nailed down the all-important printer and distributor problems just to get the thing launched.
<p>Here's the straight scoop:
<p>THE LOST ONES #1 will be solicited in the August issue of Diamond Previews, and will be officially released in early October under my Aero Comics imprint. It will be 32-pages, full color and retail for $2.95. (As much as I wanted to, I simply don't have the resources of Archie, DC or Marvel to allow me to release at a lower cover price. I made up for it, however, in a number of ways as you will see.)
<p>The stories will run 28 pages in length, with a letters page and a fan art page as part of the package. Depending on what I have to work with, either could run more than one page in length.
<p>For those of you who don't have access to a comic book shop, subscriptions will be available. No set price yet, but the books will come sealed in a bag with a backing board, along with an autograph. The first 100 subscribers will also receive a special surprise. Details will be available on THE LOST ONES website when it goes online later this month.</i>
