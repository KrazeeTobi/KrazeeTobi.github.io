<p>"Don't Call It A Comeback." The intrigue continues as Sonic and the Freedom Fighters return to Knothole Village to
find only his parents there. Where did everyone else go? Fed up, Sonic and his pals take off for outer space in
search of answers ­and the culprit behind their friends' disappearance. But once they find out who the
village-napper is, they might wish they'd never asked.</i>
<p>Start guessing...is it Robotnik? Or is it Robo-Robotnik? Or is it someone else? The truth is out there...

continues as a mind-cntrolled Sonic has invaded Westbridge to do Enchantra's bidding. Will he snap out of it, or
will Sabrian have to use every trick in her magical arsenal to stop the onslaught? As if things couldn't get any
worse, Enchantra left the portal to Sonic's home planet, Mobius open ­ who knows what diabolical super-villains
may follow Sonic into Sabrina's world? "Zone Wars: A Tale Of Two Hedgehogs." Featuring the cast of Sonic
Underground. You're not seeing double ­ you're just seeing a crossover between the Sonic that's everyone's come
to grow and love and the Sonic who's starring in the new Sonic animated TV series this fall. And that's the only
Sonic on view. It all starts when Sonic goes zone-hopping in pursuit of Evil Sonic, who's been impersonating Sonic
to retrieve Giant Borg components for a fiendish plot. Along the way, he lands smack-dab in the middle of Sonic
Underground's world ­ where Sonic, his sister Sonia and his brother Manic are rock stars. This alternate Sonic and
his friends are swept into the adventure, and even run up against a Robotnik from their world. Can the blue blur
save his guitar-slinging double? Will a new hero be born this day? </i>
<p>From this spoiler, we learn two things:<br>
1) Sonic Underground is coming this fall or around that time table instead of mid-April as we have hoped.<br>
2) Archie would want to use this issue to see it they have enough support to extend a Sonic Underground series (which I don't think they do guessing from fan reactions on the net).

Paul Castiglia, the first writer, supporter of the Sonic comic, and the current Promotional Director at Archie, is going to leave Archie Comics to pursue a better job. Here's what he said:
<p><i>Greetings, all.  Paul Castiglia here.  I apologize for the form letter,
however,
since I've made many friends and acquaintances here online, I thought
it might
be the best way to spread the news of my imminent departure from Archie
Comics.
Since January, 1990, I've been on staff at Archie, wearing several hats 
including Manager Of Direct Sales, Promotional Director, Archivist, New
Product
Development, occasional Editor and Archie Website content provider.  I
also 
did some freelance writing for them from time to time.  I'm leaving to
pursue 
a career at Arcotoys, which is a division of Mattel based in New York.
<p>I will be a copywriter-- strike that-- THE copywriter for all their
packaging,
catalog, website, ads, etc. (with occasional copy farmed out to
freelancers
when the workload is overloaded).  The benefits are tremendous, and
I'll also 
have the opportunity to submit and develop new product ideas, which is
an 
opportunity only open to Mattel employees.  So I'm excited.  At the
same time,
I'm a little melancholy because I've spent a great deal of time at
Archie, 
learned so much and met so many people.  But I do not intend to leave
comics 
behind entirely.  Archie has assured me I can continue to write stories
for 
them on a freelance basis and I've also contacted a few other editors
at other 
publishers.  So perhaps my name will continue to appear in Archie
publications
in the future.  My last day at Archie will be Friday, April 9th.</i>
<p>No word yet on who will replace him.

In Knuckles #24's Q&As, Sonic Editor Justin Freddy said that Elias was five years old when he crashed on the Floating Island, but he didn't <i>look</i> five in the comic...Ken Penders explains:
<p><i>Here's the straight scoop. When working on THE FORBIDDEN ARC storyline, it was always my intent that Elias was older
then Sally, even if they were twins and it was a matter of him emerging first. Upon discussing the Sally's brother when the
storyline was first proposed, Justin automatically decided Elias was older, but at that point not sure by how much. (He also
asked me if I had a name, and if not, since Karl would be handling the character much more than I he asked if Karl could
contribute suggestions. Since I hadn't any specific name in mind, it was Karl who came up with Elias, which we all liked.)
<p>During the production of KNUCKLES #19 through 21, Manny had decided he could no longer handle full-length stories on a
regular basis because of his job at Nickelodeon, so some things got overlooked while we were revamping everything in order
to keep the production schedule on track. One of those things was that Elias should have been depicted as a toddler instead of
an infant when he left the Floating Island.
<p>Regarding the letters page in question, Justin now admits he goofed in saying Elias was five when he should have said he was two or three at most.</i>

Paul Castiglia, manager of sales and promotion, replied to the harsh critiques about the Sonic Super Specials:
<p><i>I'm writing concerning Sonic crossovers in general, and the
Sonic/Sabrina
crossover in particular.  Here's the deal from where we sit at Archie:
the
48-page specials serve a function.  They allow us a venue wherein we
can do
the stories Sega wants us to do which have specific appeal to younger
fans.
This includes crossovers.  Simply put, you should consider these
stories 
like the DC Comics "Elseworlds" stories.  In other words, they are
primarily 
"What If?" stories that should not affect the regular continuity of the 
Sonic universe as portrayed in the monthly Sonic comic books.  

<p>We feel this
effectively allows us to do stories that ARE continuity-based in the
monthly
Sonic comic.  You might say the 48-page specials are a "necessary evil"
that
allow the monthly Sonic comic series to exist as its own entity, with
its own
continuity, and where more serious subject matter can be brought up
from time
to time.  The bottom line: No [one] HAS to buy the 48-page specials--
no one 
is forcing you.  You do so at your own will.  If you think they're too
babyish,
simply save your money and just buy the monthly Sonic series.  Leave the
48-page specials to the many kids who buy, read and enjoy them.  Hope
this
makes sense to everyone...</i>
<p>Wait a min, I thought that the Sonic/Sabrina crossover was <i>suppose</i> to effect the regular series...

Well, it's official, one of the top five Sonic sites is heading down the drain come April 2, 1999. Here's the words from SharpKnux himself, head of <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011217000000/http://knuxcom.simplenet.com/">KnuxCom</a>:
<p><i>I have decided that as of April 2, 1999, I will close down all of KnuxCom.  As of currently, the only page that resides on KnuxCom is the Sonic Page.  So by April 2, that page will be gone.  Why am I doing this?  Well, for a simple two reasons: I lost interest in doing a general Sonic site, and there are plenty of Sonic sites out there that are much better than mine (and I figure, it's too late to "win" back fans of the site).  I was going to create a page called The Sonic Database, but those plans have been cancelled.  Sorry. 
<p>So what's going to be here instead?  Well as of April 2, 1999, I plan on changing KnuxCom into SharpKnux's Art Studio, which is simply going to be an art site featuring my artwork (and perhaps a fan art archive).  I have been wanting to make a site like this for a long time, but simply haven't had the time to do so while trying to complete KnuxCom's other pages.  I figure I will have more interest in my site if my site revolves around my favorite hobby: art.  I will put up more info on the new site when the time comes. 
<p>I will keep the Sonic Page link open from here until April 2, which is when I will delete the enitre page.  Take what you want from the site, but remember to give me credit for what is mine in there, and do not copy anything word for word either.  Anyone hear of plagerism?  It's illegal...  Oh yes, one more thing.  Please do not flame me or send me nasty complaints about my decision. It's final, and I'm the one paying for the account.  =) 
<p>I would like to thank everyone who supported KnuxCom in the past two years.  This would be everyone who has linked to this site (and I encourage you to keep linking ^_^), anyone who has submitted anything to my site, and any one who just comes by and visits.  Thanks again, and, as I always say when I put messages to a close: Later! </i>
<p>Well, it was good while it lasted, ever since 1996. Hopefully, another site will rise up and take its place.

they see 
it and say that the characters aren't on model to the now

<p>Hmm..."character aren't on model" compared to the SatAM? Personally, I would even consider Spaz's art off model compared to the SatAM. So I wouldn't worry too much about that, considering James Fry did an excellent job in SSS#8.

<p>Please note that these are all rumors right now, and according to a conference call (If you wish to hear the conference replay yourself dial 1-800-685-9482. Passcode 1999) made by SoA's president/CEO Bernie Stolar today, Sega will still aim for Fall, 1999 launch; Sega will begin full marketing in mid-April (that's not far away); and there would be 10-12 launch games.

Keb Penders today gave out some hint about a special Sonic project coming up:
<p><i>If you want proof of how I really feel about SONIC himself, wait'll you the special that Spaz and I are working on. It's so
special, it's gonna rock Sonic fandom for a loop when they see it. But don't take my word for it. You'll have to wait until it
comes out, which won't be until the end of the year most likely. More than that I can't say, as all of us at Archie signed a blood
oath on this one.</i>
<p>Nice to know that Spaz would finally be drawing another special. Wonder what this could be.

Here's a couple of things Ray have learned from Ken Penders:
<p><i>1) Nack was a member of the Chaotix team a long time ago.</i>
<p>How and why did he quit we don't know. But this is sounding very much like the Fleetway version.
<p><i>2) Mighty has changed A LOT since the past few issues. He has adapted to be more of a "tough" guy than he originally was.</i>
<p>Could Ken already be trying to create the environment for the the introduction of Ray into the Chaotix?

If you still haven't seen this yet (it was on the net since about 3 days ago), here's the artist list again for the upcoming Female Furries Super Special set for SSS#11 from Ken Penders:
<p><i>The PRINCESS SALLY story "ASSENSION" is pencilled by Jim Valentino.
<p>The BUNNIE RAB-BOT story "UPGRADE" is pencilled by James Fry.
<p>The JULIE-SU story "SHADOWS" is pencilled by Pat Spaziante.
<p>The HERSHEY story "COMMANDO" is pencilled by Yours Truly.
<p>And if I may introduce the first female penciller to the Sonic art team line-up, Colleen Doran will be pencilling the LUPE story
"FAMILY", which ties up all the events from SONIC #67 through 69.</i>
<p>Let's all hope Colleen Doran can get in, because she's a pretty well known and good artist.
