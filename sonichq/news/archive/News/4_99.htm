I was reading the latest issue of the gaming magazine "Tips & Tricks"
when I saw that Walt Disney Enterprises had signed with Sega to produce
a few games. Why is this so interesting? Because Disney is the operator
of the television network ABC, the same network that had aired the
Sonic SatAM from Sept '93 to July '95.
<p>Actually, Sega and Disney had great ties ever since the Genesis days. But I would be surprised if ABC ever run Sonic Underground.

Acording to <a href="http://www.videogames.com">Videogames.com</a>, Sega has divided the Sonic Team into three parts:
<p><i>Our sources in Japan spoke with a former Sega
                employee who told us that the Sonic Team has
                been divided into three parts (Naka team, Iizuka
                team, and Oshima team), as some employees
                were not happy working with Yuji Naka. The Iizuka
                team is in the states working on the US version of
                Sonic Adventure; the Oshima team is working on
                a new project (possibly featuring a brand new
                character); and the Naka team is working on
                NiGHTS 2. </i>
<p>This came off as Sega was hit by the ending of a bad financial year. And this move is a VERY good move. The old Sonic Team could never make 3 different games at the same time as the Sega AM divisions could. Now it's possible.

Ken just told us to not to put up the Comic Shop News Sonic comic because:
<p><i>I hate to say it, but it's NOT okay to run the CSN Sonic story for
several 
reasons.  One: you're infringing on the CSN's efforts to generate sales
to 
retailers.  While you the customer may get your copy for free, the
retailer 
has to pay for his, and as a result, a lot of retailers choose not to
carry 
it as they consider it an added expense with little return.  By running
the 
Sonic serial, as well as other series, the CSN hopes that reader demand
will 
encourage more retailers to carry their periodical.  Two: Archie
intends to 
reprint this story somewhere down the road.  By making the story
available 
to a wide audience online risks cutting into those sales, something
neither 
Archie or Sega wants to see.

<p>Subsequently, anyone caught displaying this on their website risks
serious 
legal action from the parties involved, as they would be required to do
so 
in order to protect their overall interests.

<p>When it comes to something like this, if you're asking for my
permission, 
I can't give it, and may have to report it if asked.  This may not be
what
you want to hear, but I don't want to see anyone get burned playing
with fire, 
which this certainly is.</i>
<p>So we took the scans down. Don't want any legal trouble. Personally, I don't see how putting them up will destroy sales...anyway, I also think it is illegal for me to tell you that the picture can be viewed through a post on the Mobius Forum...

A bit of good news for you Knuckles fans from Ken Penders:
<p><i>We did get some good news just before I left for the Pittsburgh Comic Convention this past weekend.
Initially, it looked like we were going to have to cram the 3-issue KING OF THE HILL storyline
(KNUCKLES #30 through 32) into two issues and delay the Espio back-up until five issues later, but
management decided for now to leave everything as is until after the SONIC ADVENTURE crossover.

<p>Basically, they're giving the readers a chance to show their support in order to figure out what to do.
If they see positive signs from the marketplace (that's you guys), both KNUCKLES and SONIC
SUPER SPECIAL will continue as they currently are.</i>

<p>Without going into a lot of details, within the past 24 hours, any effort on behalf of saving KNUCKLES the comic could also have a profound effect as well on the possibility of other outlets for the characters in video games, toys, film, TV, etc. I'm not allowed to say more at this time, but I ask people to trust me on this one, as I've been approached by other Powers That Be expressing interest in everyone's favorite echidna. Talk about timing> I couldn't believe it myself.



<p>In regards to doing whatever you can, if anyone can afford to buy an extra copy, please don't just stash it away. Give it to a friend or relative who doesn't read the book. Share the fun with kids on your street. For those who can't afford an extra copy, but do buy KNUCKLES on a regular basis, let the retailer know you're interested in buying the book if you don't see it on their shelves. If they need more than just your order, round up a couple of friends. Whatever you do, be positive, and more importantly, be polite. If anyone has other suggestions, share them with your friends.



<p>All of you can make a difference, even if you're not doing something on a daily basis, or think anything you do won't achieve the desired results. I won't be posting on a daily or even weekly basis regarding this as even I don't get the information except on a sporadic basis. However, I do know that if I just sit around and do nothing, or worse yet -- think negative, then it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy and the books will indeed go by the way of the dinosaur.



<p>The Suits will pay attention if you give them a reason to. This is Sonic fandom's chance to show everyone that they really do matter.</i>

<b><font face="arial">Sonic HQ to Help Knuckles...Possibly</font></b> - Vector 1:11pm CST, 4-16-99</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

Here is part of a letter WB posted on Ken Penders' message board:

<p><i>Sonic is already set with SA coming along and everything else unless SEGA makes a monumental screw up - but lets not start that discussion now. Sonic Adventure is already coming out so that will push sales up more. BUT - What if Sonic HQ started a page encouraging people to "Save Knuckles". In other words encouraging a "procott" and letter writing campaign. Procott meaning like what Mr. Penders suggested - encouraging people to buy MORE Knuckles and Sonic comics and encouraging thier friends to do the same. And at the same time - generating a MASS LATTER WRITING campaign to Wal Mart to put comic books back on the shelf - particularly Archie Comics because of their "wwholesomeness and family comics" - and not punish everyone thanks to the mindlessness of one whiny woman.



<p>I think its a good idea that could work if done properly. Sonic fans couldn't save the SatAM Sonic cartoon unfortunately - but an organized campaign by one of the larger websites and maybe any others if they were willing to help - to make SURE Sonic and Knuckles stay on the shelf - might help. Get MORE PEOPLE to learn about Sonic and Knuckles comics and at the same time - keep the rest of the comics from going extinct. It would also generate more popularity for the "funny animal" comic, if we could do this right. Sonic has a lot of respect in that area anyway among comic books. Cause if Knuckles goes, how long before Sonic falls also?



<p>Also - we could get other guys to back us - like writing to the Comic Book Defense Fund, and blueribbon.com (a KNOWN Free Speech candidate - Free Speech being the right for Wal mart to not ban EVERYTHING thanks to one person). If we hold MASS letter writing campaigns to guys like that AND Wal mart and at the same time hold a large "procott" to buy more books for those that can afford it, we think we could rectify the situation of having Knuckles drop on the cancellation bucket.



<p>So what do you guys think? You too Mr. Penders. A lot of guys at HQ are willing to do it with some advice and asked me to type this letter out to pass it by you all - Mr. P. in particular. >:P It'd take a while to get set up, but we have a few plans. And BTW, all rabid Archie haters can stay out of this. We're trying to do this _as a SONIC FANDOM_ - not a separate entity. Thats where we failed in SatAM Sonic. Either youre for it, or not.



<p>What do you think Mr. Penders?

As good as I thought this special would be, it's even better, as everyone -- Jim, Colleen, James and Spaz have done some of their best work. I think everyone's going to go wild over Bunnie's new look, what happens to Lupe, Hershey's status as a character, Sally's decision on whether to submit to the Source of All, and Spaz's mind-blowing artwork on Julie-Su, not to mention the family history that will be revealed. I would not be surprised at all if we receive a great demand for more.



<p>Speaking of Colleen Doran, she's going to be pencilling the Espio back-up stories in KNUCKLES #30 through #32, as Manny is getting adjusted to life as a new dad.

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

This will probably upset a lot of you, but, here's what Ken Penders said earlier today:

<p><i>I'm not one to normally do something like this, as I recognize immediately that some people will claim my motivation is strictly

self-interest. To be honest, self-interest does play a part, but only to a certain extent. However, when the deck keeps geeting

stacked against you, you tend to resort to everything and anything in the hope that something will work.



<p>The problem is this...because various suits have affected the way KNUCKLES is distributed, KNUCKLES is now on the

endangered list, with the very real possibility of being published only nine times a year, maybe six, or even being outright

cancelled.



<p>How can this be so? you ask. Let me explain.



<p>Months ago, some woman complained to a manager at a WalMart that her child bought a comic book with offensive material

at his store. Rather than simply not carry the offending title, WalMart made the corporate-wide decision to not carry ANY

comics altogether. This resulted in 10,000 less copies of KNUCKLES alone being sold.



<p>While some of those readers probably bought subscriptions, the majority went looking for other sources. Unfortunately, despite

the overwhelming evidence that SONIC and KNUCKLES would only bring in more customers, many comics retailers still

refused to increase their orders. As for other outlets, they've proven to be hit and miss due to various factors with newstand

distribution.



<p>Which brings us to the second shoe being dropped: how the current system of newstand distribution could spell disaster for

KNUCKLES fans.



<p>In case anyone hasn't noticed lately, there are more magazines being published than there is room in stores to display them for

sale. That means if you wish to get your product to market, you have to jump through the hoops set up by newstand

distributors. Recently, the distributors have decided to charge more money for less space. That means a publisher like Archie

has to cough up more money to maintain every title on the newstand they currently publish, or...



<p>...they could pay the same amount and get less shelf space, resulting in some books getting cancelled, and others scaled back in

their frequency of publication.



<p>While SONIC has been a solid performer with name-brand recognition, for some reason, both KNUCKLES and SONIC

SUPER SPECIAL have a harder time getting through the food chain and into the readers hands.



<p>Be that as it may, the fact is, the publishers don't care about the whys and wherefores. They're not looking for explanations.

Either a book sells or it doesn't. While that may not be fair from a fan's point of view, this is how business is currently

conducted in America today.



<p>Now that we've defined the problem, that various factors are making it more difficult than ever for KNUCKLES' fans to follow

their hero, we obviously need a solution, and in this case, there's only one. The only one the publishers will listen to.



<p>If you really, truly think the book is worthy of your time and effort, I recommend that everyone who feels this way buy one

extra copy for six months and pass 'em along to different friends, getting them hooked. 



<p>I say six months for two reasons. One: it's going to take that long for the initial sales figures to reach Archie, and Two: it's going

to take several months of steady sales to encourage the publishers to maintain KNUCKLES on a monthly basis. As it stands

now, after issue #35, there's a very real chance of a "skip" month between every 3-issue story, resulting in only nine issues a

year of KNUCKLES. Once that happens, it'll be a long time, if ever, before KNUCKLES is fully restored to 12 issues a year.



<p>If anyone has really looked at what's on the magazine racks these days, you know that both the retailer and the distributor

make more money selling Time, Newsweek, Better Homes and Gardens, etc., than they do selling comic books. Therefore, if

you wish to save that which you enjoy, you have to make the effort to show that support. The more fans that do come through,

the louder the message will be.



<p>So start by spreading the word, and if anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to ask.</i>

<p>The Ken went on to say that:

<p><i>One of the factors I didn't carefully explain is why a book like KNUCKLES can be on the endangered list, despite being one

of the better selling titles on the market. Because Sega owns KNUCKLES, Archie has to pay them a fee each time an issue is

published, therefore when you factor this in and other budget costs, it costs Archie more to produce KNUCKLES than, say,

your typical issue of BETTY & VERONICA. Because of that, if Archie's share of the profit on KNUCKLES doesn't exceed

that of BETTY & VERONICA's, the company doesn't consider publishing the book to be worthwhile to them. After all, they

don't own the character, so they can't exploit it like they can their own.



<p>Personally, I don't understand it, either, but the concept of not making enough of a profit is just as bad as actually losing money

to a lot of companies these days. They expect to make a certain amount, and if they don't make it, they look for any excuse to

cut costs, figuring the product wasn't good enough even though other factors, such as distribution difficulties and costs in this

case, were the main reason the product wasn't exposed to the widest possible audience looking for it.</i>

<p>So what could we do to help? Personal suggestion: complain to Wal-mart, since their the ones that started this whole mess in the first place. When they get over 100 complaints on one thing, they'll probably question their decisions.

5) The first Sonic page to have extensive news coverage of all Sonic events.<br>

6) The first Sonic page to establish a well formed message forum AKA Mobius Forum.<br>

7) The first Sonic page with interviews.<br>

8) The first Sonic page with a Trade Forum (and Sonic Store).

<p>On Sunday, JD Harding announced that his site, <a href=http://tolwyn.simplenet.com/sonic/>The Sonic Corner</a>, would no longer be updated.  This quote was taken from TSC's Updates page:



<p><i>This site will not be updated anymore. This is the last and final update. I'm very busy and I don't have any more spare time to work on this site. I'm sorry about this, but I must stop updating TSC. I'm beginning professional work on Music, and I cannot be bothered with this site.</i>



<p>Knuxcom closed less than a week ago, and now another of the greatest Sonic sites will no longer be updated.  Fortunately, it sounds like TSC will still be available in the future.

I learned of this news from <a href=http://www.wheres.com/etc/sonic/>The Super Sonic Zone</a>.



<p>Another Simplenet site is closing.  This time it's <a href=http://wsonic.simplenet.com>World Sonic</a>.



<p><i>On March 1, 1999, Dash talked with his staff about a "new" website. It was suppose to be called E Productions. E Productions would be a fanmade company that made fancomics. Of coarse, that suggestion did not become a reality, but something else did.



<p>The next day, Dash (that's me!) went around the net asking people in message boards and e-mailing them personally about what they thought about World Sonic. Most of them said the site is good, but not real good. But the loudest answer I heard was The Sonic Saga. Everyone I asked said that The Sonic Saga looks real promising and couldn't wait to see it done. Then I remembered that I haven't been putting that much time into the making of The Sonic Saga, but instead, putting all of my time into World Sonic. That's when my mind clicked.



<p>Why keep a Sonic site that dose not receive good responses from the visitors? Why not make a website about something that people like. The Sonic Saga! 



<p>With a new website, all about The Sonic Saga, I would be able to put A LOT more time into making the comic. And without World Sonic to worry about, I could make The Sonic Saga into a great fancomic! 



<p>So, that's what I'm doing. I'm closing down World Sonic and opening a new The Sonic Saga webpage! However, this may only be temporary. Because I have the World Sonic webpage loaded into my Computers hardrive, I could upload it back up on the net anytime I want. This means NO ONE can copy the World Sonic name or it's design. Their both copyrighted by me and I'm not giving them up.



<p>This is great for me really! That's why I'm doing it. Now, about the features on World Sonic like the interview and fancomics page. Here is a list of things that were on World Sonic that will still be on the new The Sonic Saga webpage. 



<p><ul><li>Danehog's fancomic, STH: Character Chaos Zone<br> 

<li>Interview's<br> 

<li>Downloads</ul>



<p>That's all. Everything else, like the fangame, will be canceled. Sorry. Also, keep in mind that the new website will stay at this domain (Http://wsonic.simplenet.com) and will not move!"</i>

But in another form -- Eggman! This is what Paul Castiglia has to say about it:

<p><i>Hey, gang.  Paul Castiglia here.  After several discussions with editor

Justin Freddy Gabrie, we've decided to reveal (well not entirely --

you'll 

have to read the comic for the complete story!) what we've got in store

for 

you in Sonic The Hedgehog #75, which heads your way this July.  It just

might 

be the beginning of a return to "status quo".  It's definitely the

return of 

Robotnik -- wait till you find out just what he is and how he got that

way!  

It should all make sense soon...

<p>IT'S THE MOMENT SONIC AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE BEEN DREADING: THE RETURN OF

THE 

WRETCHED DR. ROBOTNIK, IN THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE OF SONIC THE

HEDGEHOG! 

<p>Get set for not one, but two milestones for Sonic and his pals this

July!  

First off, we're proud to present the 75th issue of Sonic's monthly

comic 

series.  Since Sonic's debut in 1992, many comic series sprung up, but

just 

as quickly, many fizzled out as well.  But Sonic's legion of faithful

fans -- 

many of which take their hero's exploits as seriously as fans of "Star

Trek",

have proven that when it comes to longevity, look no further than

Sonic!  

He's been going strong from the get-go.  The same can't be said for the

evil 

Dr. Robotnik, Sonic's sworn enemy.  After terrorizing the blue blur and

the 

other Freedom Fighters for 50 issues, Sonic finally defeated the

maniacal 

menace.  Or so he thought!  Now, 2 years and 25 issues after his

apparent 

demise, Dr. Robotnik returns to once again wreak havoc on the peaceful 

citizens of Knothole Village!  If you read only one comic this summer, 

THIS IS IT!    



<p>SONIC THE HEDGEHOG #75, OCT. cover date, ships 7/9.  32-page, full

color comic,

$1.79 US; $1.99 CANADA.  "I Am The Eggman": In this issue-length

nail-biter, 

Dr. Robotnik is back -- and he's carrying a whole new bag of tricks and

surprises!  For starters, he's imprisoned Sonic and The Freedom

Fighters 

and he intends to roboticize them!  Isn't this where we all came in?!?!



<p>SCRIPT: Karl Bollers.  ART: Steven Butler and Pam Eklund.</i>

<p>LOL, "I Am the Eggman"...this is probably a very good move from the economic stance, this change will take place right before Sonic Adventure arrives, so all the new fans will know what the comic is talking about right away.

Allessandro Sanasi gave his opinions of the new cartoon on the newsgroup.

<p><i>Hello.



<p>About a week ago, Traitor (traitor@thegrid.net) asked me about my personal  

opinion about the show... for your reading pleasure, here is what I  

replied:



<p>First off, just in case some of you don't know already, I put up some nice  

online information about this cartoon at



<p>http://www.franken.de/users/deco/su/su.html<br>

and<br>

http://www.franken.de/users/deco/su/su_news.html



<p>It gives a general overview of the characters, as well as some basic  

information about the plot itself.



<p>IMHO, Sonic Underground can be considered as a mix between the SatAM  

cartoon and the syndicated "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" cartoon,  

with the stronger tendency going toward SatAM.  The animation is well  

done, and the scenes show lots of dynamic and speed (especially during  

fights), sometimes even more dynamic than they had in SatAM.



<p>However, while SatAM showed Robotnik as someone who wanted to 'own' the  

whole planet, turn everyone with no exception into robots and pollute  

everything with his machines, forcing the Freedom Fighters to hide away in  

the forest, in the new cartoon he is only a 'normal' dictator who is  

satisfied to 'own' only _Robotropolis_ and rule over the rest of the  

population with his army of SWATbots, without roboticizing them.   

Therefore, most of the cities on Mobius are still undamaged and well  

populated.  The aristocratic (rich) furries on Mobius even have some kind  

of VIP status because Robotnik needs their support (mostly money) to  

finance his dictatorship.



<p>Of course Robotnik still captures and roboticizes furries once in a while,  

but it's only a very small fraction of the total population.  Also, the  

furries aren't turned totally into metal, they simply get robotic 'parts'  

added that make them obedient slaves.



<p>Another thing to mention is that the 'variety' of different-looking  

species that we had in the SatAM version is pretty much gone.  Most of the  

supporting cast looks pretty generic.  Usually they have human-shaped  

bodies (although a lot slimmer), 'dog' faces with button noses and small  

'dog' ears.  When they do use characters that differ from this generic  

style, usually they are hideously ugly and mis-shaped.  The 'hip' Mobian  

outfit consisting only of gloves, shoes and maybe a belt or hat is also  

pretty much gone.  Apart from Sonic & siblings, usually everyone is  

completely dressed.



<p>Sonic, Manic and Sonia all have different personalities, abilities and  

skills, which IMHO is a plus.  For example, Sonia is the more adept person  

when it comes to things like remote-controlling a plane or scanning for  

SWATbots, and is also a very emotional and caring person, while Manic is  

better with opening locks, pickpocketing and bypassing security.  Sonic is  

his usual fast, witty and impatient self as always, and the born leader  

and fighter.



<p>This variety among the three main characters _does_ offer a lot of  

possibilities for interesting plots, but when comparing it with SatAM I  

have to say that it 'stays behind'.  Or to say it simply, I think it is  

more interesting when for example Sonic's girlfriend Sally gets captured  

by Robotnik than Sonic's sibling Sonia, or when Sally falls for a cute  

handsome guy and Sonic trying to re-gain her attention than when Sonia  

falls in love.  It's a fact that people always care more when for example  

cute little Tails gets captured than when it happens to 'heroes' like  

Manic, who can pretty much fight back on their own.



<p>All the interesting relationships that the Knothole Freedom Fighters  

offered, like Sonic's and Sally's love for one another (although none of  

them wanted to admit it openly), Sally's relationship to Tails, who loved  

him almost like her own kid, while Tails called her 'Aunt', Tails'  

adoration for Sonic, Bunnie's cuteness and friendliness, although she  

suffered greatly from being half robot, Antoine the jerk, who always tried  

to impress the princess, or Rotor the tinkerer, always there with a  

fitting gadget when there was a need.  But in the new cartoon, the main  

cast is only those three hedgehogs, and all relationship that will ever be  

among them, and all their reason to come to the rescue when one of them is  

in danger will always be nothing more but the relationship that is between  

siblings.  Sonic coming to the rescue for his 'love', or to save his  

'little bro', and all the fun interaction that was possible between the  

SatAM characters will not be possible in the new cartoon.  Sonic &  

siblings still make jokes among each other, and still have conflicts and  

emotional stuff to handle, but because they are brothers and sister, it  

will never get as deep as it was possible in SatAM.



<p>And finally, because Sonic & siblings have formed a band in this series,  

each episode features a small musical interlude, either a 'stage  

performance' or something in the line of an 'MTV video clip' thrown in.



<p>Now to sum it all up, IMHO Sonic Underground is worth watching, especially  

when you already are a Sonic fan.  It has pretty decent artwork, mostly  

interesting, funny and exciting plots, fast-paced action, and Sonic &  

siblings all act pretty cool, especially during fights.  The stories are  

less 'dark' than SatAM was (mainly because Robotnik doesn't want to  

pollute the whole planet and turn all living beings into robots, but is  

instead satisfied to just rule over its population), but luckily don't  

slip to the AoStH level.  The supporting characters are more 'generic' in  

appearance, taking away a bit from the true 'Mobian' feeling.  What SatAM  

fans will miss the most however is the lack of characters like Sally or  

Tails... but I guess we have to live with that.



<p>As a final note, I would like to tell everyone that IMHO the musical  

interludes _suck_, because they almost always feel like a 'break' in the  

storyflow than helping it along, and all the added computer effects (to  

give it the typical 'MTV' feel) do the rest. ;)



<p>And that's that...



<p>Bye



<p><br>Alessandro<br>

---<br>

You get what anyone gets. You get a lifetime.</i>



<p>Good news (depending on your taste) and bad news, I guess.  IMHO, it sounds like DiC has handled Robotnik better than they had in the previous cartoons, though the "generic furries" sound rather disappointing.

Ever since Ken Penders announced his own comic, The Lost Ones, people have started to question if he will leave Archie to pursue his own interests. In the month's Archie editorial, he answered the question:

<p><i>Does this mean I've quit working on SONIC and KNUCKLES? That

   I'm leaving Archie?



   <p>Far from it. I can't say enough about what an enjoyable experience it's

   been working on not only SONIC and KNUCKLES, but on the flagship

   characters like ARCHIE, BETTY and JUGHEAD, to say nothing of

   JAGUAR and THE SHIELD. I also can't say enough about the terrific

Special, and we were so impressed, that she's going to be handling the pencils to the Espio back-up story in KNUCKLES #30
through #32 while Manny gets adjusted to life as a new father. (His wife recently gave birth to a baby boy which they named
Jacen. I believe that's the correct spelling, but not 100% sure.) Jim Valentino returns to handle the back-up stories in
KNUCKLES #33 through 35 during the SONIC ADVENTURE CROSSOVER. (#33 features Big the Cat, #34 spotlights
E-102 and #35 wraps up with Knuckles.) Vector or Charmy will then follow.</i>
<p>Ken also said that he might have a chat room up and running on his site soon. BTW, Manny named his son after Jacen, Leia and Han Solo's oldest offspring (read the Star Wars books).
