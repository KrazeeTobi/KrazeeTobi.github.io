<p><a href="http://www.dcswirl.com/">DC Swirl</a> is reporting that the ESRB, the company responsible for rating games into age categories (Kids to Adults, Teen, etc.) have rated the first wave of Dreamcast games.  Included in that batch is Sonic Adventure, and it received an E rating, meaning it's for everyone.  This comes as no surprise since all other Sonic games preceding SA have received an E or K-A (Kids to Adults) rating.

That's the question nowadays, isn't it? What has the Sonic Team been up to since they finished Sonic Adventure way back in last December? Nex Gen Magazine (Next Generation with a new style and name change) sorta answered it in a short interview:
<p>NG: We heard the Sonic Team split into groups... 

<p>Yuji Naka: There are lots of rumors. Sometimes I go on the internet, and find so many rumors, I really have to laugh. Players want a sequel to Sonic Adventure, Burning Rangers, and Nights, so the rumor spreads on the net that the Sonic Team split into three groups. I don't want to break people's dreams, but I am making none of these games! Rumors are are very interesting... 

<p>NG: So what is next for Sonic Team? 

<p>Yuji Naka: It's a big secret (laughs).

I've talked with Mr. Penders about SEGA owning characters like Julie-Su and 
St. John (article below), this is what he said:
<p><i>Part of the contract Sega has with Archie stipulates any and allcharacters 
created in the Sonic and Knuckles comic books become property of Sega.(The 
SOLE EXCEPTIONS being Sonic Super Special #7 and 10, for obviousreasons.) 
Thus, Sega now owns everything I created in the Knuckles series,including 
Locke, Lara-Le and Julie-Su, to say nothing of characters like Geoffrey St. 
John, Hershey, Doctor Quack and Rob O' the Hedge, to name but a few.
<p>As a professional, I knew that going in, and had no qualms at the time.Now 
that I'm creating my own series, however, I must admit certain ideaswill 
probably never make it into the Sonic books, as I'm keeping those for my own use.</i>

The August 2nd issue TIME Magazine did a nice priview of the Dreamcast on page 98. It had a short review of Sonic Adventure, here it is thanks to me :-)
<p><i>Take Sonic Adventure, a revamped version of that Sega classic Sonic the Hedgehog, which the company is marketing as the quintessential Dreamcast game. The visuals are 3-Delicious -- Sonic's footprints appear in the sand as he zooms by, while the sun glints in the lens just as it should. But dismal attempts at midair loop-the-loops left me cursing at controls that always seemed a step behind the speedy blue hedgehog. Perhaps my synapses simply don't fire fast enough. Then again, I'm hardly the target audience for Sonic Adventure. -- By Chris Taylor</i>
<p>Over all, the article is very possitive for the DC. Glad to see the media actually play in Sega's favor for once...

<p>If you don't have time to read them all, here's the specific quote about Sonic's TV spot aired on MTV's Music Awards on 9-9-99:
<p><i>"Opening Day" will be the first of the spots. It will use
                       Dreamcast-created animation to display a varied cast of
                       Sega characters interacting with each other and also
                       Brian Grant of the Portland Trailblazers.
<p>"Daydream" will be devoted to Sonic Adventure. Like
                       "Bad Old Days," this one will also consist of nothing but
                       animation. My home-town hero Gary Payton (good
                       choice, but Detlef Schrempf is much more photogenic)
                       will party with Taka (what, are sumo wrestlers popular
                       with the kids these days?) and Sonic will deejay at a club
                       with over forty Sega characters in attendance. Should be
                       fun spotting all the old favorites (will Vectorman be there?
                       The Streets of Rage crew? Ecco? Me, I'm hoping for
                       Alex Kidd). </i>
<p>The DC marketing will really take off on August 9th, when a 60 second all-DC-rendered ad called "Apocalypse" hits MTV, Fox, the WB, UPN, USA, ESPN, ZDTV, The Box, and WWF. The producer of this commercial is calling it an epic...guess we'll see.

Here's a press release about the upcoming Knuckles The Most Dangerous Game arc (#30-#32) from Diamond Previews:
<p>Knuckles Plays "The Most Dangerous Game"
<p>An exciting new three-issue story arc in Archie Comics’ Knuckles finds the fan-favorite echidna teaming with one enemy to outwit another. Creators Ken Penders and Harvey Mercadoocasio kick off the story "King of the Hill" with Part One in Knuckles #30 (JUN991160, $1.79). This issue is scheduled to ship Aug. 27.
<p>"King of the Hill" finds Knuckles facing off against his childhood rival, Monk the gorilla, in a battle bringing a lifetime of grievances to bear. The battle is short-lived, however, as a big game hunter returns to the Floating Island looking for fresh sport and decides to go after them both. The unwilling pair must cooperate if they wish to live, which makes for a lively tale full of danger and excitement as they try to hunt the hunter.
<p>The epic story develops complications in Knuckles #31 (JUL991207, $1.79), and the grand finale appears in issue #32 (AUG991285, $1.79), offered in the August Previews. 
<p>These three issues also feature a Chaotix Team backup story starring Espio, written by Ken Penders with art by Colleen Doran and Andrew Pepoy.
<p>Don’t miss this exciting "mini-series within a series," which makes a perfect introduction to this great title.

                  programming parents of everyone's favorite blue hedgehog are said to be
                  working on two new games, one of which may be a sequel. While Yuji
                  Naka himself is hesitant to release any information at this point in time, it's
                  clear that he's looking for at least two graphics artists, and seven people to
                  work specifically on CG movies.</i>
<p>If you think you're good enough, please contact the <a href="sonicteam@sega.co.jp">Sonic Team</a> (j/k). Wonder what the 2 new games are...

Fans have more and more power these days as software and hardware evolve, letting us do more things in less time. Several fans have said that they'll be doing a Sonic movie, some even in 3D. This one, has already got started. It's called A Super Sonic Destiny. Click <a href="http://wsonic.simplenet.com/sonicmovie.htm">here</a> to view it and download a few preview movies.

Ken Penders had this to say when Mobius Forum members started questioning Sonic's first name:
<p><i>Sonic's first name is NOT Christopher or any popular name you can think of.
     If anything, his first name is something so uncool, which explains why he
     prefers to be known as Sonic.

     <p>Basically, Sega prefers we not acknowledge he has a real name beyond Sonic,
     but they haven't come right out and said Sonic is his real name either, just
     that it's the name he's known by.

     <p>As for whether we'll ever know the final definitive fact, only time and Sega
     can say for sure.</i>

Here's a long review of Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition by <a href="mailto:hawkmoon@concentric.net">Hawkmoon</a>:
<p>As some of you may know, I have played the Japanese
                       version of Sonic Adventure extensiveley. I just finished
                       playing the American version from Blockbuster and I
                       am here to report the changes that I have seen so far...

                       <p>(Voices)<br> 
                       The voice acting in the game is not that bad. Sonic
                       sounds older than tails and that is the way it should be.
                       Knuckles does not sound as menacing as he should, but
                       his voice sounds to be in the same age group as Sonic.
                       I thought the voice for Dr. Robotnik (Eggman) was
                       pretty good. Amy's voice is good as is E102. Big the cat
                       has the worst voice (thank god his portion of the game
                       is short). 

                       <p>(Why Dr. Robotnick is called Eggman)<br> 
                       Dr. Robotnik is reffered to as Eggman. There is a reason
                       for this. When the Dr. makes his second appearance in
                       the game (near Tails workshop) Sonic & Tails sees the
                       Dr. Sonic makes smart butt comment "Look it's a giant
                       talking Egg". The Dr. replies, "I am Dr. Robotnik", Sonic
                       says "Whatever Eggman". Later in the game when the
                       Dr. tells E102 to attack Sonic, E102 responds by saying
                       "Yes Dr. Robotnik". This is the reason the Dr. is refered
                       to as Eggman. 

                       <p>(More Voice information)<br> 
                       There is alot of voice in the game. What was really cool
                       is when you enter the train station a female voice says
                       "The train headed for Mystic Ruins will be departing
                       soon" the voice is echoed as if it is heard in a large
                       train station. A male voice is used at Mystic Ruins.
                       Sonic and the other character have alot of voice when
                       you leave the controller and let the character sit there.
                       Sonic mentions "Better get going", hey, hey, hey,
                       theres no time to rest". Depending on the location of
                       the character, they say different things as well. 

                       <p>The options menu's also have voices telling you
                       information. When you go to the sound menu a female
                       voice states "Sound Test. You can listen to various
                       music tracks". 

                       <p>(Camera)<br> 
                       The camera has been worked on. It still needs some
                       more work but it is much better than the japanese
                       game. For example in the Hotel Lobby, the camera is
                       fixed lower and closer to Sonic. In the shop, the one
                       with the Egg in the window, the camera is fixed in one
                       view. In tails workshop, the camera is fixed so that you
                       don't get stuck looking at a wall. On the japanese
                       version when you start running from the whale, the
                       camera at times would be under the bridge. On the
                       American version, I could not get it to do it. It would
                       happen at least once every 3-4 playthroughs on the
                       japanese version. 

                       <p>Using the D-Pad allows you to look around and the
                       triggers change the camera angle just like the
                       japanese version, but the american one seems to have
                       more freedom. I was able to look around in some levels
                       using the triggers and saw things that I never say in
                       the japanese version. 

                       <p>(Other stuff)<br> 
                       The internet option is not available as someone else
                       reported. The menu states the following will be offered:

                       <p>Communication<br> 
                       Game Hints <br>
                       Game Downloads <br>
                       Data Exchange <br>
                       World Rankings <br>
                       NOTE: No On-Line play as previously mentioned! 

                       <p>It also says that the Sonic Adventure Home Page will
                       available on 9.9.99. 

                       <p>It may be my faulty memory, but I noticed different
                       camera angles when you have close encounters
                       (voiced parts) with other characters. I also noticed
                       additional paths on the Windy Valley level. On the Sky
                       Deck, I went through a sequence that I did not go
                       through before. Until, I can play my Japanese version
                       again, I will only say that if my memory serves me
                       well, then there has been some additions. 

                       <p>(Some more other stuff)<br> 
                       Like a typical RPG, when you talk to people sometimes
                       you have to talk to them again for them to say
                       something else. They will also say different things
                       depending on time of day and what point in the game
                       you are in. 

                       <p>I actually liked the dialogue in the game. Parts of it
                       seem a little kiddie, others are quite funny. The game is
                       geared towards a younger crowd, so I expected this.
                       overall, I really enjoyed the dialogue. Cheesy at some
                       points, good in others. 

                       <p>(Overall)<br> 
                       Even though the is a "LIMITED EDITION" and I do not
                       know what differences there will be in the final product,
                       I think that it will do extremly well. The game is
                       beutiful, I actually stopped and just looked around to
                       see the sights. Even though I played the japanese
                       version, beat it with every character (twice), I still was
                       blown away by the visuals. For me, this will be a title I
                       pick up at launch. It probably won't get played much
                       the first week (with all the other releases), it is still a
                       treasure to have. 

                       <p>The game came w/no instruction manual, but below is
                       what it says on the back of the game package. 

                       <p>Buckle up and we're talking 5-point harness. sonic the

The differences in a nutshell: 

                       <p>Graphics-wise, some of the areas which had slowdown
                       are improved, and the slowdown is lessened or
                       eliminated. For instance, in Amy's stage, the first time
                       the robot breaks through the glass, it slowed down in
                       the import. The US version doesn't, although there's a
                       slight hiccup a little later in that scene, it's way better.
                       The camera is also better on character tracking. 

                       <p>As far as the music, it's all the same in this version. 

                       <p>Voices are a mixed bag. While i wouldn't call any of
                       them great by any means, they're decent, except for
                       Big's voice. Irritating in the import, horrendously
                       annoying in the domestic. He sounds like a teletubbie
                       with the pitch in it's voice turned way down. 

                       <p>Sonic's voice is okay; sounds kinda like a 15-year old.
                       Amy's sounds more like an actual woman compared to
                       the hyper-kawaii voice of the import. Knuckle's
                       downright sucks. He's lost the badass voice that the
                       Japanese version had, and sounds almost like he could
                       be Sonic's brother. Tails' sounds like a little kid; not
                       bad. Robotnik (who is mysteriously called Eggman in
                       the US version!! ^_^) sounds... fake. Can't say why
                       exactly because i don't remember what it sounded like
                       exactly. 

                       <p>And Tikal, well... she sounds like a tired woman. Kinda
                       like the voice in Fighting Vipers. Kinda disappointing,
                       since i really wanted to see her get a voice that
                       matched her character (Amy's is better matched). 
<p>
                       The lip-synching isn't the best, but i think it's a bit
                       better than the import, where Sonic's lips moved two
                       seconds after he stopped talking.

Below are some Sonic Adventure: Special Edition comments made by some gamers from different spots on the 'net:
<p><LI>Sonic, wow. I've never really seen the import version, but from what I read, there were some
    problems with the camera. Well, I guess there still is. Mostly in the Adventure zones. Does'nt really
    bother me. I guess this is a incomplete version hence the "Limited Edition" logo. Also the voice
    overs are'nt synced with the lips on the characters. They put captions like in MGS but you can take
    'em off. Sonic sounds like Robin from the Batman cartoons and Tails, well, sounds like a kid. Don't
    get me wrong, they sound great. The graphics are SWEET! (by Cornhead)
<p><LI>An overall pretty fun night [the DC rental kick off party in LA), but the best moment of it was when I
    saw Sonic come out in his costume being cheered by the crowd. I just thought to myself that Sega
    hasn't been forgotten and it looked like the crowd accepted Sega again. They came up to Sonic and
    hugged him and shook his hand which kinda brought a tear to my eyes =P This was the moment I
    knew that Sega is back, and the public seemed to forget thier past. (by <a href="mailto:Sloth69@msn.com">Sloth</a>)
<p><LI>The music is cool, sort of. It essentially sounds like
                       what happens when an American video producer
                       re-does the music for dubbed anime: J-pop with crappy
                       US lyrics. The music was supposed to have been
                       re-done by Chris Vrenna (NIN), but I don't hear any
                       really hard stuff in there. 

                       <p>Sonic's voice isn't too bad (it sounds familiar actually),
                       Tails' voice is annoying, both he and Amy sound like
                       they're about 7 years old. Knuckles' voice is tolerable.
                       Big the Cat sounds like that old Warner Bros cartoon
                       character that used say things like "Duh, Which was did
                       he go George?....He is my pretty bunny and I will hold
                       him and stroke him and love him and pet him..." It's
                       slightly comical at first, listening to him whine about his
                       lost "Froggy," but eventually his tone starts to grate on
                       the nerves. 

                       <p>All the dialogue is super-cheesy as well...and yes, the
                       voices are improperly synched with the characters'
                       lips, making it look like a poor Godzilla movies. I
                       honestly don't think Sega has touched this title very
                       much, I mean, how hard would it have been to get the
                       lip synch done properly? 

                       <p>...I can't say how the game mechanics have been
                       adjusted, but I will say that yes, there are some
                       screwy bugs, some nasty camera problems, and
                       noticeable (to me at least) framerate dropoffs... 

                       <p>...the final intersting thing to note is that there's a
                       menu option for "Internet" - selecting it yeilds a little
                       splash screen about how you'll be able to post times,
                       get codes, download games, and compete over the
                       internet. Then it says that this "Special Edition" of Sonic
                       Adventure is not equipped for internet features, and to
                       get the full version when it arrives. (by <a href="mailto:sefton@mediaone.net">border</a>)

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

<a href="http://www.gaming-age.com">Gaming-Age</a>'s Craig Majaski did a special report about the new Sonic Adventure demos that's poping up in a Toys R Us and Funcoland near you:
<p>Earlier tonight I took a 20 mile trip to the "big city" (hey, I live in a town of 800 people so it
    doesn't take much to qualify as a big city) and headed straight to Toys R Us in hopes of finally
    being able to play Sega's newest machine. Unfortunately the store had yet to receive it's demo
    unit so I sauntered on over to Best Buy, but no Dreamcast there either. Before giving up I
    suddenly thought of Funcoland. While I was doubtful they'd have the system, I figured what the
    heck. I entered the store and right away noticed Driver was available for play on the PlayStation.
    Scanning the store I didn't see a Dreamcast set up so I started to play what many are calling the
    best racing game to come out in a long time. After a few minutes an employee asked if I had any
    questions and I of course asked when they'd be getting a Dreamcast in so I could give it a try. To
    my surprise he pointed to the back of the store where they just happened to have one hooked up
    to a 13" GXTV. I immediately dropped my PlayStation controller and rushed over to the system. 

    <p>Upon picking up the Dreamcast controller I immediately noticed how incredibly light it felt. In fact,
    my first impression was that the controller was rather cheaply made. Of course the store didn't
    have a VMU or Force Pak in the controller so that's probably the reason. Also, the system itself is
    extremely small. It's hard to believe that such a powerful system is in such a small case. Looking
    back at the TV, I noticed that Sonic was already playing so I hit the Start button and reset the
    game. The title screen came up and under the game's name was "Special Edition". I immediately
    figured out that this special edition didn't have the Internet functionality built in yet and perhaps
    not all of the stages are present in this version. I then began the game with Sonic as my
    character of choice, taking note of the short load times. There was a brief story and then the
    adventure mode started. At first I didn't know what I was doing and it didn't take me too long to
    accidentally fall off a ledge and die. Once I got Sonic's controls down I became used to the
    controller. While I had heard many comments about the controller being too small, it seemed to
    fit my hands nicely. The analog stick is very accurate and feels much better than Sony's Dual
    Shock. I'll have to give it more playtime before I can compare it to Nintendo's stick, but the
    Dreamcast controller is much better than the one that was packaged with Nights on the Saturn,
    even though they do look somewhat similar aesthetically. 

    <p>Controlling Sonic became a very easy affair in no time at all. Basically you just point the control
    stick in a direction and he'll move there. The spin dash and a double jump of sorts are a couple
    of his special moves. After walking around in the adventure mode I became bored and reset the
    system again. I knew the store would be closing soon so I really wanted to see some fast paced
    action. This time I picked a different option, which at the moment really escapes my mind as to
    what it was called. The game put me in one of the "action" stages and this is truly where the
    game shines. Think back to the first time you ever played Sonic and marveled at the game's
    speed. It's amazing, but somehow Sega managed to capture that same sense of awe but this
    time in complete 3D. The stage I played was the one with the huge whale that tries to attack you
    on the bridge. The standard speed boosters and springboards are placed strategically throughout
    the course, which enable Sonic to reach new areas in the level. The loops are back and are much
    more dramatic since the camera zooms out showing the action from a different view. The graphics
    are obviously beyond anything ever before seen on a console. I did play another stage as Tails
    and that was a good time. I had to race Sonic to capture an emerald. Although I wasn't able to
    play anymore of the game, I did notice that there seemed to be a lack of enemies. Even so, from
    just 30 minutes of playtime I can tell Sega really has a hit on its hands. The game is a marvel to
    look at, the music is totally awesome with CD sound reminiscent of Sonic CD on the Sega CD, and
    to top it off the game controls pretty good. So far the only thing wrong is the camera system. It's
    a bit erratic and hard to follow. I don't know if this special edition of the game has fixed the
    glitches found in the Japanese version since I never had the opportunity to play it. Perhaps one
    of the other editors will get a chance to compare at a later date.

<a href="http://sages.ign.com">GameSages</a> have put up another part of their surprising coverage of the Sonic comics:
<p>Sonic Steals the Show!<br>
by Stratus
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog:
Upon its release, the SONIC THE HEDGEHOG comic book didn't turn manyheads. 
It was another SEGA licensed product, it was by Archie Comics ("Oh,those? I 
read those when I was a kid!"), it didn't stand out from the crowd.Indeed, 
though it survived the cancellation of both TEENAGE MUTANT NINJATURTLES and 
MUTANIMALS, it's brethren in the Archie Adventure Series line, itseemed that 
people bought it only as long as they owned a Sega Genesis and any ofthe 
Sonic games. Still, even after the SEGA steamroller slowed, SONIC keptgoing 
strong, gaining readership and acceptance in newsstands across thecountry. Why?
<p>From the beginning of publication up through the present, Sonic's bookshave 
featured something that many mainstream comics (like X-MEN or JLA)lack: 
accessibility. This doesn't mean that every issue is a stand-alonestory, but 
it does mean that the writing is reader-friendly. By that I mean thatthe 
characters are well spoken but not overly wordy, the plots areinteresting 
but not excessively intricate, and the narrative is welcoming but nottrite. 
Yes, you could say that these comics are aimed at a lower age bracketthan 
most Marvel or DC comics, but they're by no means unfit for an olderaudience.
<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say that readers reminiscent of "theold 
days" of comics should give these books a try. If nothing else, theyfeature 
an element of fun long missing in mainstream titles. They respectthings like 
continuity and characterization, but still manage to not takethemselves too 
seriously. Perhaps it's made easier because the entire casts of bothSONIC 
and KNUCKLES are furry forest critters, or because the lead villainsfeature 
names like Dr. Robotnik, but no matter the reason, these comics feature
elements that books like X-MEN have been missing for some time.
<p>Some comics (such as the Tomb Raider and Pokemon ones I'll explainfurther 
below) are popular based simply on the franchise from which they stem. 
Originally, SONIC THE HEDGEHOG was like this. As the years passed andno new 
significant Sonic games were released (after 1994's Sonic andKnuckles), one 
would assume that the comic's popularity would decrease as well, as the
character would be losing it's audience by not staying in thespotlight. Not 
so. In fact, SONIC's sales continued to grow steadily. For the mostpart, 
this happened because the comic had established itself as a separateentity 
from the video game franchise and attracted its own audience.
<p>Another interesting thing is the attraction of talent away from the 
mainstream comics field, including artists like Steven Butler(ULTRAFORCE), 
James Fry (MOON KNIGHT), and Jim Valentino (SHADOWHAWK, founding memberor 
Image Comics). Why would these gentlemen leap into something so 
unconventional, so new as the Archie Adventure Series of comics? To 
paraphrase Mr. Valentino, "Everybody is saying, ‘Where are the kids,'but 
they're right here, reading SONIC." (He's referring to theever-increasing 
average age of comic book readers, with Sonic comics being the sole exception.)
<p>Indeed they are. Call it accessibility, call it fun, call it whateveryou 
wish, but the Sonic comics are reaching a chord with the youngeraudience 
that mainstream books haven't been able to grasp. They're just good fun
comics, and that's what really attracts the readers, young and old.

the revived Saturday afternoon edition that has the following line-up

In response to a fan's opinion about Ken only cares for Knuckles now, Penders replyed:
<p><i>I'd like to set the record straight for people who are of the opinion I'm pro-Knuckles and anti-Sonic, as it bewilders me when I hear that charge.
<p>My efforts to save the KNUCKLES series are part self-interest and part love of the character, but my efforts would not be any less if I were working on SONIC. I could've been the regular writer on SONIC had I so desired way back when, but I was more intrigued with the challenge of building a title from the ground level up with KNUCKLES, so that was what factored into my decision-making process. 
<p>If I had stayed with SONIC, the series would more than likely be completely different from what you saw during the past 25 issues. This is not meant to be taken as a knock towards Karl, as he would've been the regular writer on KNUCKLES, and chances are people would be singing his praises and throwing me brickbats.
<p>I have more than a few SONIC stories still left in me, but whether or not they get told in the pages of SONIC SUPER SPECIAL remain to be seen, as that book is also suffering from distribution problems.
<p>For people to assume we're prioritizing KNUCKLES at the expense of SONIC is far from the truth, as a lot is riding on the health of all of the books. </i>

He will bring balance to the planet Mobius, he's none other than Tails! And his story might just get delayed because of that something special (see below) starting at Knuckles #35! Here's what Ken said:
<p><i>At this point, I honestly don't know what the status is. I'm currently evaluating which [story] would seem a
more natural follow-up to the events in KNUCKLES #35, and I probably won't know for another three
weeks or so. I'm leaning towards the revamped RETURN TO ALBION storyline for a variety of
reasons, but I haven't ruled out following up with THE CHOSEN ONE either. Everything is a tough
call, as we're doing our best to keep everyone interested in the book as much as possible while
attracting new readers at the same time.

<p>Unless everyone pitches in and does their part, six months from now might not even matter. I,
however, can't afford to take that attitude. My reasons for hoping is that Marvel has had trouble with a
few titles lately that were either about to be cancelled or just cancelled, only to see reader support
bring them back from the dead. KNUCKLES isn't that far gone yet, but it could be if everyone sees
nothing but doom and gloom.

<p>If anyone wants the straight facts, just ask me. If you don't hear news from an official source, such as
myself or Justin, then anything passed along is just a rumor until it is verified. We don't need bad
speculations to be accepted as gospel truth.</i>
<p>Looks like Manny's Star Wars crossover will get pushed back as well (or axed).

Ken Penders yesterday commented on what will happen to Knuckles now that the book is going bi-monthly:
<p><i>As of now, it may be going bi-monthly as of issue #35, but that doesn't mean we're going down
without a fight. Because of circumstances, we will be retooling things a bit in order to make the
series more accessible for new readers to jump on, as well as give those Sonic readers who haven't
read the book an incentive to try. Issue #35 features a book length adventure that'll thrill and stun
everyone by the time it's over. Even Justin was bowled over when he read what I came up with. 

<p>While #35 heralds the beginning of a major crossroad for everyone's favorite echidna, #36 opens the
door to something new and different, as the KNUCKLES back-up stories go on hiatus for awhile as
we debut a new series based on another Sega game. Every issue will see a six page story written
by yours truly with art by none other than Spaz! That's right. This will be his first regular series of
stories, as opposed to covers, and anything goes. If sales do increase, not only could KNUCKLES
be restored to monthly status, but there's a chance of a spin-off depending upon reaction. More
information will be forthcoming once I have all the details, as we're busy figuring them out ourselves.
Take care. </i>

A very interesting topic came up on the Sonic Newsgroup, how did Uncle Chuck eat a chil1 dog in the episode of "Spyhog" in the SatAM cartoon? Here's what Ben Hurst, writer of the cartoon, said in response:
<p><i>Actually, the roboticizer converts the limbs and outer portions of the body - but
                    leaves the central core organs and the brain in organic form, albeit severely
                    restricted in free will.  A poignant moment was when Uncle Chuck disclosed
                    that those who were roboticized were still able to know what was happening to
                    them, a particularly wicked form of torture "added" to the roboticizer program
                    by Julian/Robotnik.  In another episode, Sonic discovers the area of
                    Robotnik's HQ where the organic "glop" is being prepared for the roboticized
                    citizens.  So...Uncle Chuck might indeed be able to eat a chili dog, but it
                    could give him gastrointestinal distress.</i>
<p>Hmmm...ok. Remember this only applies to the SatAM cartoon, not Archie. But we'll be sure to throw this at the Archie staff at the upcoming San Diego Comic Con '99, which we will cover to the fullest extent.

This below is an editorial from <a href="http://sages.ign.com">Gaming-Sages</a>, a site of Imagine Games Network.
<p><i>Sonic the Hedgehog:
Six years ago, in the midst of the peak of SEGA's American success with
the 
Genesis, the company licensed out the Sonic family of characters to
Archie 
Comics.  Archie Comics, best known for their comic books featuring
Archie, 
Jughead, Betty, Veronica, and the rest of the gang, were at the time
also 
publishing comics based on the waning sensation of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja 
Turtles.  With two successful licenses on their hands, the Archie
Adventure 
Series imprint was created, and a dynasty was born.

<p>Tragedy soon struck: the cancellation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles 
animated series the next year left sales of that book and its companion
series (featuring "the Mutanimals") in the dirt, and they were both 
cancelled. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG alone remained, mysteriously achieving
success 
despite SEGA's waning market presence or the appearance of any new
Sonic 
video games.

<p>Two years ago, still under the Archie Adventure Series imprint, after
several 
mini-series and guest-appearances, a spin-off was launched, starring
"Sonic's 
friendly nemesis."  The book, KNUCKLES THE ECHIDNA was not as
successful as 
its parent titles, but was still a smash.  Shortly thereafter, the
specials 
that Archie had been publishing featuring Sonic were given an official 
numbering, and the quarterly, double-sized SONIC SUPER SPECIAL series
was 
born.

<p>Now with three successful titles featuring SEGA characters under its
belt, 
Archie began to look elsewhere in the SEGA library of characters for
new 
books to publish.  Up came NiGHTS, whose game on the Saturn was one of
the 
32-bit machine's few successes.  Originally planned as a three-issue 
mini-series, it was soon extended for another three issues.
Unfortunately, 
these next three issues didn't sell very well and the series was
cancelled, 
leaving Archie once again with the Sonic family, and that alone.

<p>Currently, SONIC THE HEDGEHOG comics are outselling traditional
industry 
favorite UNCANNY X-MEN almost on a 2 to 1 basis (from the 1997-1998 
publishing year statistics). With the return of both SEGA and Sonic to 
American shores this September with the Dreamcast and Sonic Adventure,
it 
would seem that the comics' sales should skyrocket, extending that
margin 
even further. </i>
<p>Glad to see some industry people actually seeing the success of the Sonic comic. The comic industry itself is also starting to take notice of the Sonic comic, an indication would be the rising sales in the direct market sector.
