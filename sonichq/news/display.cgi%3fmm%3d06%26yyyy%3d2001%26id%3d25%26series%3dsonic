<b>VERY Wild SA2 Rumor</b> - Vector 17:23 pm 06-29-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Supposedly, if you get all 180 emblems in SA2, a secret area opens up, loaded with cool extras.  Also, according to this rumor, there IS a point to all the hidden Bigs in the game.  This area sounds too good to be true, but after the other stuff that's been revealed about SA2, it wouldn't really surprise me too much if it was in there.  If it is, then kudos to Sonic Team for putting something like this intro the game for the 10th anniversary.  This is a mild spoiler, since you may want to be surprised by what you get when you get 180 emblems, so it's listed in a link.<p><i>You get onto the island which looks A LOT like green Hill, its a pretty straight forward path. you walk forward with the Green Hill music playing until you get to a Lake where BIG the Cat is fishing. Once you walk up to him he says that he has been seeing you and your friends all over for the past couple of days. He asks why he wasn't invited and Sonic makes up some poor excuse. BIG then says he has something for you but first you need to take a little quiz. He asks you various questions about where he is in each level. There is 30 questions, you get one ring for each one you get right. After this you say goodbye and he continues fishing. You continue along the path untill you you get to three doors, one door has a sign that says 10 rings, the other says 20 rings, and the last one says 30 rings. Inside the 10 rings door is Sonic's Brithday party, it has Character from every sonic game ever made. It's a FMV, but once its done you get a little section with 5 Mini games, which are beaten and then unlocked for use in Multiplayer The 20 ring door Has big bithday present box, Sonic's voice comes on and says that it is a special present for you for 10 years of great times, Spindash it open and out pops and it unlocks a section in extra Menu called "Classic Hedgehog" It has the Entire Green Hill level and a few levels from the other Sonic, all with slightly improved Genesis graphics. I dont know what is in the 30 rings door yet, becuase the final question BIG gives you are very hard, or so they say. If you know the answers tell me them. Question 30) How Many Times did you see me. There are no choices for this, you need to put in a numeric value. Thats the hard part, we need to find out how many times Big appears in the game, its not the number of levels, That was tried and it didn't work.</i>  <p>Source: TSSZ

<hr>
<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
<hr>
