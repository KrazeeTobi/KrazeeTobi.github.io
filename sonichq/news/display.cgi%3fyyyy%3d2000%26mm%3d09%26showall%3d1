<div class=itemtext>
This is just an addendum to the article Knuckles posted about the "Day 9" pictures of Sonic Adventure. I just wanted to point out about the second picture, that looks like the Chao Doctor (with a different look than the SA Homepage), this time integrated in-game (possible for Chao Tutorials and Troubleshooting.) I mean, come on, hospital beds, a medical symbol slapped everywhere, "doctor" hair stuck on an otherwise normal Chao. (to distinguish it from one you grow, to make it recognizable to a normal player as a regular character.) Just thought I'd point that out, thanks.<br>

<b>Dreamcast Piracy Finally Dying Down?</b> - Jinsoku 22:15 pm 09-24-00

<div class=itemtext>
Upon my regular visit to <a href="http://www.dcwarez.com" target="_blank">www.dcwarez.com</a>, my jaw dropped as I noticed that all the goodies of information of upcomming released pirated games were, well, gone. The front page was only left with this message:<p>  <i>"Due to legal issues, www.dcwarez.com is suspended until further notice. However, a full statement will be issued regarding the future of this site in several days."</i><p>  Well slap me silly and call me a raving lunatic on drugs; SEGA has gotten to the second best "DC Scene" site on the web. However, one question pops up to everyones minds;<p>  Why?<p>  If anyone who visited www.dcwarez.com would know, they didn't contain any material which would be illegal in SEGA's eyes. No game covers, no illegal Dreamcast boot disk, no links to places to get the ripped games, nothing. All they really had was information on the next upcoming games that were ripped by the groups of DC hackers, and nothing more. Therefore, why is SEGA attempting to shut dcwarez.com down?<p>  I'm not clear on the whole legal issues, but I'm sure what SEGA is doing is wrong. Nevertheless, it's still good to see that they're stomping down and setting the line to people out there who are attempting to release more pirated games online, and saying, "No more." Yet, will this be enough to stop it?<p>  Not a chance. More and more sites pop up at least every week or so about the whole "DC Scene." Rest assured, the piracy of Dreamcast games will go on, but at least SEGA is trying their best to rid of it all.<br>

<b>Interesting Sonic/Knuckles Info From Ken Penders</b> - Double&#8225;Cross 21:32 pm 09-23-00

<div class=itemtext>
 <br>This comes straight from Ken's MB:  <br><br><i>Are you taking a deep breath, Rick? Better sit down, as I  announce that the story THE CHOSEN ONE is now on the  schedule. Regretably, it won't be the 66-page epic  originally planned, but it was either do it in 24 or  nothing, so I accepted the conditions and put it on track.  The storyline will see print in SONIC #94 - 96, followed by  the return of the Dark Legion in SONIC #97 - 99, which leads  into the SONIC/KNUCKLES crossover in #100. Look for the  return of Dimitri as Enerjak, as well as other surprises.  <br><br>As for SONIC #100, discussions have begun on what the story  will be like, and this much I can say: it'll be a  full-length story featuring practically every character we  can shove in there, it'll be written by both Karl and  myself, and I'll probably be handling some of the art, but  not sure what or how much just yet.  <br><br>What it won't have: any weddings or engagements involving  anyone from Knothole Village. Justin, Karl and I have been  discussing the issue at length, and it was decided that  most, if not all of the characters considered -- Sonic,  Sally, Antoine, and Bunnie -- are simply too young for any  serious relationships beyond simply dating. (I had been a  proponent for at least Antoine and Bunnie getting engaged,  but I'm afraid that is one aspect where I simply may have  let all the fan interaction get to me, and just wanted that  monkey off my back. You have no idea how tiring it gets to  receive e-mail practically every day asking when Sonic and  Sally are going to get married. When Justin and karl made  their case against it, I couldn't help but agree. It would  be wrong for the series to proceed any further in that  direction at this time.)  <br><br>I'll have much more to say at my online chat. See you there.</i>  <br><br>This info <u>REALLY</u> clears up a lot of questions from fans regarding the comic.

I don't think anyone else has noticed this, but in the new screen shots from Sonic Adventure 2, in the one where Sonic is jumping out of the helicopter, there is a pair of handcuffs attached to one of his wrists. (the one on the right side of the picture.)  Now, considering we know that there is some kind of a dark or evil Sonic in this game, this pretty much confirms that at some point, Sonic will be framed and arrested, then escape.  The helicopter could be a police copter, and maybe GUN stands for some kind of made up law agency in the game. <br>

<b>And The Heavens Cried.....ARTOON ?!?!!</b> - WB 11:02 am 09-22-00

<div class=itemtext>
Meet Pinobee.  <p>About a year ago at this time, there were a million wicked rumors circulating about Sonic Team, ranging from the unlikely (Sonic Team splits into three divisions: the Naka division, the Ohshima division, and the Iizuka division) to the unearthly (Sonic Team breaks up). But as with any rumor, it all stems from a (usually) harmless truth, and the truth in this scenario is that a number of key Sonic Team players left Sega to form their own development house: Artoon.      <img src=http://www.sonicnext.com/games/misc/pino_2.gif align=right><p>Green Gibbon (who originally revealed this) isn't sure at this point exactly which members of the Team defected during the upheaval, but the big word going around is that Naoto Ohshima is among the list of traitors. Actually, it kind of makes sense. Ohshima's style of direction is very mellow and fantasy-based, but the recent Team trend is towards off-the-wall, "wacky-cool" styles ala Samba De Amigo. It's not hard to predict just what we can expect from Artoon...think along the lines of Sonic CD and Ristar, both of which were made by certain members of Sonic Team.   <img src=http://www.sonicnext.com/games/misc/pino_1.gif align=right><p>Artoon's first independent project, Pinobee: Quest of Heart for the Game Boy Advance, ideally reflects the sense of fantasy direction found in the aforementioned titles (as well as <b>NiGHTS</b>). Players control Pinobee, a robotic bee who dreams of becoming real. (The name is actually a play on "Pinocchio.") Apparently, it's an action platformer with luscious hand-painted backgrounds and rendered characters. Pinobee: Quest of Heart is being published in Japan by Hudson. Other titles from Artoon include a couple of cell phone games not really worth mentioning, but if you absolutely must know about them, you can read all the gunky details <a href=http://www.artoon.co.jp target="_whole">here (in Japanese, of course). </a>  <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://www.theghz.com/ target="_whole">Neo Green Hill Zone </a> <br>

<img src=mariosonic.jpg align=right>Microsoft has started the hype machine yet again to plug their upcoming videogame console, the X-box, with a press conference showing off 3rd-Party support for the console in a conference in San Francisco, London and Tokyo. To help kick the announcement off, Microsoft also showed off a demo reel of numerous titles headed towards the console, including a curious platformer that looks an <b>awful lot</b> like a hedgehog we know and love. After seeing the footage, it became obvious that the spikey lookalike was not Sonic, but just to help cut off the rumor mill on UseNet before it even gets started, IGN DC contacted Sega for the official word on the identity of this masked hop-aholic. Heather Hawkins, Manager of Gaming Press Relations for Sega of America stated, "That is not Sonic. Sure looks like him, though. There are no plans whatsoever to release a Sonic title on X-box."  <p>So sorry, kids. Much like the rumor of Nintendo and Sega co-developing an RPG, this one is obviously a heap of bunk. As for the true identity of the title, no one knows who this Sonic wanna-be is, but rest assured that we'll keep an eye out for the guilty party should he pop up again.    <p>As far as that Sonic/Mario RPG. Its been conflicting as to whether its valid or not everywhere, which it probably isnt (Ages and Odnetnin? Really now. ^___^) So no one knows for sure even though its one of the biggest whoppers I've seen. ^_^ But it certainly is fun to imagine what it WOULD be if it is.

<p><img src="http://www.segasonic.net/rlan/monkey.jpg" align="left">The Samba De Amigo v.2000 Upgrade has been shown at the JAMMA Show, Including new modes and songs, and surprisingly, THIS NEW MONKEY GIRL! (which I'd bet alot of money for, that shes in because of the Love Love Mode, You Go Amigo!)</p>  <p><em>Heres whats new with ver. 2000: a bunch of new songs have been added into the mix (along with the original games selection of Samba melodies), and there are two new modes available from the select menu. The first new gameplay mode is Normal Mode (the default system for the sequel), which introduces the practice of waving both maracas between two of the six positions. Youll also need to make wide, circular sweeping motions with both maracas. Whenever youre required to do this, the pose icon pops up, and voices start chanting. This does an exceptional job of making the player look even sillier, and it gets my seal of approval. </em></p>  <p><em>The other addition is the Dreamcast versions notorious Love-Love Mode, which calculates the romantic compatibility between two players. This is specifically designed for young couples who frequent game centers (which are hot Tokyo dating spots  really!), and is appallingly cute. To increase the games red-hot sexual tension, a new character has been dropped in  a lovely girl monkey who plays the tambourine. Rrrowr. </em></p>  <p><em>And thats about it. Ver. 2000 isnt particularly earth-shattering, but the new songs and the maraca-waving challenges are fun enough to warrant getting addicted all over again  and I had a blast playing it at the show. Lets hope that this paves the road for future, fruitier endeavors from Sonic Team.</em></p>  <p>There are movies and pictures, go check the source!</p>  <p>Source: <a href="http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/25307.html">DC.IGN.COM</a></p><br>

The Sequal (Technically) To Samba De Amigo! However, instead of Maracas, we've got Tamborines instead, and a buncha of new characters!</p>  <p><em>Using a similar arcade cabinet, the gameplay is oddly reminiscent of Samba de Amigo, requiring you to shake a single tambourine in one of six positions. Colored dots show you where to shake, and where to smack the bright, yellow button located on both sides of the musical peripheral to make a clapping sound. Since the arcade games sensors are capable of tracking the maraca in 3D space, youll also be required to make circular, sweeping motions with the maraca while shaking it (similar to painting graffiti in Jet Set Radio). Is it fun? Yes. Oh, hell, yes. If you dont move your butt to this game, theres something seriously wrong with you. </em></p>  <p><em>The music threw us for a loop at first  instead of the funky Latin beats of Samba, Shakkas tunes are all J-Pop songs from Nipponese super groups like Morning Musume and Ayumi Hamazaki. Ranging from traditional Japanese melodies to fast-paced techno, the song selection is great if youre Japanese. If Segas considering an American release, 99% of these songs are gonna get the axe (though I hope they leave in the Gatchaman theme). </em></p>  <p><em>Shakka appears to use the same engine as Samba, sporting 60fps, cartoony visuals with stoopid-crazy amounts of background animation. And oo-wee, is it fruity! Seriously, this is one of the brightest, shiniest, happiest games weve seen since Super Magnetic Niu-Niu. Think the dancing monkeys in Samba de Amigo were weird-ass creations? They aint nothin compared to the white tuxedo-clad freaks who smile insanely as they shake their tambourines in a fit of ecstasy. These guys scare me.</em></p>  <p>There are movies Avaliable at the source, check them NOW!</p>  <p>Source: <a href="http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/25306.html">DC.IGN.COM</a></p><br>

<b>The Sega Gamecube?</b> - WB 9:24 am 09-12-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Believe it or not - Gamecube was the name that was supposed to have been Dreamcast! ;)  <p>Yuji Naka posts a column to Sonic Team's web page every now and then (see previous and below articles), and the latest entry contains an interesting revelation. Apparently, when Sega was deciding upon the name for its new 128-bit console, Sonic Team looked at the shape of the system and suggested "G-Cube." If Sega had taken Sonic Team's advice, we may just have ended up with the Sega G-Cube instead of the Sega Dreamcast. Hmm&#8230; perhaps Nintendo would have then opted to release the Nintendo Dreamcast?  <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com/ target="_whole">IGN DC</a>  <br>

<b>From The Translated Diary Of Yuji Naka</b> - WB 8:44 am 09-12-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<p>Yuki Naka has put some interesting material on the Sonic Team website. ^_^ One of which is new pictures of the Sonic Store in Nagoya, Japan. :)  <p><center><table border=0> <tr><td> <img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/shop/shop7.jpg> </td><td> <img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/shop/shop4.jpg> </td></tr> <tr><td> <img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/shop/shop5.jpg> </td><td> <img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/shop/shop6.jpg> </td></tr> </table></center>  <p>I've managed to find a way to translate some of the stuff he has on the page. (Yes, I've found a way to reliably translate some Japanese now. YAY! ^__^) And one of the other entries from his "web diary" (see article above) talks about the recording session for Sonic Adventure 2. One of things said is that a new character has been confirmed! ^__^ He talks about something that was called a "Volume of Post Recording" on Sonic Adventure 2. The translation is a bit wacky in areas and _VERY_ hard to follow (I believe its due to errors in grammar during translation), but here's what it got translated to:  <img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/studio/0801_1.jpg align=right><p><i>[It] had gone to the studio of a Touhoku new company in Akasaka for the audition of a new character etc. of 'Sonic adventure 2'on this day. It is anxious because [it] thinks as going, and it is not done to SCE separately that it is bad whenever the studio in this Akasaka is in the vicinity of SCE whenever [it] goes. (^_^;) Video production for the Tokyo game show of '(*fantashestaronrain*)'was the vicinity of SCE. &#8218;é&#8218;Ì&#8218;à&#8218;¢&#8218;¢&#8218;à&#8218;ñ&#8218;¾&#8218;È [ has been reconsidered in the studio because there was no audition recently. </i>  <p>I said the thing was wacky - I didn't say it was legible :P <p>Remember these pictures below? I've managed to get a lot of different stuff translated and its REALLY cool. ^^ One of the things (concerning an article that was posted a few months ago) was concerning the "Pokemon Train" where people were wondering why Mr. Naka had pictures of Pokemon on the ST website. It turns out that this entry of the diary was comparing Pokemon's train advertisements to the Sonic Adventure train advertisements before its launch. And he mentioned how the SA advertisement campaign was much smaller than how Pokemon is being advertised.   <p><center><table border=0> <tr><td> <p><img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/train/train04.jpg> </td><td> <img src=http://www.sonicteam.com/fromteam/train/soni1.gif>   </td></tr> </table></center> <p>I'll be going through my translator pretty much half the day.

<b>Sega Cracking Down on the Piracy</b> - Jinsoku 3:02 am 09-10-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<b>Some serious news</b> involving the whole piracy of Sega Dreamcast games has been brought up.<p>  Sega is taking no prisoners this time, and has now officially shut down one of the <b>largest</b> Dreamcast sites out there that contains the most information on how to copy your own DC games and everything. The site? <a href="http://www.dcisos.com">www.dcisos.com</a>.<p>  This site was totally into the whole "DC Scene," as the whole Dreamcast piracy business was called. This site explained on how to burn your own DC games, contained the files to make your Dreamcast work with copies. It also contained covers to the DC games for those that wanted their copies nice and neat. They even contained <i>manuals</i> in Adobe format, not to mention a forum where people could discuss things that were going well, or things that screwed up and warn people not to obtain certain things. All to keep the scene going.<p>  Yet, since it didn't contain any files that illegally distributed any actual DC games, there was no way Sega could touch them, seeing as all they did was give out information. Apparently, something caught Sega's eyes and soon hacked down on their site, which will truly slow down the distribution, however, not by a long shot. There are other websites out there that focus on the whole DC Scene, basically replicas of DC ISOS, and this won't stop broadband users with CD Burner's from getting more games.  In other news, last week, Kalisto, a major online  distributor of the DC games released their latest, and final, DC game to the public, and with it, they had this to say:<p>  <i>"Sega has offered us stock options to stop releasing DC, so this will be it, our last release."</i><p>  Sega had found a new piracy protection code for it all to end. Kalisto, however, found their way around it and ripped their last few games to the public.<p>  Rumor's have it that Sega was devistated that no matter what, Kalisto would always get through the protection code, and it scared Sega. So, they offered them a way to "shut their mouths" and basically bribed them. Another rumor is that they were caught and arrested, and that they used that bit to cover up what really happened.<p>  It seems Sega's finally gaining the upperhand on the piracy business, but with more groups showing up to distribute games online, there's no telling when it will all end. One thing's for sure, Sega's much more ordered than Sony when it comes to piracy.<br>

<b>Sega Scream If You Love Sonic!</b> - WB 2:44 am 09-09-00

<div class=itemtext>
<img src=scream.jpg align=right><p>Stop thinking and SCREAM !!! Ladies And gents - the Sega Scream that defined Sega in the early 90's is officially back! And with it comes a new commercial that features a guest stint of not only Tails, but E-102 Gamma as well! ^___^  <p>Sega recently announced the introduction of a multi-million dollar advertising and marketing campaign to support the launch of Sega.com's much-anticipated SegaNet, the only high-speed online console gaming network providing Sega Dreamcast and PC users with the ultimate in speed, reliability and content. The campaign, which includes one 60-second TV spot and two 30-second spots, was created by Foote, Cone & Belding, San Francisco and includes animated footage from Pacific Data Images, the creators of the award-winning animated feature film, Antz. ^___^ To kick off the campaign, Sega debuted the commercials on September 7th during the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.  <p>The Play Online advertisement features the Sega characters whistling &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; while an announcer speaks about &#8220;whipping each other&#8217;s booty&#8221; using SegaNet. Kids are shown throwing their controllers around, screaming, tearing up teddy bears (no joke) and even blowing up their houses after competing in some fierce NFL2K1, NBA2K1, and Quake III. All this is highlighted by the Sega Scream, which is done in true oldschool Sega style. Those with VERY sharp eyes can pick up characters from Power Stone, Resident Evil, Fur Fighters, and Amigo from Sonic Teams Samba De Amigo - but most importantly Tails The Fox and E-102 Gamma From Sonic Adventure! Can you spot them in the picture above? ^__^  <p><b>Download The Commercial:</b> <a href=http://dcmovies.ign.com/media/news2/video/segaad/PlayOnline.mpg>"Play Online!" - 25337K</a> <br><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://www.dimension-s.com/>Dimension S</a> And <a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com/>IGN</a>  <br>

The press release is below. :)  <p>As part of Emulation Zone's on going commitment to the emulation scene and to video gamers alike, we are proud to announce <a href=http://www.emulinks.com>EmuLinks.Com</a> . The goal of this new web site is to pick-up where many search engines, like Yahoo, leave off by offering a complete database of links geared toward emulation and video gaming. Since it's coded, owned and operated by us, a non-profit organization, you can be sure that we will strive to offer our viewers an unbiased  service they can depend on.  <p>What makes our site unique from many "link sites" on the web is that our site is completely automated. This allows us to do things to our database of links unimaginable or too difficult to incorporate on site that are edited by hand, such as real time user feedback.  <p>The site is currently in its final beta testing phases, but just about all the bugs have been ironed out. I would like to cordially invite everyone with a related web site to on stop on by and <a href=" http://www.emulinks.com/v1.0/submit_create.php3">submit</a> a link to your site. Our team of reviewers will go through the link submission and review the sites accordingly.   <p>If you don't have a web site, we would like to welcome the public to play around with the site, add links to their favorite related home pages and give feedback on what they think of the place. :)   <br>

<b>Sonic #92 - Preview Spoilers: Guess Who?</b> - WB 6:07 am 09-08-00

<div class=itemtext>
Dub here! Its _SUPER_ late my time and the Sonic #92 Spoilers are just in - and it looks like the return of a love him or hate him character. But <u>THIS TIME</u> - another writer and another artist are handling the chores....  <p><hr>Sonic The Hedgehog #92 <br>"The Wrath of Khan"  <br>"Bagging The Big One" <br>Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders <br>Art by James Fry and Steven Butler <br>Inks By Andrew Pepoy and Pam Eklund.  <br> <br>The Wrath Of Khan! Monkey Khan, that is. The cyborg-simian created by Doctor Robotnik returns, and this time the furry fury's got it in for his maker and all Overlanders in general. In an ironic twist, Sonic goes from protecting the newly arrived Overlanders from the Eggman last issue, to defending them against Monkey Khan this issue! If he doesn't they might go running scared into Robotnik's clutches after all. And in the backstory, "Bagging The Big One," As his search for the Floating Island continues, Knuckles discovers he's the quarry of more than a few interested parties, each racing to beat the other. Unfortunately for them, this isn't the Knuckles they've all dealt with before...  <br> <br>32 pages, $1.99, ships on Dec. 22.  <p><hr> Eh. Looks to be somewhat decent - but then again I'm not a big fan of the Amazing Jackie Chan Chimpanzee either. :P  Whenever he's been around its always been under the pen of Frank Strom. For once its Karl Bollers and since James Fry is handling artwork there is SOME hope. :)  <p>8 Issues From This One Till The Big Double Zero!!! ^___^  <br>

<hr>
<font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog Advance</b> - The <u>first</u> Segasonic videogame on a Nintendo system - has been confirmed for the Game Boy Advance.</font> The game is reported to be along the lines of the Genesis 2D sidescroller, featuring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, with brand new levels unique to the Nintendo system. The game is currently scheduled for a worldwide release with the US system this July. Also confirmed have been "Puyo Puyo" and Sonic Team's "Chu Chu Rocket".
<hr>
<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
<hr>
<font color=red>Sega has confirmed that it is stopping production on all Dreamcasts and will be moving on to develop for other systems.</font> Theres a _LOT_ to this story and if you wish to learn more you can read the reprinted article and discuss your opinions on the situation at The Station Square Newsboard. The link to the full story & discussion can be found <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fsonichqcommunitystationsquarenewsandeditorials.showMessage?topicID=181.topic>here.</a>

<font color=red>The landmark 100th issue of Archie Comic's "Sonic The Hedgehog" will be out, August 2001.</font> Titled "Darkness Falls", one of the main characters - a good guy - will go bad and become the "Ultimate Villian". The preview cover of Sonic #100 suggests it's Knuckles, but it MAY be a fake cover.
<hr>
Reasaurus Toys are currently in the process of making thier <font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog - Series 3 Toy Line</font>. Characters will come from Sonic Adventure 2 and will consist of Sonic, Shadow, and Rouge. No other figures or a release date is known at this time.
