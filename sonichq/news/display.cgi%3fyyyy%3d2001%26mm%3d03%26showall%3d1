<b>Microsoft and Sega Team Up?!?!?</b> - Metal Sonic 18:31 pm 03-28-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
This is of ign.com if you want to see!(and my first post) <p> Sega and Microsoft To Team Up? <p> You say the Xbox has no good games? It seems an old friend might have something to say about that. <p> March 26, 2001  <p>  If the startling silence of GDC is any indication, Microsoft has more than a few major announcements up their sleeve, and while most are anticipating more launch details and information on Team Xbox's Network Strategy, the unveiling of multiple 3rd party developers will undoubtedly take center stage among enthusiast gamers. To that end, IGN Xbox has learned that one of the primary partners for Microsoft's new console will be none other than the newly platform-agnostic crew at Sega. While details are scarce at best, rumor has it that this newly-made 3rd party giant is about to strut its stuff in a big way, revealing a horde of titles that will be joining the Xbox software line-up. <p>  While no specifics are available at present, rumors about the company's sports franchises making the leap to multiple platforms have already hit the web, and IGN Xbox has also heard that the Bill Gates Keynote will include some surprises. What surprises? Well, while no specifics were given, apparently the list will include several obvious franchises, as well as the return of an old favorite. Hmmmm. <p>  When asked for comment on a pending announcement, Sega's Vice president of Corporate and Marketing Communications Charles Bellfield stated, "Sega continues negotiating with all platform companies as we announced on January 31st. We look forward to making announcements shortly, but at this point, Sega has no further information." <p>  Microsoft's Xbox Director of Advanced Technology Seamus Blackley hinted of big things to come at Tokyo Game Show 2001Spring during his speech at this year's Game Developer's Conference, and if what we hear is true, this could be one of the biggest. Unfortunately, we were unable to unearth any specifics as to the exact titles that will be revealed, but an announcement is expected to kick off the show Friday morning in Tokyo, so be sure to check back with IGN Xbox late Thursday evening for full details.  <br>

<b>The webmaster for the Samurai Pizza Cats website "Princess Vi's 'Spiffy-Diffy' SPC Page" gives Sonic some support  </b> - Ronickles 16:36 pm 03-28-01

<div class=itemtext>
       I had sent an E-mail to this Samurai Pizza Cats website where I asked the question Who do you think is the cooler videogame mascot between Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog?" and her answer was Sonic the Hedgehog. I don't know if this could lead to cross-fandom support, but I'd say it would be a great idea of SPC fans and StH fans coming together for a massive fan crossover event, even if it lasted just a little while.<br>

<div class=itemtext>
Basically it's the same as the previous Sonic #98 spoilers, but some other information is given. <p> <a href="http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0103/19/sonic99.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0103/19/sonic99th.jpg" alt="Sonic #99 preview cover" align=left border=1></a> Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders, art by James Fry, Ron Lim and Penders. <p> "Blow By Blow" After returning to Knothole, Geoffrey informs Elias that Robotnik still has robotization on his mind. Sally disguises herself as a servant and manages to sneak out of Castle Acorn in order to go see Sonic, but Sonic has his hands full trying to stay incognito while he continues his quest for Arachnis and the Sword - not to mention Mina, Sally's latest rival for Sonic's affections. The intrigue never ends where Kodos, Doctor Quack, Tails, Nate, Elias and Knuckles all play a part. Plus, another Knuckles back-up story, this time guest-starring Sonic's buddy Tails. <p> 32 pages, $1.99, arrives in stores on June 29. <p> Source: <a href="http://www.comicscontinuum.com/" target="_blank">Comics Continuum</a> <p> Note: The information on the back-up is wrong since "Chosen One" arc ends in Sonic #97 and the back-up in Sonic #99 is going to be a story called "What Goes Around Comes Around!" which will mark the return of Julie-Su and the Dark Legion.<br>

<div class=itemtext>
This just in! <P><I>TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Sega Corp said that its outspoken president Isao Okawa, who recently grabbed media headlines for his 85 billion yen ($695.7 million) private donation to the struggling gamemaker, died of heart failure on Friday. He was 74 years old.<P>  When Sega made the tough decision of ending its flagship Dreamcast game console in January, Okawa took the unprecedented step of making the donation to ease its pain. <P> Okawa returned his entire stakes in Sega and other group firms -- CSK Corp , Ascii Corp , and NextCom KK -- to offset some of Sega's financial burden from its January 31 decision to pull the plug on its loss-making game machine by end-March. <P>  The gift, also involving shares in unlisted firms and convertible bonds, helped calm nervous investors about the outlook for the world's third biggest gamemaker as it faced 80 billion yen in special losses from ending Dreamcast, leading to a record 58.3 billion yen net loss in the year to March. <P>  Okawa also was founder and honorary chairman of information services company CSK and had been active in helping Sega and software publisher Ascii expand their networking businesses.</I><P>Aw....man......this is terrible.<P><B>SOURCE:</B> <A href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010316/t6091.html">Yahoo</A> <br>

In Sonic Shuffle, you can change Lumina into NiGHTS. I found this out from  the Technomania section of "Disney Adventures" (April 2001 issue):<P> <I>"Fool your friends by changing the character of Lumina the fairy into the Nights charatcer (star of the classic <B>Nights</B> game). To do it, go to your Dreamcast's Settings menu and change the date to Christmas Eve, 12/24/00. Then head back to the game and you'll have a whole new character. That's a Christmas present you can use year-round!"<I><P><B>Source:</B><I>Disney Adventures Magazine</I><br>

Reading through the latest <a href="http://www.nintendopower.com/">Nintendo Power</a> I stubled across an article about Sega developing for GBA (GameBoy Advance) and GCN (GameCube).

The titles anounced were ChuChu Rocket GBA ( or ChuChu Rocket Advance), Puyo Puyo, and Sonic Advance. No GCN titles were anounced.<br>

<hr>
<font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog Advance</b> - The <u>first</u> Segasonic videogame on a Nintendo system - has been confirmed for the Game Boy Advance.</font> The game is reported to be along the lines of the Genesis 2D sidescroller, featuring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, with brand new levels unique to the Nintendo system. The game is currently scheduled for a worldwide release with the US system this July. Also confirmed have been "Puyo Puyo" and Sonic Team's "Chu Chu Rocket".
<hr>
<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
<hr>
<font color=red>Sega has confirmed that it is stopping production on all Dreamcasts and will be moving on to develop for other systems.</font> Theres a _LOT_ to this story and if you wish to learn more you can read the reprinted article and discuss your opinions on the situation at The Station Square Newsboard. The link to the full story & discussion can be found <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fsonichqcommunitystationsquarenewsandeditorials.showMessage?topicID=181.topic>here.</a>

<font color=red>The landmark 100th issue of Archie Comic's "Sonic The Hedgehog" will be out, August 2001.</font> Titled "Darkness Falls", one of the main characters - a good guy - will go bad and become the "Ultimate Villian". The preview cover of Sonic #100 suggests it's Knuckles, but it MAY be a fake cover.
<hr>
Reasaurus Toys are currently in the process of making thier <font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog - Series 3 Toy Line</font>. Characters will come from Sonic Adventure 2 and will consist of Sonic, Shadow, and Rouge. No other figures or a release date is known at this time.
