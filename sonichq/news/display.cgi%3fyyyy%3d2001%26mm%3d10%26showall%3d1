Okay first let me say, if this guy is lying, I swear to God I will track him down and personally break his neck.  Ronald Mears sent me an email telling me he wrote a letter to DiC and got this reply:<br><br>  <i>Dear (email withheld by Sonique): <br><br>    <DD> We will be releasing episodes from the 1993 ABC series in February 2K2 on VHS and DVD. We will be releasing 2 episodes on VHS and 4 episodes on DVD (all 4 that are on the  VHS) We will not be releasing all 26 episodes at once but there is a possibility that we will release more episodes in 2002. I hope this answers your questions. Thank you for your continuing interest in Sonic the Hedgehog.<br><br>            Sincerely, <br><br>          Angela Rodgers, Marketing Director, DiC Entertainment"</i><br><br> Hopefully no one out there is that heartless to make this up, and if he is, may he die of a horrible disease worse than anthrax and be sent to Afganastan and used as target practice.  FYR I AM trying to get confirmation from DiC.<br>

<div class=itemtext>
This info comes from <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/0,10850,6013219,00.html" target="_blank">Gamespot</a>:<p>Sega has announced that it plans to implement a flat rate for consumers interested in playing networked games over the company's SegaNet online service. As of November 1, the company will charge $9.95 a month for unlimited access to Sega's online multiplayer games, as well as features such as instant messaging, profile pages, and organized online tournaments. Starting November 1, existing SegaNet customers will have to pay to access the service. The flat rate covers every online Sega game other than the original Phantasy Star Online, which the company said would still be available for free because it runs on its own servers.<p>As announced earlier, the SegaNet service will be rolled out across all upcoming and current platforms, including the Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo GameCube for online games. It will continue to support Dreamcast games. The SegaNet ISP service, which was originally introduced alongside the launch of the network, was discontinued in July.<p><i>Source: <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2819699,00.html" target="_blank">Gamespot</a></i><br>

Princess Sally, Knothole Village's first ambassador, is sent on her first mission as an envoy of peace to the rest of Mobius.

Before talks can commence, however, the Ancients ask the FF to help with a small problem they are having: a fire-breathing dragon. Plus: Knuckles in "Reunification, Part One." A mysterious echnida appears on the Floating Island. Rather than finding Knuckles, they find a place inhabited by The Dark Legion.
