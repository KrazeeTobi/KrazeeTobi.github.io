</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=3>#3. Mobodoon</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
It's the trio's birthday and they're on their way to find Mobodoon, a legendary "vanishing

</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

<a name=6>#6. Tangled Webs</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Sonic meets an old friend, Cyrus, who tells him his father is being kept as one of Robotnik's 
scientists. He does not tell him, however, that he's actually spying for Robotnik because of 
this. When he goes with the band to Sanctuary, a safe haven for all the Mobian children, he 
has to make the ultimate decision: sacrifice his father or reveal Sanctuary to Robotnik?<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=7>#7. The Deepest Fear</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Still on the trail of Queen Aleena, the crew arrive at Port Mobius, which turns out to be a 
village of Robotnik-worshippers. The reason for this is that Robotnik is protecting them from 
the legendary sea monster Mobideep, who had been sinking many ships in the past. Sonic must now face 
his fear of water or risk losing his siblings' lives...<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>

</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=10>#10. Come Out Wherever You Are</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

Sonic helps her in going there without being caught, but even more problems arise when Cyrus chooses her to fly the 
captives of the "Predator" to safety...<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=11>#11. Winner Fakes All!</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Robotnik has created a super-fast robot, and he's organised a race for the top athletes of Mobius

competition?<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=12>#12. A Hedgehog's Home Is Her Castle</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=13>#13. Artifacts</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
In order to make a lot of money, Robotnik sells artifacts to the nobility of Mobius. But these

</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=14>#14. Bug!</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
The band finds a village that has been destroyed by its Freedom Fighter occupants. Why has this 
happened? It seems to be something to do with the Flybots all over the desert, as Manic finds out 
when he's injected with a mind-control toxin...<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=14>#15. Sonic Tonic</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Using the essence of a rare plant, Robotnik manages to make Sleet and Dingo fast-- maybe even 
faster than Sonic. The Sonic Underground manage to get hold of it, but can Sonia and Manic resist 
the temptation of taking the drug themselves and being as fast as Sonic?<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=16>#16. Friend Or Foe?</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>

the Chaos Emerald...<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=17>#17. Head Games</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Queen Aleena sends her children over to Speedster Island, a place Bartleby is trying to turn into 
a holiday resort. Sleet and Dingo are pretending to help, but they just want to robotocise the 
islanders, who worship three stone heads that resemble Sonic, Sonia and Manic...<p>
</div><div class=titlebar><table class=glow>
<a name=18>#18. When In Rome...</a>
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
The hedgehogs are tiring of the war: every time they destroy a factory another two take its 
place. Feeling as if they're not making any difference, they seek The Oracle, who gives them a 
task: to go to the (Roman-style) dimension he created, and overthrow the current ruler (who bears 
an uncanny resemblance to Sleet) and restore peace -- all without their powers...<p>
