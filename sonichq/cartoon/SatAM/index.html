<p><center><b>Mobotropolis, Robotropolis, The Freedom Fighters, The Lake Of Rings, The Wolf Pack, The Doomsday Project, King Acorn, The Great War, The Robotnik Planetary Coup, Ixis Naugus - it all started here...
The Saturday AM version of the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon series introduced the Freedom Fighters to the world, and many often consider it the best of the two syndicated series. HOWEVER - it DOES have its drawbacks, as it tended to grossly 
deviate from the path of the games. It created a great cast that has lasted in Sonic history since its inception, but one of the biggest complaints was how Tails got shafted for Sally. Read the 3rd seaoson developments for more info...
It was a _great_ cartoon, but the fact that it was constantly up against Power Rangers while ABC moved its timeslot to keep it from competing with the dreaded show, along with ABC's idiotic "2 Seasons And You're Out" Standard - soon led to its cancellation on a cliffhanger no less. And most recently, The USA Network stopped showing reruns of the show, while Toon Disney shows only the kiddie Adventures version instead. 
Thus, it's hard to find copies if you've never seen it, so let us get you familiar with what began the whole thing....
