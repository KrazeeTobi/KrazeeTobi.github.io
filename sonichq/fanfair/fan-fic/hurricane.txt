  Hurricane  That  Never  Touched  the  Sea

In  a  twisted  land,
A  strong  wind  starts  blowing,
Growing,  growing,
Until  it  becomes  a  hurricane,
Not  of  wind  and  rain,
But  ideas  and   thoughts,
Schemes  and   plots,
The  eye  of  the  storm   grows,
The  principal  plan  that  rose
Out  of  conquest  and  destruction,
Abolition  of  peace,
And  always  in  motion.
The  evil   owner  of  this  twisted  land  keeps  the  storm  tearing,
Forbidding  its  wearing,
Strengthening  it,
Adding  to  it,
Never  letting  it  touch  the  sea,
It  is  quite  eerie,
For  though  the  hurricane  is  never  permitted  to  weaken,
Robotnik's   soul  is   destroyed  by  his  own  hurricane's   inability,
To  reach  the  calming  sea.
