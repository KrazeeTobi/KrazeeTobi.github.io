Island  Army     by  Blue9Tiger

Innumerable  machines  storm  his rocky  home
To  find only  trouble  at  his  door.
He  won't  stand  for  enemies  being  allowed  to  roam
Through  his  walls and  under  his  floor.
Instead  of  calling  for  his  allies
To  help  him  ward  off  the  danger,
He'll  call  upon  his  strength  to  never  let  him  die;
Oh,  who  could  be  stranger?
Yet  his  power  is  not a  kind  seen  every  day.
It  is  a  rare  strength  that  never  seems  to  end.
He uses  it  to   keep  danger  at  bay,
Either  protecting  himself  or an  endangered friend.
His  fists  can  unleash  crushing blows,
Both  trees  and  opponents  fall  as  fast  as  stones.
What  he  may  lack  in  speed  or  brain,
He  compensates  by  inflicting  much  pain
On  whoever  who  decided  to  tangle  with  him
Whoever  decided  to  spill  his  temper  over  the  brim.
