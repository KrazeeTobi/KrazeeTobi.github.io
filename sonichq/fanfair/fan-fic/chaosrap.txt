                          The Chaotix Rap
By Espiogirl (Kelly Van)


Yo, we're da Chaotix,
We're brave and true,
We are six,
And one of you.

They call me Knuckles
'Cause I punch a lot,
You never see me chuckle,
When I punch out some 'bots.

I am Vector, da crocodile,
You can find me,
In da food aisle,
He's a lazy sack of potatoes you see!
Mighty!

Yo, I'm Espio,
I am fast,
I'm not slow
So I never came in last.
Ha! No one made fun of me!
Guess again, slow mo!
Mighty!

My name is Charmy Bee,
I do things my charming way,
And you could see,
I love to play!
And to par-tay!
Like your mom-may!
Mighty!

Mighty the Armadillo,
He is strong,
He's not soft as a pillow,
And he has a nose that's long!
Vector! Charmy! Espio!


I'm Julie-Su,
I really rule!
Mess with me,
I'll turn you into sushi!
