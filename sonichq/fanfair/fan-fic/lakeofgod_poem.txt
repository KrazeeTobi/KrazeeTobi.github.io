The  Lake  Of  Gold      by  Blue9Tiger

A  silent  pool  in  the  heart  of  a  wood,
Aiding  all  that  is  good.
It  appears  to  be  a  worthless  puddle  lying  there,
But  its  powers  would  raise  one's  hair.
It  stays  stagnant  and  quiet  until  it  is  ready,
Then  incredible  events  take  place  in  the  collected  eddies.
The crystal  blue  fades  into  a  brilliant  gold,
Defying  eyes  of  young  and  old. 
The  silent  waters  suddenly  wake,
Churning  and  twisting as  long  as  it  takes
To  release  a  power  beyond  comprehension,
To  form  an  object  drawing  so  much  attention.
The  lake  swirls  and  bubbles,
Its  blue  waters  in  huddles,
And  violently  erupts  into  a  whirlpool  of  muddles.
It  rises  to  the  nearest  tree,
Smiling  down  at  the  lake  bursting  with  glee.
And  when  the  water  aims  for  the  sky,
It  slowly  dies,
And  returns  to  a  smooth  sheet,
Failing  to  rise.
Before  it  does,
Only  few  know  the  cause,
Of  the glowing  golden  hoop  that  emerges  from  the  swirl,
Flying  and  floating  and  always  in  twirl,
Until  it  takes  one  course  or  the  other,
Either  it  lands  in  the  possession  of  someone,
Or  it  floats  back  to where  it  had  come  from.
This  mysterious  pool  only certain   Mobians  have  seen,
And  are  glad  they  were  born  where  it  had  been,
For  the ring  that  appears  from  the  lake
Allows  for  only   them  to  take
And  use  it  for  unimaginable  power,
By  finding  it  at  a  certain  hour.

Note:  No  explanation.  If  no  one  can  understand  this,  oh, 
well.
It  was  rhyming.  What's  there  to  understand?
Sorry  if  no  one  couldn't,  though.
