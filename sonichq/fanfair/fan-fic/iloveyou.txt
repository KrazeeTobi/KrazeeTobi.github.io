I love you, Sal, Sonic said
as he laid next to her and stroked her head
I never thought of this before
But when I'm with you, I love you more
You are the sunshine that lights my way
You are the bird that greets the day
You can't be replaced, Sally dear
So this statement you must hear:
Marry me, run away
I want to be with you in every way
Your father can banish us far from here
But I will do anything for you, my dear
Please say you love me, but if you don't
I'll understand in a way that you won't
Stay with me, Sal, my lover dear
I can praise you until you cannot hear

I love you, Sonic, Sal replied
As she lay against him and cried
I would be nothing without you
You're the one I say, it's true
You may be cocky, proud, and fast
But on my list, you're never last
I knew many men in my time
But you're the one that rings my chime
I love you, Sonic, let's run away
We will be married the informal way
We will have children who are fast
We will never tell them of our past
We'll leave our friends and family here
And get away, do you hear
I love you, Sonic, with all my heart
Nothing will ever tear us apart
