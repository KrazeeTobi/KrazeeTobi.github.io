	Cries For the Dead

     "Where have our children gone?" they wail.
     "Where have our children gone?
     No sign of paw nor quill nor fur.
     Where have our children gone?" 

     Little Rose has turned to metal,
     Mariam lies still in death, 
     Baby Kyle has disappeared,
     His parents' cries are wasted breath.

     To arms, to arms, Mobius!
     For our lost youngsters, slain. 
     Who told you that we can not fight,
     That we won't strike again? 

     Your putrid city we shall storm,
     And take back what is ours.
     We fear no bots nor laser blasts,
     For Freedom gives us power. 

     Return our children!
     Do you hear? 
     And if you have done them harm,
     You'll live with blood stains on your hands.

     MOBIUS! TO ARMS!
