MY NAME IS SALLY
By KiraLe

My name is Sally
Does it matter?
In this war
Titles mean not

My name is Sally
At least they think so
They don't know my real name
Overwhelmed

My name is Sally
I'm a princess
Am I a princess?
No

My name is Sally
I am a leader
My life is run
By politics

My name is Sally
Robotnik is gone
But trouble is not
Ixis has come

My name is freedom
Sally doesn't exist
She fell off a building
She never returned

My name doesn't matter
I live to serve
Or to be served
I do not know

My name is Queen
Elias he's come
His name is King
What am I?

My name is Hedgehog
I will marry Sonic
Daddy won't know
We'll elope

I cannot stay here
My name is Sally
My name means too much
Too much to bear
