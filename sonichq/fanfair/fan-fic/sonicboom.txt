The Sonic Boom

Plants rustle, winds blow,
Animals flee from terror unknown,
Birds of sky with feathers fair
Raise their beaks toward changing air.
Roaring sound emerging near,
Inspiring curiosity and fear.
Blazing streak comes racing by;
Air whooshing in to fill space behind.
In vicinity, creatures weak
Are immediately pulled off their feet.
Gazing animals catch a quick glance
And see a quilled creature racing away by chance.
They see blue fur with a startling shine
And red-white wheels with razor blade spines.
In the blink of an eye the image dances
Through the air, starting to vanish.
The faster animals see a look of concern,
Wondering where the sonic streak is to run.
The remembering ones see him head for Knothole,
A place where the stressed can rest their soul.
The smarter ones leave with a smirk,
Pitying the speed demon who must be irked.

A certain hedgehog is late for the bell
And a certain squirrel will kick his tail.
