(Inspired by "The Chaotix Rap" by Espiogirl, but I actually picked this up from SU episode 
"Mummy Dear")

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.

We're looking for a scroll, that belonged to some Egyptian.
It would be no problemo if I could just read these weird inscriptions!
I am fast, this is true. That's why they call me Sonic.
Nothing can stop me, not a SWATbot, nothing electronic!

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.

I maybe a surfer guy, and maybe I'm a dummy.
But it's not everyday I drum for dancing mummies.
I'm the drummer of this group, and they call me Manic.
But when you need a helping hand, I am the mechanic!

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.

My mother would be down here if I really had my brothers,
Especially with this prophet guy who looks just like my brother!
If you really want to know here, that Sonia is my name.
But unlike, what you think, I'm not that very vain.

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.

I am Hotheph, you are Hedgehogs, we know not each other.
But Rapsies would be watching me to help you find your mother.

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.

We are triplets, yes, that's true, royalty we are.
And we will make sure we will go very far!

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.

Dummies like Sleet and Dingo may be much like a dingbell,
But that tyrant Buttnik can just haul his butt to-

Hello once again, but sadly we must say, that we have to go.

That's okay, if I rap some more, I might just have to blow!

We are Sonic, Sonic Underground.
SONIC UNDERGROUND!
