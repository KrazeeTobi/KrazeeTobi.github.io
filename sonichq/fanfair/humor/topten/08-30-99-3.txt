By: SonicBoom13
 
10) 7 Chaos Emeralds/7 Dragon Balls. 
 9) Perfect Cell=Perfect Chaos 
8) Was that a Dragon Radar Zonic the Zonecop was holding in SSS#8 page 6 panel 5? 
7) Sonic and Goku's high speed running skills.   
6) With Sonic you got talking animals and humans, in DBZ you got the same thing!! (Example: Ulon (sp?), y'know the pig!!) 
5) Knuckles (not too mention any other guardian) can fight using energy. (OK, it's the emerald's power, but you get the idea!) 
4) Was that a saiyan (sp?) tail Sera (from the Sonic Anime) has? OK, some people argue that she's part cat, but those ain't ears!!!! Those are just oversized eyebrows!!!! 
3) Super-Sonic the Hedgehog/Goku the Super-Saiyan. 
2) Sonic has a long lost brother (Manic) just like Goku (Raditz, sp?)!!!! (In Sonic Underground and SSS#10!!!) 
1) And the #1 way Sonic and DBZ are alike is: Can you say Monkey Khan?

Hee hee, I'll be thinking up more for ya while I'm at it!!

Gotta juice! *whoosh===))*
