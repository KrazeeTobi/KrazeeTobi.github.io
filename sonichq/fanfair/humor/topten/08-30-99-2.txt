Top 10 reasons why Antoine should be a stand-up comedian:
by: Maric

This is Maric. I would like to contribute something for the top ten section.
This is my top ten list that I send it to the TSF about a year ago. I hope it is
still funny. Enjoy.

10) He's funny.
9) In the Robert Brown/Francis Tolber fanfics, he was a prankster.
8) He must've had been a weird kid.
7) He might have been the class clown in military school.
6) He might have gotten expelled from military school for perfoming Monty Python's "Military Faries" skit in the Drill ceremony.
5) He probably used to start his letters from camp with "Hello Mudda, Hello Fudda".
4) If you remember the Odd-ball/Robecca episode from the Sonic SATAM cartoon, you'll know why.
3) When he finally heard Sonic's middle name from 53, it gave him the chance to humulilate him.
2) Hey, if he's making people laugh in both the comic and the SATAM cartoon, he might as well make a living out of it.
1) He's Jim Carrey with fur.
