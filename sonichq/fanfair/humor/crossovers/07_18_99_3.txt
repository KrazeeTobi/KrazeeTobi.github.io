DC Comics / Sonic  - By Tim

Okay, It's a DC Comics Sonic crossover! All the super heros that 
would best fit. I just stuck in SatAM/Archie chars for the heck of it.

Sonic= Batman/Flash (He would fit better as Flash, but would be sooooo 
much cooler as Batman!)
Tails= Robin
Amy= Batgirl
Uncle Chuck= Alfred Pennyworth
Knuckles= Superman
Sally= Wonder Woman
Rotor= Steel
Robotnik= Lex Luthor
