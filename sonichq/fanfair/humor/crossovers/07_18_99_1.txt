Wild Wild West / Sonic   --  By Chuckie Chipmunk

Hehheh! I just came home from watching the movie 'Wild Wild West' 
with my father ((Beware the evil Theater popcorn)) and it was a 
kawaii movie! And when I got home, I immediatly thought up a crosscast! 
(wow, that was fast!)

Jim West - Sonic
Artimes Gordon - Tails
Rita - Sally
Dr. Loveless - Dr. Robotnik
General McGrath - Ixis Nagus
Girl in Water Tower - Bunnie
Loveless' three women - Kommistar, Julie-Su, and Torina (my character)
President - President from Sonic Anime
Rita's father/husband - King Acorn
Miss East - Sera ((Yeah, Sera isnt a bad guy, but I couldn't think of any 
                   other girl))
