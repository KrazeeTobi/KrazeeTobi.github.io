<b>Trouble in Sonic 3's Carnival Night Zone, Act 2</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
I can't get past one point in Sonic 3.  It's in the Carnival Night Zone, where you enter a room with a barrel-like object that goes up and down when you jump on it.  This is very frustrating!
</font>
<p>
This is definitely the #1 trouble spot in any Sonic game.  Jump on the barrel and hold down on the D-pad after you land.  The barrel will go down a bit, and will then stop and go back up.  When the barrel begins to move back up, hold up.  When the barrel slows and begins to go down, hold down again.  Whenever the barrel shifts momentum, hold the direction that it's about to move in.  Eventually, it will go further up and down each time.  The level continues at the bottom of the shaft that the barrel is in.  When you get the barrel low enough, you will be able to jump off and continue through the level.

<b>Mysterious Sonic 2 Zones and the Elusive Sonic Arcade</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
How can I get to the Hidden Palace Zone in Sonic 2?  Or the Wood Zone, or the Neo Green Hill Zone, or the Dust Hill Zone?<p>Do you have any Sonic Arcade Info?
</font>
<p>
The Hidden Palace Zone is the most famous of several zones that were removed from Sonic 2.  It was apparently removed late in Sonic 2's development, because it appeared often in gaming magazines and promotions before the game was released.  We don't really know why the zones were taken out, but it probably had to do with keeping the game on schedule or saving cartridge space.

<b>Searching for Sonic Cartoons</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Where can see the Sonic cartoons or get videos of them?
</font>
<p>AoStH ("Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog," the syndicated spoof cartoon that prremiered in 1993) is still running on <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011208000000/http://disney.go.com/disneychannel/toondisney/schedule.html>Toon Disney</a> and some independent local channels. Tapes can sometimes be found at Wal-Mart or Blockbuster.

<p>As far as we know, SatAM ("Sonic The Hedgehog," the dramatic ABC Saturday Morning cartoon that premiered in 1993) is not being broadcast anywhere at this time.  However, it is available on VHS and DVDs are confirmed to be in the works.

<p>Sonic Underground (the syndicated fantasy cartoon, which premiered in 1999) is not currently available either on the air or on video, as far as we know.

<p>The Sonic Anime ("Sonic The Hedgehog," released in Japan in 1996) was translated to English and released internationally as "Sonic The Movie."  You can probably find it at Suncoast.

<font color=ff8000>Tails</font> and <font color=ff6090>Amy</font> - 8<p>
As far as I know, all other characters' ages are unknown.<p>

Issues:<p>
Knuckles will soon turn 16 in the comics.<br>
Sally is 16 in the SatAM cartoon, but 15 in the comics.  Elias' age is unknown, but he's definitely older than Sally.<br>
Julie-Su's age of 15 is unconfirmed right now.<br>
Amy is 10 in the comics, and seems to be in her early teens according to SoA.  It's rumored that she'll also be a teenager in Sonic Adventure.  However, 8 is still the age given by SoJ.<p>

According to Sonic Team and Sega Of Japan, Tails is 8.  Tails was first revealed to the public by Sega Of America as 4 and a half, and that was the age used in gaming magazines, in AoStH, and on the plush toy's box, but they changed this claim when Sonic Team listed his age in the Saturn game Sonic Jam.  However, the SatAM cartoon depicted him as a 10-year-old, and the Fleetway version of Tails is a teenager.

<b>Sega's Restrictions</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Why wasn't Sega as strict with SatAM as they are with Archie Comics?
</font>
<p>Sega is different today.  Back then they thought they could do no wrong. Today's Sega takes everything more seriously, especially their mascot. Another reason is that DiC is much larger than Archie, so they had more power to force Sega to listen to them.

<b>SatAM Cancellation</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Why was Sonic's ABC Saturday morning cartoon cancelled?
</font>
<p>
The most popular theory is that the Power Rangers drove Sonic's ratings down.  ABC moved the show's timeslot several times to avoid competition from Power Rangers, but rarely advertised the change, and that made it hard to keep track of the time when the show came on.  Fox kept following them by moving Power Rangers to whatever timeslot Sonic was put in.  The combination of confusing time slot changes and competition from the Power Rangers is supposedly what drove SatAM out.

<b>SatAM 3rd Season</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
I read something about a 3rd season for SatAM.  Can you give me information about it?
</font>
<p>
You can find out more info on the cancelled 3rd season on the <a href="/sonichq/cartoon/" target="whole">Cartoon Info Page</a>.  In short, the red eyes seen in the 2nd season finale belonged to Naugus, who would soon take over Robotropolis and make Robotnik his Snively-like assistant.  Snively would be kicked out and join the Freedom Fighters.  I think that Snively becoming a Freedom Fighter would have led to some very interesting situations and plenty of chances for character development.

<b>Shadow In SA2</b><br>
<p><font color="red">**SPOILER**<br>
Did Shadow die in SA2?
</font>
<p>Only Sonic Team can answer that, but I'd say yes.  Shadow could have gotten out with Chaos Control, but I really don't see any reason for Sonic Team to do that.  For one thing, he's a total Sonic clone.  Unless they do the "rivalry" theme again, which I doubt they will, there wouldn't really be any point to making Shadow playable unless they made his gameplay radically different from Sonic's.
