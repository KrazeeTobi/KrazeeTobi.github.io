<p><font color="red">
hello!  Your web page is REALLY cool! I couldn't do a better job myself!  Keep up the good work, fellows! I saw the questions and answers and a good think too because I have some questions, conerning what I saw in the page, and other stuff.<p>

1. I hear dic doesnt like the saturday abc show, and I can see why, comparing to Mario's show. Mario's show has all the characters in the right role and attitude and they use the same music and sounds, and history. Nintendo must be PROUD of that show.  While Sonic's show, they have a bunch of characters never seen before on games, Sonic takes his role as a hero WAY far, Tails is just treated as a young kid, who in training, and hardly ever comes around, and Sally seemed to take role as both Sonic's sidekick and leading lady (Always going with Sonic, taking Tails' and Amy-Rose's spotlights).  The other cartoon on the other hand takes it differently.  It is probably for little children, but some charcters are there from the game, they have Sonic's music, and Tails' is accually treated as a sidekick!  So what I'm tyring to ask here is, does DiC like the crappy cartoon? (sorry if that was long).<p>

2. What's the deal with Amy-Rose? In Fleetway, she is contantly captured by enemies, and you can't save her in the begining of Sonic cd, and you can't leave her behind. Is she a Princess Peach of the Sega?<p>

3. Did Ken Pender get rid of Charmy just so they can make room for Julie-Sue? She joined the Chaotix the same time he left. Nothing personal, I mean, I LOVE Julie, but it
makes you think.<p>

4. When is that Sonic Underground making a debut? i hear people say the same time as Dreamcast, and some others in April. Perhaps you know?<p>

5. Where do you get a Sega32x?<p>

6. Is Julie-Sue in that Chaotix game?<p>

Thank you for taking time to reading my questions.  C-Ya!<br>

Thanks for the compliment.<br>

1. I don't know what DiC thinks of either cartoon, though, according to rumor, SEGA didn't like SatAM, for basicallly the reasons you mentioned.  The show never really tried to acknowledge the existense of the Sonic games.  SEGA used Sally for promotion sometimes, but they seemed to pay a lot more attention to the crappy cartoon, even basing a game and some of their box art on it.<br>

2. Yeah, sort of.<br>

3. Probably not, since Ray is joining the Chaotix now, and no one left to make room for him.<br>

4. April.  It's already showing in France.<br>

5. Some stores still have it.  I saw it a few months ago at an electronic boutique.  If you can't find one there, try Babbage's, Toys 'R Us, or a used games store.  You can get a lot of the games, including Chaotix, at a site that is one of the sponsors of <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.segacon.com">SegaCon</a>, but I forgot what it was called.  I also saw a bunch of games, including Virtua Racing Deluxe, at a Toy's 'R Us a few weeks ago.<br>

6. No.

From what you know is Sonic Underground going to me more like Adventures or SatAM?  (Not charactor wise)<p>
Soneec
</font><p>
Neither, really.  From what I've seen, it doesn't have anything to do with the games, comics, or AoStH.  And the only known similarities with SatAM are the inclusion of SWATBots and Robotnik's design.

Hi, it's SonIXcool again.  I'm known to my friends as IXe by the way. I have more questions.<p>

1) How can I get a web-site for my comic "Sonic Hype" started.  I'm a techno idiot.  Also, the comic needs a new artist.  My friend Sketch moved. Can you think of anyone who would be interested?<p>

2) Why do you say Espio is short for "Espionage"?<p>

3) You told me Robotnik and Kodos became friends to get rid of Nate Morgan in an earlier question.  There's a problem with that.  Morgan came to Mobotropolis before Robotnik, and he left just when the war began.  Looooong before Buttnik showed up.  Can you think of a better answer?<p>

4) Have you seen my story "The Mecha War"? If you have, what do you think of it?
</font><p>
1) Most of the free website places have graphical page editors.  Sorry, I don't knopw of anyone.<br>
2) Because all SEGA Sonic characters (except Amy, Ray, Bean, and Bark) are named after an ability or trait.  Espio can hide through camouflage.  I know it's a longshot, but that's probably where they got the name.<br>
3) Oops...mistook that for Naugus. What was the original question?<br>
4) I haven't seen it, sorry.

I was wondering when Sonic Underground is going to air?  I downloaded two of the movie clips, and I'm inpressed.  I thought it was going to be similar to AoS.  It's more similar to Satam Sonic.  Now I can't wait till it comes out. So when does it?<br>
However, I still hope for the Sonic Movie.<br>

Ben Hurst hasn't emailed me in a month, so it looks like it'll be a while.  While we're waiting, I'm going to start interviewing other guests.  If anyone has any suggestions for guests, be sure to post them on Mobius Forum.

waitaminit. you said to that other guy that antoine doesn't have another
last name besides D'Coolette? he does, i believe the comix and SatAM
gave him 2 diff last names. in the episode "Fed up with Antoine" he
announced that his last name was "De Pardeux". i think that's how you
spell that.<br>

Though the issue wasn't wonderful, it was a big improvement. Let's
see...#56
was the last good issue, and this one's better than it. The art was
fairly
descent also, though Prince Elias wasn't drawn perfectly on-model.

OK I got two questions
1) How much longer are you expecting the Sonic comics are going to last.<br>
2) "Aliens" and " Predator" have been popular crossovers with other
comics(ex.Batman, Superman, Judge Dredd.) Is it possible to make a
crossover
with Sonic going against "Aliens" or "Predators?" Or will it be simply
to
violent for a Sonic comic?<br> 
SpeedySwaf
</font>
<p>1) A long long long time. Especially with Dreamcast and Sonic Adventure coming. I expect Sonic to at least reach 150 or 200.<br>
2) Yep, they're too violent.

Could you please tell me:<br>
1. What are the full names of Julie-Su,Rotor, and Vector? I need it for a
piece of fan-fic.<br>
2. Why does Sega hate the SatAM series? It's a lot better than that
other
series that managed to last over 60 episodes.<br>
Thanks!<br>
PMM4815
</font>
<p>1) Julie-su: we don't know. Rotor Walrus, Vector Crocodile.<br>
2) Sega hates that show because the show focuses on several different characters that's not from Sega. Sally, Bunnie, Rotor, and Antoine are made by DiC Productions. That's why Sega likes the other show, because it focuses on Sonic and Tails. Don't know why they like Sonic Underground though...
