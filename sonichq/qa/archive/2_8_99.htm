<font size="-1"><b>Tips !!??</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Hi,  Are there any tips sites you know of for Sonic - specifically for Sonic 3D?.  I can't figure out how to get past Dr Robotnik and his bombs on act 3 of Level 1 !!<br>
Rob.<p>
</font>
Umm...try Sonic HQ Game Info.  It's got info for every game, and walkthroughs for most.  The Sonic Foundation, the Domain of NetRaptor, and Sonic Rave also have tips/codes.  They're on the Links Page.<p>
The boss: Robotnik floats after you and drops a ball which chases you. Whenever it looks like he's about to drop the ball, get away from him! Plug Robotnik when he comes down to pick up the ball. Its BEST to stand at the TOP of one of the inclines but try getting Rootnik to position himself at the BASE of the incline. This makes an easier jump for you as hitting the Egg-O-matic will do NOTHING but hitting the glass of the Egg-O-Matic produces the desired effect. Also, try grabbing only one ring at a time.  If you lose your ring, there will still be more available in the boss room. - mostly taken from the Game Info Page

</font>
1. Archie hasn't defined Hershey's age yet in any books.<br>
2. Well, we don't know when the concept of Knuckles was formed, but he was introduced in Sonic 3, which was released on February 2nd, 1994.<br>
3. As with Knuckles, we only know when they were introduced.<br>Espio, Vector, and Charmy were introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix, which was released on April 21st, 1995 in Japan and at about the same time in the US.  I'm pretty sure it was the same day.<br>Mighty and Ray were introduced in SegaSonic the Hedgehog (The Arcade Game), which was released in mid-to-late 1993 in Japan.<br>
4. There seem to be 7 - but more could be discovered later.<br>

I got your response and I have proceeded in beating Silver Sonic, but that stupid robotnik thing is a pain, how can I beat him?<br>
Aaron<p>
</font>
When his claws are even, jump as high as you can and hit him in the chest.  If you've got good timing and plenty of lives to spare, you can hit him 6 or 7 times before he flies off.  However, when you haven't beaten him before, just hit him when you're sure it's safe.  After he flies into the air and targets you, run to one side of the room and wait.  As soon as the crosshair "locks on" run to the other side of the screen and stay there until he flies off.  Before he does, Robotnik will shoot claws at you, but you should be out of range.  It's possible to hit him a few times at that point, but it's safest to wait.  Let the crosshairs lock again, but this time don't run off too far.  Robotnik will be walking again, and repeat your earlier attacking.  He'll keep alternating between walking and shooting.  Never get behind him, because you can't hit him from behind and he'll just drop bombs on you.

what happened to Tails at launch base zone where Sonic goes to when he wins the game?<br>

p. s. I still don't know how old Tails is<p>
</font>
That was probably a bug that they didn't have time to fix.  However, Tails probably just swam out of the water.  In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, they fixed it so that Tails joins you on the platform on the Death Egg.<p>

See the FAQ.  Just take your pick of which age you want to consider "official."

<p><font color="red">
Can you tell me the lyrics to the main Sonic Adventure theme song?<p>
</font>
Open Your Heart . . . MAIN THEME OF "SONIC Adventure"<br>
(Music : J. Senoue & K. Tokoi Words : J. Senoue & T. Fukada Arrange : J. Senoue)<p>

Thunder, rain, and lightning<br>
Danger, water rising<br>
Clamour, sirens wailing<br>
It's such a bad sign<p>

Shadows of dark creatures<br>
Steel clouds floating in the air<br>
People run for shelter<br>
What's gonna happen to us!?<p>

All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake<br>
I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do<br>
You and I are same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change<br>
Your's is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose<p>

* Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go<br>
I know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br>
I'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others<br>
Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do<p>

OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT<p>

Ancient city blazing<br>
Shadows keep attacking<br>
Little children crying<br>
Confusion, hopeless anger<p>

I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy<br>
All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way<p>

* Repeat<p>

OPEN YOUR HEART...AND YOU'LL SEE...<p>

(Guitar Solo)<p>

If it won't stop, there will be no future for us<br>
Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free<p>

I know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br>
Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do<p>

GOTTA OPEN YOUR HEART, DUDE!<p>

* Repeat<p>

OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT

<p>1) Possible but unlikely.<br>
2) Hmm...look at the question below.<br>
3) I have no idea...but I wouldn't expect top quality, since it IS a fan porject.<br>
4) Well, to a human eye, no. To a fur eye, yes.<br>
5) Maybe parts of it, but the whole: no.<br>
6) Yes, several are out already in Asia.<br>
7) Maybe. The news people haven't heard anything yet...<br>

<p><font color="red">
1.  Okay, this is making me nuts and if figured if anyone knew the
answer,
it'd be you guys.  This question may sound dumb but there are some
rumors
circulating the net saying Sonic Spinball and Sonic Crackers are fan
made
games.  Someone said SEGA found people making Sonic Spinball and said,
"Hey
that's not too bad." And put it out on the market so they could work on
Sonic
3.  But that makes no sense because SEGA of America made Sonic Spinball,
right?  Or is that other guy right?

<p>2.  About a week and a half ago I sent my link to the links people and
they
haven't responded.  Does that mean they didn't like my page?  I thought
it was
original and I promise you will not find an "Ask Nicole" page that
works like
an 8-ball anywhere else.

<p>3.  Did Dulcy ever appear in the first season of SatAM?  I don't
remember her
doing so.

<p>4.   This is something you wrote on your answer page:  "The force is
with
him...aways...."
Don't you mean always?
<p>5. when is this interview with Ben Hurst coming?
<p>Soneec
</font>
<p>1) The game was made by Sega TI. So yes, it's by Sega. Sonic Crackers never made it out, and it's designed by the same team that made Knuckles Chaotix 32X.<br>
2) Your link is at 31, but it should be 30 because we're dropping the axe on StarHedgehog's page, since it has nothing to do with Sonic now...on the nest update.<br>
3) No.<br>
4) yes.<br>
5) Ben delayed it because he doesn't have time right now, so it looks like we'll have to wait until he have some time.

<p><font color="red">
Dear Sonic HQ,<br>
Whazzup.  The names are SonIXCool, Vector J. Croc, and Knuckles
the
Sketchkidna.  We are a team of Sonic fans led by myself, SonIXCool.  We
call
ourselves the SONIX-CIRCUIT (Hey, I formed the group.  I should get to
name it
after myself.) We are planning a big intro into Sonic Fandom, and we
need some
info.
<p>First, some questions from me, SonIXCool, the most insane kid ever to
exist.
<p>1) How do we get permission to write fan fics from SEGA, Archie, and
DIC
and how do we get them copyrighted?
<p>2) We have plans for a fan comic titled "Sonic Hype." How do we get
permission for that?
<p>And now, my insane colleague, but not as insane as I am, Vector J. Croc,
actually has a comic related question.
<p>3) If Warlord Kodos hated Overlanders so much (as mentioned in THE
NAUGUS
TRILOGY?), why did he become Robotnik's mentor? (as mentioned in HEART
OF
DARKNESS, SONIC #36.)
<p>And finally, the only sane member of our team, Knuckles the
Sketchkidna, our
team artist, has a few questions.
<p>4) When we send in fan fics, can they be illustrated?
<p>5) When we send in fan fics, can we send in an attachment that
tells
everyone about us that will actually be accessible on this site?
<p>Well, that's all our questions.  Love the site.  Hope that one day, our
works
will be included amongst yours and other Sonic nuts.
<p>By the way, we like people to think we're nuts, aside from Knuckles the
Sketchkidna, who is actually quite normal. (We're working on that.)
<p>We're way past gone
<p>SonIXCool, the Ultimate Sonic Fan<br>
Vector J. Croc, the Biggest Chaotix Fan<br>
Knuckles the Sketchkidna, Knuckles Artistically Gifted Alternate Reality Twin
</font>
<p>Hehe, everyone loves our site! Well, we love fans too!
<p>1) You just state in you fan fiction that the characters are properties of Sega.<br>
2) Same as above.<br>
3) He wanted to get rid of Nate Morgan, so they formed an mutual friendship.<br>
4) No. We can't allow that because that would take too much time for us.<br>
5) Just write it IN the fan-fic like everyone else. That way, people will have to read it if they want to read the story.<br>
<p>And we wish you luck on your comic!

<p><font color="red">
dear sonic hq:<br>
I love your site. It is perfect. I have a few questions and theories.
<p>I saw on Game Informer that Shining Force 3 was made by the Sonic Team.
Is this true?
<p>I think Knuckles glides because on his character profile he ate a lot of
fruit, and since the Angel Island floats the roots of the plants get
the 
minerals which makes the island float; therefor Knuckles glides.
<p>Miles got his two tails from pollution.
<p>Knuckle has the strip on his chest to protect him because on Sonic and
Knuckles he slides on the ground.
<p>Sincerely,<br>
A Freak of Sonic
</font>
<p>The Shinning Force series is NOT made by the Sonic Team, it is actually made by a second party developer for Sega (much like Rare to Nintendo) called Sonic. Sonic is set up by Sega to develop top programmers and producer they could pick up. But they're not the Sonic Team.
<p>Knuckles glides because he have the threads on his head, they spread out when he jumps, so he glides.
<p>We really don't know how Tails got his two tails...we might never know...
<p>Knuckles has the strip on his chest because it symblizes his gaurdianship.
