<b>Tales of Tails' Tails</b>
<p><font color=red>How did Tails get two tails?</font>
<p>One of the more commonly asked questions. A lot of theories on 
this one, too. However, Sonic Kids #2 has officially brought forth the 
answer that Tails was somehow born with those two tails of his.

<b>Sonic Anime</b>
<p><font color=red>Hello, Flyer here...<br>
I have a question concerning the Sonic Anime cartoon. Is there any swearing in it?  I plan to buy it as soon as it comes out if there is none.<br>
Well, Take Care<br>
Flyer</font>
<p>Well... all that I have to go by are the translations from the Anime 
in Japan as provided by Alessandro Sanasi. As he writes it, there are 
a couple of instances where they exclaim "Crap!", but from what I 
read, that's about it.
<p>However, there is one scene in which Sonic uses an offensive gesture.

<b>SatAM</b>
<p><font color=red>Dear Sonic HQ,<br>
My question is will the Sonic the Hedgehog Satam cartoon series come 
back on televison and if so, when? And will it be new or old reruns?
Just curious cus I would mind watching them again so I would like to 
know the answer to my question, please. Thanx.</font>
<p>At this point in time, no one plans on re-airing the SatAM 
series anytime soon. In the meantime, word from DiC is that they are 
reproducing some of the SatAM videos that they first sold a couple 
years back. However, those tapes only feature first season episodes.

<b>Various Questions</b>
<p><font color=red>Hi guys. You really have a great site. I was just wondering:<p>
Do you guys think that Sega and Squaresoft could work together to make 
a Sonic game?<p>
What is this Sega World I keep on hearing about?<p>
Will DiC or Sega ever start selling tapes of Sonic Satam's second 
season?.<p>
Thanks,<br>
Dustin R.</font>
<p>1) At this point, the two sides haven't agreed to the idea. It 
would prove interesting, though. Maybe that could amount to the purest 
Sonic RPG of all time. But that's just my take on it.<p>

2) SEGA WORLD is an amusement park in Australia devoted to the SEGA 
and its characters. They have a website at <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.segaworld.com.au/>https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.segaworld.com.au/</a> so you can see what 
they've got. You can even buy stuff from them, too. I did.<p>

3) The way things stand right now, they're not. However, I've heard a 
rumor or two saying that they might. I wouldn't believe the hype, 
though, unless someone could offer proof.

<b>Another Series?</b>
<p><font color=red>Will there be another series or movie serial?</font>
<p>We have the Sonic Underground series ready to start in the U.S. 
soon, but outside of that, no other major television ideas have been 
conceived.

<b>Comics Update</b>
<p><font color=red>Hi, I E-mailed you guys earlier, and in that E-Mail, I stated the 
fact that I missed out on LOTS of the comics (I think). Well, For some 
reason (dont ask why) I stopped reading the comics at issue 62. Now 
its more than a year later and I want the comics again! So, I was 
wondering, if you could give me a BRIEF lo-down on whats been 
happening since then- did I hear about Sonic getting married, or 
something? I stopped right when King Acorn was telling Sally to Marry 
Antoine- but never found out how it ended up! PLEASE TELL ME so I can 
understand whats going on when I renew my Sonic Subscription! By the
way, I DID check the "Comics" section of your page first, but something screws
up when I try to go to the "Comics Archive".<br>
Please help me!<br>
Chris Aroo</font>
<p>Well, if you're interested in the wedding angle, that has yet 
to be resolved. In fact, that will be addressed again in a few weeks 
when Sally actually does undergo that rite which King Acorn asked her 
to go through.<p>
As a recap, let's quickly review what's happened until now:<p>
> Sonic & Tails found and defeated Naugus thanks to the help of an 
overlander named Nate Morgan. Nate is an Overlander who was the real 
creator of the power ring and a lot of the major advances in 
technology, NOT Uncle Chuck.<p>
> King Acorn sent Geoffrey St. John and a Secret Service team to the 
Floating Island to find the long-lost Queen Alicia and Prince Elias. 
They were successful, but Queen Alicia is on life-support, and Elias 
has been named the next to throne even though he doesn't want it.<p>
> Robotnik has returned, sort of. Robo-Robotnik from Sonic #19 crossed 
dimensions and attacked through a giant space station. He has since 
reclaimed Mobotropolis and re-captured the roboticized population, 
except for Sonic's parents. However, his robotic body was destroyed, 
and he now assumes the form of Eggman from the Sonic Adventure games.<p>
Those have been the 3 key angles that have gone on in the last year 
and a half. What do you think?

<b>Knuckles' Appearances</b>
<p><font color=red>What issues of Archie's Sonic did Knuckles appear in between #13 
and #29? I'm trying to find them all.  Thanks :)<p>
True Red</font>
<p>The only issues that Knuckles appeared in within that time 
span are the Sonic & Knuckles special, the Triple Trouble special, and 
the Chaotix special. As you can see, he was really only a bit player 
at the time.

<b>2 Questions</b>
<p><font color=red>I have two questions<p>
1. Exactly what is the difference between the chaos emeralds and the
super emeralds of Floating Island?<p>
2. What is the Little Planet?<p>
These are the only questions I have, I'm a real hard core Sonic fan.</font>
<p>1) The Super Emeralds are supposed to be the rarest of all the 
power sources on the entire planet of Mobius. Very few, if any, are 
supposed to exist anymore. Based on how the comics depict them, the 
Super Emeralds are hundreds of times more powerful than the standard 
Chaos Emeralds.<p>
2) The Little Planet was created for the Sonic CD game on the 
now-defunct SEGA CD platform. According to the plotline, it's a moon 
of sorts that appears above a place on Mobius called Never Lake for a 
span of a few days annually. It's also the home of the Time Stones.
Robotnik tried to claim the Time Stones, and also sent Metal Sonic to 
capture Amy Rose. This brought Sonic onto the scene, who captured all 
the Time Stones, rescued Amy Rose, and restored the Little Planet to 
its proper state.

<b>Sonic Underground</b>
<p><font color=red>what time and channel is sonic underground on ?</font>
<p>It's part of BKN2 (Bohbot Kids' Network 2), one of the 2 groups of cartoons sold by Bohbot to local stations.  You'll probably find it in the morning on a UPN, WB, Fox, or independent channel.

<p><font color=red>Wasn't Sally in the story of the Sonic Cd instruction manual? If I remember correctly, she was kidnapped by Robotnik when they were looking at the little planet.<br>
Jeff VanVranken</font>
<p>Sort of.  It was actually Amy.  When the manual was translated to English, Amy was given the name "Princess Sally", probably as a tie-in with the soon-to-be-released SatAM cartoon.

<b>The Games Factory and The Mecha Sonics</b>
<p><font color=red>Ive downloaded all the fan games some are good some are not my kind well anyways theyre all maken with The Games Factory how or where can I get it I wanna make my own fan game oh and if you wanna chat with me on the aol buddy chat my screen name is METALLAGEX all the letters are capital thats it for now and a final question are the mecha sonics (the one in Sonic CD and the one in Sonic & Knuckles and in Sonic 3 & Knuckles )the same one?</font>
<p>1. The Games Factory is made by Europress Software (www.europress.co.uk).  I'm not sure if it can be bought in a store in North America, but I think it is for sale on their website.
<br>2. The Mecha Sonics... That's a good question.  It's hard to say if they were the same or not.  The Silver Sonic from Sonic 2 is definitely a different robot - both Mecha and Silver appear in Sonic Adventure.  However, since the 'hybrid' design from S3&K doesn't make an appearance, it's possible that the S3&K Mecha was just the normal one, but with different armor.  On the other hand, the CD Mecha has made many appearances (Sonic Adventure, Knuckles' Chaotix, Sonic Triple Trouble, the racing games), and he didn't have an alternate armor in any of those games.

<b>3 Questions</b>
<p><font color=red>1) What Does AoSTH stand for?<br>
2) Where can i find a ROM of Knuckles Chaotix?<br>
3) How many people think Sonic Underground should be where its namesuggests?<br>
Scott I. Prower</font>
<p>1. Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog<br>
2. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be one.  Contrary to popular belief, there are 32X emulators, but no Chaotix ROM.<br>
3. *Raises hand enthusiastically* I do! I (Vec) finally saw part of an episode yesterday, and I could very easily rant about what I thought of it.  However, this isn't the place.  Let's just say that they should NOT have let Jaleel White do all 3 hedgehogs...

<b>Sonic on DC</b>
<p><font color=red>Will "Sonic Adventure" be the only Sonic game on the "Dreamcast"?<br>Michael</font>
<p>Let's hope not!  There have been a lot of unconfirmed rumors about other games, but no proof yet.  Unfortunately, the wait for the next Sonic game on DC might be longer than expected - Sonic Team is apparently working on a new game, and it's not Sonic Adventure 2.  The good news is that there are other development groups that could potentially make a Sonic game.
