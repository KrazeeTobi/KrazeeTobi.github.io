PERIOD." And why did he hate Sonic's Uncle and maybe Sonic also? I know that Sonic's Uncle made the Machine that make animal intoRobot, but he is under control by ro-butt-nick and he is really goodSonic's Uncle than anyone people. I feel sorry for Uncle Chuck thatSally's Father was treat negative thing to Sonic's Uncle. Why is theKing Doing this?? And he doing bad thing to other good robot (notDumb swat robot). Tell me. Why is he doing negative thing toward Freedom Fighter's include Sally. Is he still in the bad past?? Is hejust habit to hate thing?? Tell me. Please write back:-) I am really best fan of your and remember that.<br>Mike Moon</font><p>Well, our best fan, the King was under the control of Naugus when he turned against Uncle Chuck. So it wasn't his fault, so to speak. As for Sally and Sonic, well, the "force" is telling him it's a good thing to do. So in other words, it's also not his fault. But really, you'll never see Sonic and Sally marry as long as Sega's current "no emotion" policy stands.</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Sonic Movies...</b><br><p><font color="red">Ever since I downloaded the second season of sonic from Real Video, the viewing was very pleasurable.  However, the video quality was a bit distored. When I downloaded a video clip of a the show, the video and sound quality was realy good.  So good that I could watch in full screen!  Anyway, is there any sites that enable you to download every episode just like Limpcombs, only in AVI, MOV format?  I know right now all there is, are the RealPlayer formats for the 26 episodes.<br>-Rich</font><p>Currently? No. Reason? It takes a long time to make a MOV file. 1 min in the movie takes 20 min to make.</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Fastest Thing Alive...</b><br><p><font color="red">Hi Sonic HQ staff,<br>I've been hearing the Fastest thing alive music at the home page,Boy, I just love it.

Got a couple of questions & comments. First and foremost, your Sonic HQ is the bestSonic site I've found so far.  Do you think the SatAM cartoon has a realistic chance of ever getting back on the air, or having a new season? SatAMis my main interest in the Sonic universe.  I have a lot of the SatAM on tape that I recorded while it was on the air. I have them all, except for Ultra Sonic, and that "Ro-becca" thing which I "accidentally" erased. I would be happy to make copies of them, for anyone interested, for the just the cost of videotapes. However, I'm not sure about the legalities of that, or if someone's already doing it or has come upwith something better. Please let me know what you think of this idea.  Is DiC in charge of the new sonic cartoon coming soon? And also, last question, is Dan Drazen still writing fanfics? I really like his work.  ONE MORE THING-I am part of a garage band, and last month convinced my band mates to learn the Sonic SatAM theme song.(I already knew it.) If we got our version recorded, would you consider putting it on yoursite?  OK-That's about it for now. I hope I hear from you, I have emailed some other sites and haven't gotten responses. Please email back, blueberry95@hotmail.com, and let me know what's up. Thanx a ton.<br>-Aaron </font><p>Thanks for calling us the best site! There are a bunch of other great Sionic sites such as tSf and Artail Productions. The SatAM cartoon was canceled by Sega. So for it to come back, you need a good reason. So far, there are none, so it'll most likely stay dead. As for making copies...well, it depends, selling mass copies is not possible. As for Dan Drazen, he's writing a book right now. He will get back to the fan fiction world after he's done with the book. And finally, we would love to have your version of the SatAM theme song!</font></font></font></td></table></font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="arial"><font size="-2">All Sonic and related characters are trademarks of Service and Games Enterprise.
