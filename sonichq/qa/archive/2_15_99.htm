waitaminit. you said to that other guy that antoine doesn't have another
last name besides D'Coolette? he does, i believe the comix and SatAM
gave him 2 diff last names. in the episode "Fed up with Antoine" he
announced that his last name was "De Pardeux". i think that's how you
spell that.<br>

There is something that has been bothering me a lot.
In the S3&K Casino Type Bonus Stage, what do the little
circles with the R's in them for. When I touch them
there's a 'ding' sound. What does it do?<br>

<font size="-1"><b>Espio, Sonic, and Mighty, and Where's My Fan-fic</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Hi!  It's me, SonIXcool again.  I have a few questions.

1) Why is everyone whining about Sonic comics lately.  I think they're better now than ever.  At least they' center on Sonic.  I mean, in issues before #47, everything was about Knuckles or Sally (one of the main reasons they gave Knux his own book.) By the way, I though ENDGAME rocked. (Warning: I am very fragile emotionally.  Do not get mad at me or call me a loser.  It will send me right to my therapist.)

2) Does Ken P. have plans to write a story about Espio anytime soon. Not a back up, but a story that really explores the character's personality?

3) What does "Espio" mean?

4) Why is Mighty so nice?  I mean, he's the strong tough guy, but Ken P. writes him like he's just a sentimental sissy.  I mean, if he's an old friend of Sonic, I'd expect him to be a little more rough around the edges. Don't get me wrong.  Aside from Knux and Espio, he's my favorite character in KTE.

5) I sent in a fan-fic titled "The Mecha War."  Where is it?  Not that I'm impatient, I just want to know how soon it'll be up.

I hope you guys don't think I'm weird.  I'm just different (to quote my therapist.)
</font><p>
1. There are numerous reasons, but one of the biggest is that a lot of people want the Freedom Fighters to be more involved in the stories.<br>
2. Hopefully, but there haven't been any announcements yet.<br>
3. It's probably short for "Espionage"<br>
4. The comics take a lot of creative license.  Ken Penders probably just didn't want Mighty to be too much like Sonic.  I'm not very familiar with how they're portrayed in the comic, but according to Knuckles' Chaotix, Mighty is clever, sorta reserved and quiet, and dislikes weakness.  Vector's friendly and laid-back, Charmy's sophisticated and calm, and Espio is freedom-loving, sorta hot-headed, and a showoff.<br>
5. Trooper has to read, rate, summarize, and spell-check each one, so it's not easy to get fics up quickly, especially since there are so many submitted.<p>

P.S. - I thought your questions were great, and you should be glad to be different.

Dear Sonic HQ,<br>
This is B.J. I have a question. May I use the "Speed Slider Zone" music for my webpage? I really liked it, and hey, keep up the outstanding work. I will give you my webpage address later. I must go now.<br> 
Thanks!<br>
B.J.<p>
Wow, did Sega ever see your site? Boy, will they be amazed. Best of luck.
</font><p>
Wow!  We're glad you liked the site!  Thanks!  I don't know if anyone from SEGA has seen the site, but it seems likely.  I know that some sites (Sonic Corner and Radical City) have gotten e-mail from people who work for SEGA.<p>

Koryan wrote the MIDI, not Sonic HQ.  But I'm pretty sure you can use it.

In the sonic music section, the sonic song frum the sonic anime section
is gone, and it was one of my favorites. why is it gone?<br>

</font>
<p>I have no idea...I'll go ask Edan.<br>
*runs over to Edan's place*<br>
Zifei: What happened to that Sonic anime song?!<br>
Edan: What the heck are you talking about?<br>
Zifei: You know, <i>that</i> song!<br>
Edan: Hmm...you get the new Music section up and I'll have it up.<br>
Zifei: Ehh...OK.<br>
*runs back here*<br>
Well, it looks like you'll have to wait 'till our new Music page is up. Which won't take very long...IF I hit a break such as the SPRING Break...

<p><font color="red">
Hi!  It's me again!  Hope ya dont mind answering some more questions
from me. Heh heh...
<p>1) I know Archie comics is a little bit screwed up, but is the Fleetway
version better?<br>
2) When the date of Sonic Adventure coming out?<br> 
3) Since sending petitions to DiC to make a 3rd season of Sonic wont
do, what
if we send them to Sega instead?  Will that help? Even if they dont
like the
cartoon?<br>
4) How on earth can you get Chaos Emeralds in Sonic CD?<br>
5) In Knuckles #8, when Enerjak dropped Knuckles form the atmosphere,
why
didn't Knuckles just glide?<br>
6) Who invented the power rings?  Nate or Chuck?<br>
7) Do you absouletly think that Knuckles goes great with Julie-Su?<br>
8) Will Fiona the False Fox appear sometime?<br>
9) Did Antoine have another last name in the cartoon besides D'Coolete<br>
10) On Sonic Jam, for the Sonic Animation where Dr. Robotnik dressed as
Sonic
and made him look bad, what happened after the 'To Be Continued'?<br>

<p>Ok...I may have more questions, but these just went through my head for
the night..so I may return...heeheehee<br>
SonicCats
</font>
<p>1) Read the special in the news section...it's not better, in fact, it's down right terrible right now.<br>
2) 9-9-99.<br>
3) It would help if you can get over 1 million people to sign it, other wise, no. Sega *hates* the SatAM.<br>
4) They're in special stages.<br>
5) Good question, maybe Enerjak didn't let him.<br>
6) Depend on who you ask, ask Ben Hurst, the SatAM writer, it's Chuck; then if you ask Karl Bollers, the Sonic comic writer, it's Nate.<br>
7) Just like Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade. Yes.<br>
8) Not according to Ken Penders.<br>
9) No.<br>
10) That, I think was a commercial, and I don't remember the details, sorry.

<font size="-1"><b>Spin dash vs. figure 8.</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
I have some questions about sonic cd and the archie comics.    
<p>1)In sonic cd you can do the moves 'spin dash' and the 'figure-8' but
whats the diffrance between them I know  the spin dash protects you but
whats so good about the figure-8?<br>   
2) In Brave New World what happend to the swat-bots.<br>
3)In the Amy Rose and Dulcy story what happend to that guy behind the
book case.<br>
Spectre
</font>
<p>1) Figure 8 is just a cool adition to the arsenal of moves. You get a great burst of speed, which is useful in a lot of different situations, but spin dash is <i>more</i> useful.<br>
2) They kept on operating, I assume that the Freedom Fighters destroyed them after they started to rebuild Mobotropolis.<br>
3) That is for you to find out in the future comic issues.

Your site directs me to StarHedgehog's page for all the videos of the

american ones are nowhere to be seen. Do you know where I can find them.

<p>Hmm...in the mist of the MP3 problems on Simplenet, basicly ALL the major Sonic sites took down the Real Video, Real Audio, and MP3 files. Later we find that the Real Videos aren't illegal. So we'll just have to wait and see which site still has them. We might post some if we find them.
