<font size="-1"><b>Questions</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

1. Are you gonna change the pages like "Sonic Games Info" to match the new Sonic HQ Layout?<br>

2. What will happen if you try to run on water in a zone other than Windy Valley?<br>

3. If Sonic Underground is already out in France will we get the same episodes only translated and like five months (Or whenever it comes out here) later?<br>

4. Will Sonic have 3 2D quills in Sonic Underground or a lot of 3D quills?

<p></font>

1. No.  The current games layout is the new one.  Comic Info will have a similar layout to what games has now.  The Music Page's new layout is also different than the main layout.<br>

2. Well, this is only a guess, since I haven't played SA, but I'd expect it to work in any zone that has water.  The main question is whether the terrain in the other zones is designed to let you do it.  For example, Carnival Night Zone had water, but there was no way to run on its surface because of the terrain design.<br>

3. Yeah, they'll be the same episodes.<br>

4. It's hard to tell from the shots on Allessandro's page, but those who have watched the show have said that he has the many-quilled design.

Where can i find the emerald in act 2 of Gimmick Mt. zone?

<p></font>

Thanks to <a href=mailto:philip64@emirates.net.ae>Philip Buccianti</a> for this tip:<p>

<i>Gem 5 (RED): Right at the beginning of gimmick mt. zone act 2 is a sea

of spikes with conveyor belts and moving platforms to get you across to

a very steep slope. Near the top of this slope jump to the left intothe

wall and you'll be in a secret room. Climb through this room,collecting

the two extra lives on the way (optional) and at the top to the rightis

the chaos emerald.</i>

Can you play Tails in Sonic and Knuckles? 'Cuz he rules..Tails so kawaaaaiiiiiiii (kawaii=cute in japanese) plus..is there a way you canplay Knuckles in sonic 2? ^_^

<p></font>

Yes.  Just attach Sonic 3 to S&K to get the "full" game, Sonic 3 & Knuckles.  There are actually places in S&K that can only be reached by Tails.  For Knuckles in Sonic 2, attach Sonic 2 to S&K.

<font size="-1"><b>SatAM 3rd Season</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Dear Sonic HQ,<p>

I saw the Satam episode of "The Doomsday Project" and I was blown away!

Robutnik was finally defeated. But there was something peculiar about

the ending: Snively came out of that Underground Elevator

and some red glowing eyes appeared in the dark! Could those eyes have

been possesed by the one, the only....MECHA SONIC?! No, wait a sec.

Mecha Sonic can't blink, or can he? And also I don't remember seeing

Snively or Robotnik scanning any of Sonics data. Who knows, those eyes

might be Mecha Sonics or maybe not. We don't know and we'll probably

never know..or will we?<p>

Good news - thanks to Ben Hurst (SatAM writer), we do know.  The eyes in the elevator belonged to Naugus.  Check the FAQ and the Cartoon Info Page for more details.

<font size="-1"><b>Sonic Movie Rumors</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Is there supposed to be a Sonic movie or something? I keep hearing rumors about it.

<p></font>

Ben Hurst is trying to write his ideas for the 3rd season of SatAM as a script, w3hich could be made into a movie (very unlikely, but who knows?) or a fanfic.  Another rumor going around is that SEGA might make a movie based on Sonic Adventure.

<p><font color="red">

When will you update Sonic comic info?

<p></font>

It has been updated.  The renovation just hasn't been revealed yet, because it's not finished.  It has a layout somewhat similar to the layout of Game Info.
