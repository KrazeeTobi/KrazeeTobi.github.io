<b>More Questions</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Dear Sonic HQ,<br>

 &nbsp; Well, it's been a while since I've e-mailed you guys. Since I've been getting more of Sonic & Knuckles, a lot of questions I would ask you guys have been answered. Now, I'll take it upon myself to ask some interesting questions for this day and age (I sound like a geeky prophet).

 

<p>1.) Ok, so far Sega won't allow Sonic and Sally to get married or date. If we will never see them do that stuff, who would you think they would let Sonic marry or date?<br>

2.) Like question # 1, who will Knuckles marry or date in the end? Julie-su is nice, but I thought she was created be Archie Comics.<br>

3.) When would we likely see Big the Cat, E-102, and Perfect Chaos in Archie's Sonic comics?<br>

4.) When will Amy Rose develop her Sonic Adventure look for Archie's Sonic comics?<br>

5.) This question has been bugging me for a while, but who created Scratch: Sega or DiC Entertainment?<br>

6.) Ok, we all know the third season of Sonic the Hedgehog won't happen. My question is how come Sega didn't blow the whistle on Sonic Underground yet? I thought DiC France made up Manic, Sonia, Sleet, and Dingo?<br>

7.) How's the Fleetway Sonic comics going along overseas? I hear that its been going downhill.

<p>Well, if I have any questions, I know where to look. Also, sorry about the controversy about Tails' age that I started. I regret starting that up. I just hope it's finished.

<p>Christopher

                                                        

<p>P.S. If you guys, though you don't have a reason to, have any artwork you want to submit for my site, e-mail me at ahe@webzone.net.

<p>1. Only if he gets married or starts dating in the games first.  It would be foolish for them to let Archie write in a marriage without getting approval from SoJ first.<br>

2. Sega allows more freedom with Knuckles because he isn't the company mascot.  The "First Date" comics storyline starts with Knux #26.  However, for marriage, Knux would probably be subject to the same rules as Sonic.<br>

3. The SA adaptation will be somewhere around Sonic #78-82.  SSS #12 and Knux #34-37 will also cover SA.<br>

4. That hasn't been revealed yet.<br>

5. Probably DiC.<br>

6. It seems strange, after all we've heard about SEGA vs. Archie, but SEGA has said that they're satisfied with SU.  I don't think that SEGA's problems with Archie really had anything to do with the fact that the comic has a lot of non-SEGA characters.  I think they were more worried about Sonic and a non-SEGA character in love, and about the fact that the SatAM storyline had a very different atmosphere than the games.  The first issue obviously won't exist with SU, and perhaps they feel that SU's atmosphere is close enough.<br>

7. Yeah, it has been going downhill.  There's a special report about Fleetway management on the News Interviews page.

<b>Accent &amp; Ages</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

I have 2 questions:



<p>1. Why does sega say Knuckles has a jamacian accent, yet in the comics and cartoons that he has appearred in, he does't seem to have one?<br>

2. In Sonic's new game, "Sonic Adventure" for the Dreamcast system, exactly how old are Sonic, Knuckles, Tails and Amy in the game? They seem to be older than before and I was wondering if they actually are.

</font>

<p>1. I don't think SEGA has said anything about a jamaican accent.  I know that he had one in a strategy guide, but that's all that I've heard of it.<br>

2. They are supposed to have new ages, but we don't know what those ages are yet.

<b>Sonic Championship on Saturn?</b><br>

On yuor Sonic Games Info. page it says Sonic the Fighters is for Sega Saturn.Is this true? If so where can I get it?

<p>Thanks, Josh

</font>

<p>Sorry, it isn't true.  That was probably written when rumors were flying about a Saturn Sonic the Fighters release.  I'll change that on the next update.

<b>Diamond Dust Zone</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

In Diamond Dust Zone, Act 1, there is a part where you get the first five Flickies, how do you get the rest? (I suppose it may be a breakable wall). Thanks.

<p>Kyle Wightman

</font>

<p>Sorry, I'm kinda confused by your question.  After you get 5 Flickies, just find a Giant Ring like you did in the previous zones.  You'll go to another area with 5 more Flickies.  If you have trouble finding all of them, it's probably because some of them are in Snowman badniks.  Find a Snowman in a green hat that slides around and shoots at you.  Spin Attack it, and a Flicky in an ice cube will remain.  Attack the ice cube and the Flicky will be freed.

<b>Secret Levels</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

could you tell me how to access the secret levels on sonic 1,2+3 if there are any<br>

bye matty

</font>

<p>There aren't any secret levels in Sonic 1.<br>

The beta version of Sonic 2 had the Hidden Palace Zone, Wood Zone, and Genocide City Zone, but all were removed in the final version.  The level data for Hidden Palace actually still exists, and you can play the level with a Pro Action Replay.  Unfortunately, you can't finish it without Debug mode.  You can find out more in the FAQ.<br>

Sonic 3's secret levels are the ones that are added to the game when you lock-on with Sonic & Knuckles.

<p>Yes, there's swearing and a few rated PG-13 scenes.

I couldn't find the Sonic Anime videos at Blockbuster or Video King! Do

you know where I can find them?

<p>In Knuckles #25, page 6, when Julie-Su got all angry when Knuckles went

off, could that be the reason in the #27 preview that Julie-Su was

dating with that dork with the belt?

<p>Lee Bicker

</font>

<p>About the anime, we seriously don't have any idea if it is out or not, because we're getting conflicting reports.

<p>About Julie-su, you got that one right. But don't call the character a dork just yet...I get the feeling we're getting another "St. John" here...

1 Why did walmart wipe out Knuckles comics they could of just took it out of the store?<br>

2 If they go down on Knuckles comics how long will it take to get them sold again?<br>

3 Do you know what comic that kid read?

<p>Echidna89

</font>

<p>1) I don't understand the question. Wal-mart stopped selling ALL comics. Not just Knuckles, but ALL.<br>

2) Maybe never, Like I said, not Knuckles, but ALL comics.<br>

3) My guess is Gen-13...:-)

<font size="-1"><b>The truth is out there...</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Dear Sonic people,

<p>Now i just read your origin on robotnik. I got a little problem

with 

that. When i got my first sonic the hedgehog game i got a small

comicbook 

with it. From what i read there Robotnik used to be a good man named

Dr. 

Kintobor. That is what i believed. When the two tv shows and comics

came out 

i bacame confused. So I have some questions.   1.) Which is the real

story? 

(or closest to it) the comedy sonic from "adventures of sonic...", or

the 

more adventurous one from the other show and comics of today?  2.) Can

you 

please tell me the truth about Robutnick!?   I would really appretiate

it if 

you could get back to me on this. Thanks!

<p>SpiderLuke

</font>

<p>The truth is, which one is the main storyline depend on your judgement. Archie fans say theirs is the main one, Sega fans say theirs is the main one. So it all depends on which side you're on.
