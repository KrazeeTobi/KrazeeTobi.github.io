<td><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=-1><b>Sonic Adventure Missing Zones?!?!?</b><br>

<p><font color=red>I'm not sure if you can answer my question but anyway, here I go, is there any hidden zones or levels in Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast . I recently saw some screenshots of Sonic Adventure on other websites and saw pictures like Tails flying towards what looks like the Sky Sanctuary Zone (from Sonic and Knuckles) and Tails running on it . I hope you can help by answering my question.



<p>Thanks,<br>

Sonic fan.</font>

<p>Hopefully, SA won't have missing zones like Sonic 2 did.  It sounds like you're talking about Tails' Factory.  There's a picture of this 'zone' on the Sonic Adventure page.  It turns out that this isn't a zone at all, but it does exist in the game.

<td><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=-1><b>Various Questions</b><br>

<p><font color=red>Hi! I have a few questions:

<p>1. In Sonic 2, Chemical Plant Zone, Act 2, how long can you stay in the mega mack until you get poisoned and drown?<br>

2. In Sonic 3 & Knuckles (Sonic & Knuckles with Sonic 3 attached), what is the secret that lets Hyper Sonic or Hyper Knuckles breathe underwater without a water shield or use a lightning shield underwater?<br>

3. I recently got Sonic the Hedgehog #72 and I saw an image of Dr. Robotnik on page 16. Is it the real Robotnik or a clone?<br>

Kyle Wightman</font>

<p>1. 30 seconds, just like the water.  It takes 5 seconds for the first "ding" warning, and the warning repeats at 10 seconds and 15 seconds. After 18 seconds (or 3 seconds after the 3rd warning), the "danger" music and countdown start. The countdown lasts 12 seconds.<br>

2. I've never heard of that.  My guess is that you have to get either a lightning or bubble shield, then turn Super/Hyper.  That causes the shield to disappear, but you still technically have it.  So that might allow you to keep lightning underwater, and I'm sure it would allow you to breathe underwater.<br>

3. Robotnik is back (as Eggman this time), but we don't know how it's explained.

<td><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=-1><b>Motherload of Questions</b><br>

<p><font color=red>Hi, I'm back with more questions.  A few of them are from an early list of questions that I wasn't able to see the answers to.



<p>1.  Ok, I know that you have to download the Sonic RPG onto your harddrive.  But, is it possible to download it onto a disk and then load it onto your computer?<br>

2.  Before submitting a fan-fic, do you have to go through any kind of legal process with Sega, since Sonic and the majority of other characters are theirs?<br>

3.  Do you think Ken Penders is lame?<br>

4.  Tails and Sally both had their own mini-series.  So, will there ever be follow up mini-series?  I mean, will there be other mini-series starring those two characters?<br>

5.  Will Sega ever make it's own Sonic RPG?<br>

6.  Will there ever be a return of Crocbot, or the introduction of other "Robotnik underbosses?"<br>

7.  I heard that you can buy an import Dreamcast and Sonic Adventure.  Is this true?  If so, roughly how much do each cost?<br>

8.  Why does Sega not want Sonic and Sally to get married?  I mean, how's it going to hurt the image of their mascot?  Marvel comics was never hurt when it allowed the writers of Spiderman to have Peter Parker marry Mary Jane.  So, what's Sega afraid of? 



<p>Thanks. :)</font>

<p>1. Yeah, just save it on the disk.  I'm not sure if a floppy has enough space to hold the unzipped files, but if it does, you should be able to run it.<br>

2. That is a good question, and the answer is complicated.  I really don't kknow what the legal issues are, but fanfic writers usually just put a copyright disclaimer at the beginning of a fic.<br>

3. Um, that depends on who you're asking.  Personally, I'd say no.  I don't own copies of his work, so I'm just judging by what I've seen on his page and board.<br>

4. Hopefully.  tSF has a Tails mini-series petition.<br>

5. Hopefully.  The closest thing we have right now is a rumored "adventure platformer" called Sonic Realms, which, IMHO, sounds better than a traditional RPG.<br>

6. Probably.  Some villains escaped with Crocbot's parts in Sonic #70, and I doubt they included that for nothing.<br>

7. Yes, it's true.  The cost depends on who you buy it from, but it usually seems to be between $400 and $800 for the set of both DC and SA.<br>

8. This may have something to do with image, but I think the main reason is that Sally isn't in the games.  If they did get married in the comics, and a later game introduced Sonic's new girlfriend, someone would be in deep trouble.  They'd either have to kill off Sally, write in a divorce, call the character Sally even if she is nothing like Sally (Amy in Sonic CD, remember?), or admit that the comics follow a different story than the games.

<p><font color=red>Hello, HQ!<br>

Thank god I found your site. It has EVERYTHING. And the Sonic RPG.



<p>I have 2 questions... Sally says to find Ixis Naugas around Knothole... I checked everywhere; the huts, behind trees, searching rocks and fighting in the sand. Is he IN knothole? Or outside? Because there doesnt appear to be a way to get outside the town...



<p>And in the FanFair page, the link to Sonic RPG makes my computer do the "Your computer has done an illegal operation" thing. Is there a second link to the Sonic RPG page somewhere? (This is the reason Im not able to Email the exact programmers for it directly..)



<p>Well, sorry for taking up your time. Any help would be appreciated.<br>

Catch you on the flip side!<br>

~Sonic Boom</font>

<p>There's a bug in the current demo that causes Naugus to disappear when you talk to a certain character.  Start a new game, and only talk to "necessary" characters (Mighty, Ray, Sally, Nack, Shopkeeper).  Once you beat Naugus (who is located on the far side of the lake), you can safely talk to everyone else (Tails, Espio, Rotor, etc.).

Hey I'm back with some more questions.



<p>1. In Knuckles #8, what is the clue that Mougle left for Knux in

Mighty's 

house? Y'know the stuff Knux was looking at on the floor.<br>



2. What are the Chaotix back up stories going to be about.<br>



3. When are Tobor and M.Rex going to confront each other?<br>



4.Is Remington going to appear anytime soon?

<p>Thank You,<br>

<p>1) Knux was just suspecious after both of his friend's houses were destroyed.<br>

2) Ray and Mighty in 26, 27. Then Espio later on.<br>

3) Don't know, most likely after #32.<br>

4) Yes. He'll be in a lot of issues down the road.

1.  To play the Sonic RPG, can i just click on it & play it like a

console 

game or do I have to download it onto my harddrive?

2. Which issues of the Sonic comic featured Packbell?

3. In the window of a local comic shop, I saw a poster that said Silent

Mobius on it in big yellow letters.  It was above some other Archie

published 

comics.  Any idea what this is?



<p>Thanks. Again, I have to say your site is excellent.<br>

</font>



<p>1) It's a computer a game, so all you need to do is download it to your harddrive.<br>

2) None. Packbell is a fan made character.<br>

3) Silent Mobius is actually a manga. For more info, go <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://nucleus.com/~nagatomi/parents/silent.htm">here</a>.

I was thinking, shouldn't you guys update your FAQ file? Esspecially

the

part with the charcters ages. Now onto the questions that will prove my

point: How old is Nate Morgan, Juli-Su, and Elias? I tried to watch the

SatAM movies off of Sirnexcom's site but it didn't work, why not? I

have

RealPlayer! (No offense, I love the site) And, last but not least, I

heard that the Sonic Anime came out in March! What's up with that! I

can't find a place in San Diego, California that sells it, do you guys

have any idea where I can get it? Thanks, you guys are way past way

past

cool!

<p>Julie-su is said to be 15. Elias is older than Sally, who is 15. Nate Morgan is older than Robonik, who we have no clue as to age. We'll have the SatAM realvideos soon. Sonic Anime is gearing for release this September.

HEWWO!!!  Miss me?  Heh!   Okie, more questions, but VERY few this

time!



<p>1. When is Amy Rose's birthday<br>

2. In the fanfiction corner, when you submit a fanfic, do you need to

send in 

a summary of it as well?<br>

3. What time does the Sonic show come on again?  Can't seem to find it

on 

Toon Disney.<br>

4. Does anyone have the translations for the other Sonic Underground

slips 

from 3-8?<br>

5. Is Julie-Su, by any chance, the daughter of Kommistar, and

granddaughter 

of Kragok? (I probably would never know because I'm not buying

Knuckles' 

comics anymore)<br>

6. Would Amy Rose also be in the 3rd season of the Sonic ABC series?

</font>



<p>1) I don't think that was addressed by anyone.<br>

2) No, but if you want, go ahead.<br>

3) I don't think it's still running, better wait for Sonic Underground coming September.<br>

4) Yeah, we'll have more info on the cartoons soon. As we have a UK member now.<br>

5) You'll need to read the future books to find out..:-)<br>

<p>Sega does not make any toys. Rather, you contract other toy prodcers like Bandai to rpoduce their brand. When Sonic Adventure hits later this year, we'll see a lot of Sonic merchandise.
