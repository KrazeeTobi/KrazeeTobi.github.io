<font size="-1"><b>Random thoughts.</b><br>



<p><font color="red">


hmmm, I like the new design for the HQ, thank God you changed the music
into randomize.  
Don't you just wished you would like those japanese animators actually
making an anime version of our archie comics.  
Can you just see how great it is to see the animation quality today in
Japan!!!, looking at the movies of sonic adventure and Sonic the satam
version, you got that feeling,

<p>Those damn SOA better bring us the Sonic RPG if you know what I mean, I
swear If I saw an anime series on Sonic, based on the archie comics, I
would buy the whole damn series right from DVD.

<p>Don't you think at least they would subtitle the sonic adventure game,
like the characters would talk in japanese but we read the subtitle in
English.  WHYYYYY do they have to give out some cheap actors and
actress.  I heard tails and amy are going to be annoying and Sonic will
have one of those girly voices (megaman).

<p>see ya guys later byyeeeee!!!!!

<p>Hey Arthur, long time no see.I think Archie should stay the way they are, but another company should start a game-adaptation comic with anime style art. As for the voice in Sonic Adventure, it's final, noone bu Stolar (and CSK...and SEL) could change that now.

Could you show Sonic sat A.M. series on T.V.? Because I have satelite &
can't see Sonic sat a.m. but I can see the Adventures of Sonic.

<p>Hmm...no can do. Sorry. But we're NOT the official Sonic representation. Email <a href="http://www.sega.com">Sega</a> for that.

I was just curious if there was ever a translation of the instructions for the Japanese games.  If so then can you help
me out in finding them and let me know were to find them.  I need translations for Sonic, and Power Stone.  I would
really appritiate it if you sent me or helped me locate the English Instructions for these games, if they exist?  Thanks.

</font>

<p>There is a <a href="http://sages.ign.com/">Sonic FAQ</a> on the net, but for anything for Powerstone, you'll have to wait for the Dreamcast magazine to come out (August).

Hi Sonic<br>
I have been wanting to email you for
a long time. you and knuckles make 
a great team you know.That would be cool if I could meet you live. But,
you have no time to meet with me and I can't go to you anyway.
I hope you get past all the zones in Sonic history. See ya later.

<p>Sorry to inform you...but, we're in noway related to Sega, and we're not Sonic (he doesn't exist).

I've been looking all over for SatAM in RealMedia. Star Hedeghog's site
is
down, but, while browsing in the FAQ, I chanced upon a question that
said,
roughly "i want to find SatAM in mov or Avi, not RealMedia" a mentions
something about having downloaded SatAM in RealMedia from a placecalled
"Limpcombs". If it's still up, What is the URL?
<p>Andrew

<p>We'll have them VERY soon. And as for Limpcombs, I think that's down as well.

<font size="-1"><b>Time...</b><br>



<p><font color="red">

Here's a question - how do u determine the year in the Sonic Universe.  Is it like the Stardate system on Star Trek or
something?  If anybody can figure it out,  then it'll make an mean proggy and can assist ppl in fanfic,  etc.

<p>Hmm...good question. But there is no clear answer except that Sega and the Sonic Team determines it. You could say that their time is the same as our time. But if that's the case, Sonic would be in his 20s by now.
<p>Ahh..and the Jedi code. I still don't get the first part of it...no emotion?! Wha?
