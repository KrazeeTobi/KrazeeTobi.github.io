<b>Even More Questions</b>
<p><font color=red>I have even more questions:
<p>1.  How can Dimitri be Knuckles's uncle when Dimitri is supposed to be 
hundreds of years old?
<br>2.  I notice that in your fan-fic page, you submit a fan-fic by clicking 
where it says "here."  After that, how do you send it?  I mean, do you attach 
it to an E-mail or what? (I ask because the one I'm working on is saved to a 
disk)
<br>3.  Packbell is Dan Drazen's character, right?  So, one would have to get 
permission from him to use Packbell in a fan-fic, right?
<br>4.  Answering this question may take a while.  I know Jaleel White voiced 
Sonic, and Tim Curry supposedly voiced Snively and Robotnik, so who voiced 
the other characters?
<p>Thanks :)</font>
<p>1. He's Kuckles' great great great great ..... great great great great great uncle.
<br>2. You got it.  Just attach.
<br>3. He was actually made by someone called David Pistone (Bookshire).  I don't think he's still involved with the Sonic Internet, but I think it'll probably be enough to say at the top of your fic that Packbell is copyrighted to David Pistone.
<br>4. Tim Curry voiced King Acorn.  Robotnik's voice was done by voice actor extraordinaire Jim Cummings, who also did the voice of Winnie-the-Pooh in the TV series.  Search on <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://www.imdb.com>IMDB</a> and you'll be able to find the voice cast for SatAM, and even find out what other roles the voice actors have had.

<b>Songs With Attitude</b>
<p><font color=red>Dear Sonic HQ,
<p>When I finally received my Sonic Adventure: Songs with Attitude music CD, I 
noticed something strange about it. In pictures of the album I see online, 
the front of the case shows the five characters and the words Sonic Adventure 
Songs with Attitude Mini Vocal Album. My copy looks the same except where it 
should say Mini Vocal Album, it says ~Vocal+Remix-Album~ instead. Are there 
any differences between the two versions besides that?
<p>Thanks,The Croc</font>
<p>Interesting.  There is a Sonic Adventure Remix CD that contains remixed versions of the character themes.  Maybe you got that instead, or maybe the CD you have has both the originals and the remixes.  If you have just the origiinals, then the CD would only include the same 6 songs that are available as RealAudio in our music section.  If you have more, or if you have multiple versions of the same song, then you have the remixes too.

<b>"Sleepless In Seattle" writes....</b>

<p><font color="red">Didn't you say once on your news that Yuji Naka said that Sega never said 
SegaSonic was on Mobius? If so, then he's wrong because on page one of the 
first Sonic comic ever by anyone (Which was Sega's) it says "Welcome to the 
planet Mobius!". So can you confirm the first sentence and prove him wrong?</font>
<p>To which Sonic HQ replied in email....(with now added WB notes)
<p>I'm sorry, I just can't do that. There are many
reasons, and here are some of them: 
<br>
<br>1) Originally, according to what little we know of SA, Sonic was on Earth
<br>2) Sonic's arch-enemy is called really Dr.Eggman (Japanese - original name by Yuji Naka)
<br>3) Sega Of America's story isn't the most and first original one; they changed it and I don't know why they had to do
that. SoA changed almost everything, Earth/Little Planet to Mobius, Eggman to Robotnik, Sonic's
biography, Fang The Sniper to Nack the Weasel, and bunch of more.
 
<p><font color="red">To which "Sleepless In Seattle" hastily replies....
<p>So they changed them. It doesn't effect my question. Sonic being on
Mobius is still the current home planet, and Eggman being Robotnik and so on.
According to Sonic news@SonicHQ, Yuji Naka said that Sega NEVER said Sonic was on
Mobius and you just pointed out that they did. If it does at all, how does that effect my question?
<p>Sleepless In Seattl.....uhm...Gandalf922@aol.com  ^_^</font>

<p>Actually it effects your question more than you think. I didn't respond to it originally (might have been Vec) but allow me to explain.
What he is trying to say is that SOA has changed Sonic's backstory around more times than underwear on a 5 year old with an explosive bladder. That Sonic comic was the first one, so there are BOUND to be continuity errors in ANY CONTINUITY it fits in (even Fleetway - but I don't read FW so I can't confirm this).
Using it as a basis for your rebuttal won't get you anywhere as its up for nostalgic value alone - and serves to prove SoA can mix ANYTHING up. :P 
As for the Yuji Naka statemnt - perhaps we did say that (I don't know - I havent been on Q&A for quite a bit) but I believe you may be taking it in the wrong context. In Sonic Adventure - Yuji Naka's latest masterpiece - Mr. Naka currently places Sonic on PLANET EARTH, this was said in an interview a LONG time ago. This is the japanese story for SA, Mr. Naka's vision. 
If its on earth now in Japan, theres no way to prove from the SoJ standards or from Mr. Naka that it never took place on earth from Yuji Naka's view before. Now, knowing SoA, because so many Americans are used to seeing Sonic on Planet Mobius, they MAY change that. Maybe not. But for now we have to 
go by what Mr. Naka said in his interview, and nothing more until we see Americas version. Sega has said Sonic lives on Mobius - it just depends on WHICH Sega branch you are talking about. Case closed. ^_^

Finding a cleaner kit for the 32X will be next to IMPOSSIBLE, if not non-existant.
This is a longshot, but I know Toys R' Us has cleaning kits for game consoles. Look there, and if you can't find one to match a 32X, try looking for a Genesis cleaning slot.

<font size="-1"><b>TMK Comment #1 - Rumors In The Wrong Way....</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
<p>Hey Sonic HQ, i dont think you should team up with Mushroom Kingdom.
The reason is, is because Sonic and Mario are enimes i mean i think mario
is cool 
and all, its just not the same with a mario and sonic site, i think
that 
mario site is excellent its just i like Sonic HQ how it is, and i hope
it can 
stay like that.. a non mario site. Well i hope it doesnt happen, and i
really 
like both sites, but i like sonic way more. well seeya layter

<p>-Mikey K</font>

<p>
This is what I consider a nice sensible opinion. Thank you Mikey for your input. This letter - along with three more that I will place on down the line are only parts of the comments that we got
on the Mushroom Kingdom Poll this weekend. I'll start by saying that it was this letter that prompted us to put up our reasons for WHY the affiliation was being thought of as well as to have taken place.
In case you didn't catch it - you can find our reasons behind the whole thing <a href=/sonichq/emuzone/test/affiliation.html>here</a>. The general consensus seemed that most people thought that we were turning Sonic HQ into a SONIC AND MARIO SITE and that TMK and SHQ would completely merge.
This is not true and we're sorry some got that implication. The deal was simply that they help to promote us, we help to promote them. We hold joint contests (which we think will prove to be fun) and will overall
benefit both pages. We're familiar with the ups AND downs to this, but we think we can pull it off. We haven't failed you before and don't plan on doing it now. Sonic HQ will FOREVER STAY a ALL SONIC SITE and nothing else. Thank you for bringing that
out into the open Mikey for us to notice before it was too late. Now for something completely different....

<font size="-1"><b>TMK Comment #2 - <u>Constructive</u> Negative Feedback</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
<p>What are you crazy? It would be like putting Luke Skywalker on the same
team 
as Darth Vader!!!!!!!! I mean there is nothing beneficial that could come from it(And even if
there 
was, come on!).</font>
<p> We've thoroughly weighed the ups and downs. You may not think we are, but we are very sure of what good AND BAD could come out of this situation.
We, along with TMK, want to make this work, not based off of some stupid system wars, but the fact that we want Sonic and videogaming in particular to realise that sometimes its NOT just 
about a mascot, but gameplay and overall fun. And if you can't have fun making a webpage or a playing a videogame, then why bother? :o) If people see two videogame sites where fans of both genre have ALWAYS BICKERED over who is better, then WE HOPE that
people will take note, that sometimes all it takes is a little friendship. An extended hand in a simple handshake can often do much better if that hand doesnt always contain a knife. :)</font>
<p><font color="red">Why do you think Sega doesn't make a Mario game or Nintendo a Sonic
game? </font>
<p>Maybe because they are two different companies? We know this already. But you're looking too deeply into something thats not there.
Its nothing but promotion and contests and fun. Is there anything wrong with having fun or trying to promote a webpage? EVERYONE does it - Why can't we? Because its Mario? Maybe. But they call BOTH a "game" for a reason.
:O) </font>
<p><font color="red">To consider what you are considering is almost as bad as doing what you
are considering. Just think about the situation for a minute(Maybe it'll help you
comprehend 
what your about to do), There are two universes, totally separate,
totally 
different, each wanting nothing from the other, each wondering how the
people 
in the other universe can stand being in the other. But some maniac
wants to 
create a wormhole to the other but can't without the help of the other,
so 
the other starts to seriously consider helping the first create the
wormhole. 
Therein comes the irony! </font>
<p>Just so you'll know. WE weren't the ones that originally began this.
It began while we were in a chat and we (ALONG WITH THE TMK webmaster) were playfully joking about it.
But then we began to consider it and the full implications of what this could do for both pages. So this is all not some half cocked idea that HQ came up with totally out of the blue.
TMK is and did do and are planning to do thier part in wanting to do this as well. We ARE NOT trying to merge the universe, but all we are doing is extending a hand of friendship. And I personally find 
nothing wrong with that. To tell you truth - the furthest you will even EVER SEE THIS AFFILIATION on HQ is no more than a link, and a totally separate page you will see on yahoo later. Beyond the occasional joint contest (which WON'T affect content in ANY WAY) nothing more than that will ever take place. 
But hey - like thats my opinion, you voiced opinion as well. And we wouldn't have asked for it if we didn't want it. :O)
<p><font color="red">You've got one of the best Sonic sites out there and you're just going
to throw it down the drain pulling a stupid stunt like that!
Do what you may, I have no say, but just remember, the Sonic fans will
be disappointed, the Mario fans will be awed and humored.
<p>-Gandalf922@aol.com</font>
<p>To tell you the truth, we thought long and hard about even thinking of putting up that poll, and had no idea that we'd get as many yays and nays we did. It wouldn't have been fair to just up and do it anyway. So we decided to let the fans
of Sonic and visitors of SonicHQ to decide. The fans decided - and the majority voted yes. Results are posted here for everyone to view. The staff had NO PART in voting other than collecting data. If the majority voted yes in dissapointment, 
then I think they showed thier dissapointment the wrong way. Don't you think? However they _did_ vote yes - and I think that shows that the majority trusts us to enough that they think we know what we are doing. And I for one thank those who have that much faith in us. We haven't dissapointed before, sent no reason for us to make you think we would, and we don't plan on dissapointing now.
I've talked to some Mario fans as well and they seem to think the same thing. And if some Mario fans are shallow enough to be humored, then let them be humored. We're not out to humor anybody, just extend out a hand of friendship JUST LIKE <u>THEY</u> extended a hand of friendship with us.
<p>Thank you for your opinions Gandalf. Believe it or not, we heard EVERY WORD everyone said. Yays and nays. Thank you for being one to truly voice your opinion. We appreciate that. :O) </font>

<font size="-1"><b>TMK Comment #4 - And Hence Came The Flamer...</b><br>
<p><font color="red">Considering SonicHQ can't even spell Mushroom properly should you really be considering working with Mushroom Kingdom? Seriously now, there are far too many banners already on the site. Is this Sonic HQ or Banners HQ? The LAST thing we want is more stupid banners. 
This is a Sonic site we don't want MARIO. 
<p>-Blackfin</font>

<p>Point A - Our guestbook is there for comments, critiques and such ON SONIC HQ. We look at the guestbook frequently and consider what everyone says there (as you will see later in this reply), HOWEVER the guestbook was NOT the place to discuss TMK. Thats why we provide our email address. Use it please. We have it there for a reason.
Point B: Mashroom Kingdom - Its called a "typo", anyone can make it. Any mistake can get by. _NO ONE IS PERFECT_. We don't claim to be, never have, and we know we make mistakes. If we do make one we don't mind you telling us, but we'd appreciate it if you remembered that we're not the dieties of Sonicdom and to err is often human. Any man can make an error.
No offense, but you seemed to get pretty "blech" about a typo that was corrected BEFORE you sent off your post in the guestbook. (I didn't put up the typo, but I DID correct it before you posted - a full couple of hours before in fact). Point C - You've read the Mario stuff perhaps. I won't repeat it here for space, but if you still feel we're doing a wrong we DO
thank you for your opinion. We wouldn't have asked nor put up the poll if we didn't want it and value it. Thank you. :o) And to repeat one last time SONIC HQ is NOT adding Mario to our pages, we're only working with another page in promotion. And thats ALL WE HAVE TO SAY on TMK for now.
<p>Lastly - I had to address this seperately, as this was a more valid comment: And this was the banners. Perhaps you missed our update on this, but better the one banner on the front page, bottom of games, and bottom of comics, than to have the endless popups we once had months ago, back on geocities. And I think EVERYONE finds those horrid things annoying.
Be GLAD we don't have to add banners to the top of games and comics as well. Emulation Zone was nice enough to let us use thier space and get away with that, so you just have to deal with it along with everyone else. As a requirement, we had to place a banner on the top of the front page. We know you don't like it, but there is NOTHING we can do about it....for now. 
From now on we ask that NO ONE comment on the banners anymore. We CAN'T do anything about it for now, so comments on it are basically moot until we can. We will be working to resolve this soon, but for now you have to just live with it, and if you don't like it, then sorry. :P

<font size="-1"><b>And Now For Something Completely Different - Questions from Liverpool!</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
<p>Hey, I've got a few questions. Please answer them as a treat for me
completing my A-Level exams today!</font>
<p>As you wish! ^___^ </font>
<p><font color="red">1) Is it likely that if and when Sonic and Sally eventually get back
together that they will adopt Tails? I like to think so - he's closer to
them than his reclusive family!</font> 
<p>I seriously doubt that an "adoption" would happen. Personally, I'd like to see Sonic's family in the comics adopt Tails sorta, until we find out what became of his real parents.
But then - that can't happen due to Sonic 74...Its true that Tails is closer to the FF's, but most likely, the comics will keep it at a "best friend/big brother" status. Which is the way it always has been.</font>
<p><font color="red">2) Is there any way for us English to subscribe to the US comic?</font>
<p>Sorry U.K. Guys. Egmont-Fleetway Comics has the official liscense for Sonic in England. So Archie cant solicit in that country. The only way you can get them is from a comic store that will be willing
to order the Archie comic for you. It doesn't sound as impossible as it may seem as I know some U.K.ers that do this, and greatly prefer Archie to the dwindling Fleetway. The drawback - Back Issues are almost non existant for you all.
Your best bet for back issues is the Sonic checklist in the comics and The Comics Trade Forum on the HQ Store section. Trade some Fleetways for back issue Archies. Plently of American fans would like to see a few...
<p><font color="red">3) What is King Acorn's first name?</font>
<p>Maxmillian, or Max. But nowadays: most fans like to call him sh**head. ^___^
<p><font color="red">4) How many members of the wolf pack have been given names and what are
they? </font>
<p>Check out the Comics Page "Who's Who" section under Miscellaneous Profiles for more info on them. Thier names are Lupe, Leeta, Lyco, Canus, Diablo, and Reynard. The two human children are Ariel and Athena.
<p><font color="red">5) Are there any plans to resurrect the 'Sally' cartoons or are we all
lumbered with that dreadful 'Sonic Underground'? </font>
<p>You bet it sister. Between AoSTH on Toon Disney, and SU to premiere this fall, Sonic SatAM's future looks bleak unless people MASS WRITE Toon Disney or Cartoon Networks Toonami to get teh program.
Both are looking for new shows. DRENCH thier emails in requests. We'll provide that info on our new cartoons page coming soon.
<p><font color="red">6) Archie won't include the stupid concepts from Sonic Underground (Ie,
Manic and Sonia, psuedo rock-music), will they??!</font>
<p>Archie is trying thier hardest not to. Ken Penders stated a while back that the only tie in to SU they'll have for now is just SSS10, which promotes the cartoon (sans edict from Sega Of America). The only way they'll incorporate more SU ideas is if the cartoon grows to be extremely popular and comic fans request it as well as Sega demanding it. Segas being lenient handed for now, but if the show becomes a hit...we may not have seen the last of Manic and Sonia past SSS10...Till then, it remains an alternate universe off the Cosmic Interstate in the comics.
