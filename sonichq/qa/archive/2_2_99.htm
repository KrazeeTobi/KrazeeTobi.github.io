<font size="-1"><b>Silver Sonic in Sonic 2 Death Egg Zone</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Can you tell me what moves the metal sonic does in Death Egg Zone (ex. over, under, over with spikes, etc...) I am having some troubles with that. That a lot. Thanks a million<br>
Aaron
</font>
<p>Okay, here's the order of the moves, starting from the right side of the screen:<br>

1. Spin across floor. <-<br>
2. Standing dash to the right, then back to the left.<br>
3. Jump -><br>
6. Spin <-<br>
7. Spin -><br>
8. Jump <- with spikes shooting<br>
9. Dash<br>
10. Jump -><br>
11. Spin <-<br>
12. Spin -><br>
13. Jump <-<br>
14. Spin -><br>
15, Dash<br>
16, Spin <-<br>
17. Jump -><br>
18. Jump <- with spikes shooting<br>

Repeat from 1, but with the directions switched, since you're starting on the left.<p>

(The Standing Dash is a great time to attack.  If you do a spin dash, Silver Sonic will go right though you, and take damage, while you will be unharmed.)

<font size="-1"><b>Sonic's Origin</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
I want to know who thought of Sonnic the Hedgehog?<br>
John K. again
</font>
<p>Naoto Oshimo created Sonic the Hedgehog, or at least his design and species.<p>

"<i>In 1991, Hayao Nakayama, the chairman of Sega, decided to develop a mascot that would do for his company what Mickey Mouse had done for Walt Disney: personify Sega with a universally-recognized icon. Most of his designers submitted drawings of hopping animals such as kangeroos and rabbits, but Nakayama settled on Naoto Oshimo's stylized hedgehog, and Sonic The Hedgehog was born.</i>"<br>

<font size="-1"><b>General Questions</b><br>
<p><font color="red">
Hello, just a few questions if ya don't mind.<p>

1.  Ra, Rm files and stuff like that are totally different from MP3's so why does simplenet have a problem with the Sat AM videos?<p>

2.  This is actually a comment that I just have to say from experience.  Geocities does not always work.  They suck and they are down 45% of the time which is way too much.  At least, when I was there they were.<p>

3.  I keep having these weird reoccurring dreams where I'm in Robotropolis and about to be robotosized. Then, of all the stupid things to happen, Snively saves me.  Any idea what they mean?<p>

4.  What exactly are you looking for in your links page?  Do you like
creativity or what?<p>

Soneec<p>

(I mainly just thought you'd get a kick out of #3 I don't expect a real
answer
so don't think I'm stupid or anything)
</font>
<p>1. I'm not sure if they do.  The Sonic Corner never got a warning from Simplenet.  The files were removed voluntarily in order to prevent any trouble.  SEGASonic.net was shut down for having a tiny collection of MP3s, but they're back and still have their AoStH videos.  I really have little knowledge of what happened at Star Hedgehog's Page, because the first time I saw it was after they were rebuilt, minus SatAM.  I looked at the page's message board, and the site apparently did have some problems with Simplenet, but they still have other videos, so I don't know what happened.<p>

2. I can't comment because I've never maintained a Geocities site.<p>

3.  Actually, you're not the only one.  For the month before Sonic 2 came out, I had dreams every other night about finding a store that had somehow leaked a copy from SEGA.<br>

I think the fact that Snively saved you is understandable.  Personally, when SatAM was on, I always thought Snively would end up joining the Freedom Fighters.  It just seemed that they were setting him up to be converted into a good guy.<p>

4.  I can't speak for the other reviewers, but I can describe the way I ranked them.  I looked at each site and wrote down a summary of what it had.  I gave extra attention to things that were unique to that site, or that were relatively rare.  For common stuff like Fan Art, Fan Fics, Profiles, SA pics, Anime pics, Comic Scans, etc., I graded them mostly on quantity, and occasionally for the quality of a few samples I had seen.  Also, for example, a site with 30 well-described and categorized pics got more Fan Art credit than a site with over 100 pics that were just left in a directory somewhere with no descriptions, thumbnails, or anything.  Ease of navigation and appearance also influenced my opinion.<br>

I ranked them all in a list from first to last.  When there seemed to be several sites relatively close in quality, I grouped them together and gave them the same score.  If a site got a 15, for example, it was because I felt it was approximately 1 point below the 16s and 1 point above the 14s.  A lot of sites jumped from group to group as I compared them, but I eventually became pretty sure where they all went.  There were a number of sites that got x.5 ratings, but I finally decided to round down the ones that were no longer updated and round up the rest.

I got all the emeralds but I can't be super sonic. How do you do it?
</font>
<p>The Chaos Emeralds only allow you to become Super Sonic in Sonic 2 (jump with 50+ rings) and Sonic 3 & Knukles (do an Insta-Shield with 50+ rings).<br>  If you're playing Sonic 3 & Knuckles and you've already finished Launch Base, Super Sonic is no longer available (unless for some reason you skipped the giant glowing ring) and you'll have to get all 14 emeralds and become Hyper Sonic.

besides the front covers<br>

<p>1. Old age in Sonic #19.<p>

2. See Sonic: In Your Face special. She got it from Julia.<p>

3. She got it in Sonic: IYF. She doesn't always bring it with her in the comic.<p>

4. Enerjak<p>

5. The wolfpack freedom fighters are Reynard, Diablo, Canus, Lupe, and two others I can't remember.  Lupe is the oldest.<p>

6. She's from Downunda, other members are Walt, Barby, Wombat-stu, and Duck "Bill".<p>

7. SEGASonic the Hedghog (an Arcade game released in 1993 in Japan) featured 3 playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo, and Ray the Flying Squirrel.  Sonic was the fastest, Mighty was the strongest, and Ray was the most acrobatic.  Ray is yellow and brown and has a very fast glide.  Apparently, in Japan, Mighty and Ray are a team like Sonic and Tails. Ray will be introduced in Knuckles #26 and will then join the Chaotix.<p>

8. It's the style of the artist.  The various Sonic characters were designed by 3 different companies (SEGA, DiC, Archie) and by different artists within those companies.<p>

9. The character you're talking about is Mighty the Armadillo.  He's supposed to be as strong as Sonic is fast, so that means he's probably stronger than Bunnie, since few machines can match Sonic's speed.  Besides that, Bunnie isn't all machine.  However, since metal is sturdy, Bunnie can probably use her strength for longer amounts of time than Mighty can.<p>

10. Well, she's nice, and often clever.  She also has martial arts skills.  Her robotic limbs can extend and Rotor sometimes adds upgrades to them to give Bunnie more abilities.<p>

11. Mello Bee, Eddy the Yeti, Robotnik<p>

12. The force is with him...aways....<p>

13. Don't worry, Archie has said that they are going to try to prevent Underground from affecting the comic.<p>

We have a Fan Art section.  And non-cover comic scans are available on the old Comic Info Page, so they should be up on the new one eventually.

Your news page is still tempoarliy down (when this is being written),
so I was
wondering what is the URL to the site with the SatAM Real Player
episodes
since I can't get to the archive.  Also, when are the remaining pages
going to
be tranferred from Geocities? Some new thing with my browser (IE) is not
allowing them to be connected to.  Speaking of music, whatever happened
to the
MIDI's "South Island" from the anime page and "Let There Be Light" from
the
compositions page?<br>
- J Weekley
</font>
<p>Because of Simplenet server rules, basicly all the SatAM real video were taken down by the Sonic sites. So you won't find it anywhere now...We're moving as fast as we can, the Music page is being moved for this whole week. I don't know about you not being able to connect to Geocities, because they work all the time. For the mids, you'll have to wait for the new page to be up.
