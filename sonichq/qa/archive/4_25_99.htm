SonicHQ-



<p> Hi! I visit your site almost everyday! LUV IT! I was wondering, 

everyone's asked it, no one has answered it, and I'm asking u-- where 

can I get a Knuckles plushie??? They DO exist--check it out on your 

Trade forum under the name "The Most saught after item of all" Now THAT 

is a good looking plushie. I wonder... would you mind putting it on

your main page? I'm sure SOMEONE has got to have the info!!! THanks 4 your 

time. Keep up the awsome work!!! ^_^

</font>

<p>Thanks for the compliment!



<p>Well, we don't know where to find it, but any plushie news will show up in the FAQ once we get it.  That main page idea may actually work.

Hi, I have a few questions about Sonic HQ<br>

1. How many people have visited your site?<br>

2. Will the comic page be updated every month instead of every 6?

<p>Sean McConnell

</font>

<p>1. We have no way to know how many individuals have seen Sonic HQ, but the counter on the main page records the number of visits.<br>

2. The new Comic Info page has been under construction since late March.  However, it isn't finished yet, and that's why we haven't revealed it.

<p><font color="red">

why is sonic so cool, and in your 'who's who?' bit, why does it say that sonic calls tails: 'little brother'?  instead of: 'little buddy'?



<p>yours questionlingly, martyn jasinski

</font>

<p>1. Coolness is not usually something that can be described easily, and different people have different reasons to call something cool.  I would point out Sonic's cool design, the unique cubist/surreal graphical style, great music, an interesting cast of characters, and the fact that you can either run through the zones or explore them in detail.<br>

2. Because Sonic has an "older brother" relationship with Tails.  I'll have to ask WB to be sure, but I think that's what Sonic calls Tails in Japan.  Either that, or it was a bit of interpretation.

I would like to know if I can buy a sonic doll and some posters for my

walls. 

 Do you think dreamcast will make a sonic's hits game, I'm just worried

that 

they will only make one sonic game.   I bought the Saturn and all the

sonics 

games only.  i guess you can say I'm practicing.   can i subscribe to

sonic 

comics through you.     i put your web page on my favs    keep up the

great 

work

<p>Sega will have tons of Sonic and Dreamcast related materials on sale later this year.

<p>Sega has several Sonic projects in the works. Rumors say Sonic R 2, Sonic Realms, and Sonic Underground. Another Sonic game is coming to the handheld SNK NeoGeo Color, not much is known about that yet. For the latest info, check our news page.

<p>Subscribing comics through us? Hmm...we'll have to think about that one. But most likely no unless you live outside of N. America, as you can subscribe cheaper through Archie themselves.

Hi, I have 3 more questions:

<p>1.  I know now that those red eyes belong to Naugus, but if they had

proceeded with the series altogether, would they have eventually put

Knuckles in it, or some other Sonic video game-originated characters?

<p>2.  Isn't Knuckles suppose to have connected eyes like Sonic's? I've

seen

him with those in several places, including the cartriage to Sonic 3.

<p>3.  About those conflicting stories...If the Sonic anime is going to be

out

this fall, is there any month or date of release yet?( I personaly

think

that it's out right now, just not officialy and it's in very few video

stores and that it actually will be released officialy this fall in all

video stores that sell anime. This is just what I think because it

would

make sense out of those conflicting stories.)

<p>Tariq Bhatti

</font>

<p>1) Yes, Knuckles was suppose to appear in the 3rd season.<br>

2) No, Knuckles is suppose to have 2 seperate eyes.<br>

3) Sonic Anime is rumored to be out and rumored to be coming out late August, right before Sonic Adventure. We really have no idea which is true, but your theory might be correct.

<p><font color="red">

I'm back guys!  Bet you thought you'd got rid of me.  Well, here're my

q's.

<p>1. What's up with Dulcy?  Where has she been lately, and where will she be lately?<br>

2. Do you agree with the move of Nack to the Knux series.  I don't. :(<br>

3. We will ever see some character developement for my fav villain, Predator Hawk?

<p>Well, see ya!

<p>SonIXcool

</font>

<p>1) Dulcy is still alive, just been pushed around by the new characters...such as Nate. But she's still alive.<br>

2) Noone said he's going to be moved permanently, and what's wrong with it? I mean, ever heard of crossovers? Nack is a crossover character, he belong to both comics.<br>

3) Not likely.

Dear Sonichq,

<p>Here is my question......

<p>1. I know two places that have the sonic anime movies downloadable,

but for some reason their links aren't working.  Will you guys ever

post movie files of the anime, or do you know of any other places that

might have them?

<p>PS:  Wouldn't it be great if Archie made a mature sonic for once? 

That's what most of us teen sonic fans want to see.

<p>-Bill

</font>

<p>1) Yes we will, eventually, see, right now a few of us are quiet busy with school, and the updates are a bit disorganized, but we'll settle things once some of us hit break.

<p>P.S. I think Ken Penders is trying to make Knuckles one. And yes, it would be great, but don't bet on it to happen.

Dear Sonic Q&A,<br>

I guess my questions got deleated so here they are again.

<p>1. Are the DL coming back anytime soon?<br>

2. Besides Charmy, Do any of the Chaotix have siblings?<br>

3.Are Valdez and Espio related?<br>

4.Is Kommisar ( that DL chick in Kn #22-24) Kragok's dauter? I mean she calls Rex 'grandfather'.<br>

5. What is Remmington's Secret that Bennidick was going to reveal? Will we ever know in the comic?

6. When are Wyn and Lara getting married, are they going to show it in the comic?

<p>Thank you,<br>

00dodger

<p>P.s,-Happy Birthday for the site. May it have many more!

</font>

<p>1) If Knuckles ever gets to #50, yes (hint, hint).<br>

2) Not known at the moment, so we'll say no.<br>

3) Nope. <br>

4) That we'll eventually find out, possibly soon, since she's captured and ready for questioning.<br>

5) Yes, but looking at the time table, not very soon.<br>

6) Oh, yes, in a big way too, I think I reported in the news that it'll be in the #40s.

<p>P.S. Thanks man! And we'll have more, mark my word...see, we're a staff site, unlike others. So we could let younger people take over when older people get disattached.
