<b>How do you make those videos?</b>
<p><font color=red>On various Sonic the Hedgehog-related pages, including Sonic HQ, The Sonic Foundation, and Knothole Express, I have observed downloads of images, sounds, RealVideo episodes, AVI (Video for Windows) movies, etc.  However, I really have wondered how the downloads of the Saturday morning episodes (SatAM) were created--that is, how does one actually manage to put images, sounds, RealVideo clips, and movies of an animated cartoon for television?  This inquiry poses quite a puzzle to me, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would clarify this matter.   Feel free to explain your answer in somewhat technical detail, since I am quite computer literate, my knowledge ranging from simple computer operations to computer programming in the languages of BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) and Visual Basic.  (I also have had a sprinkling of experience with JavaScript.)  However, please keep in mind that I have had no experience in creating sound or video files (including RealVideo), nor any expert experience with image editing.  (I can use an image-editing utility such as Paint or Paint Shop Pro to create or edit existing pictures.)   </font>
<p>Hm, sorry to tell you this, but I have <I>no</I> clue! You see, we didn't even create those videos. We got them (yes, with permission ^__^ ) from another site. All I know is it requires some sort of special video cable. Sorry!

<b>The Story of Chaos</b>
<p><font color=red>I have a question related to the storyline of  Sonic Adventure:   I don't understand the story behind Chaos, the Master Emerald, and Tikal.  Can you please explain it to me? Thanks!   p.s: you guys have a great website!  </font>
<p>Ok- Chaos was a protector of the Chao Babies and the Master Emerald (See? They <I>do</I> have something to do with the storyline!). Soon, Tikal's father and his minions went to take control of the Master Emerald's power, but when they tried to do so- Chaos appeared. Chaos then took the power of all seven Chaos Emeralds, and became Perfect Chaos. Then, Perfect Chaos destroyed civilization as they knew it. After the destruction, Tikal (somehow) trapped Chaos as well as herself inside the Master Emerald, and you know they were in there until disturbed by Dr. Robotnik. So, it's kinda complicated. Thanks for your compliments!

<b>Ages of the Freedom Fighters</b>
<p><font color=red>As of what year were all the Sonic cast the age they are now? And in your  profiles can you include Ashura the Hedgehog? Please? </font>
<p>First, to clarify, here are the ages of the major Freedom Fighters:<BR> Sonic: 16<BR> Tails: 10<BR> Sally: 15<BR> Bunnie: 14<BR> Antoine: 18<BR> Amy Rose: 10 (Or now, 12)<P>  These ages are correct as of the Mobian year 3235.<P>  As far as Ashura goes, just talked with Vector and he says maybe. He's organizing a script, and it depends on how it goes. But thanks for pointing that one out.

<p><font color=red>please help can you give me details of retail outlets in the u.k where i can get sonic games for the 16bit sega megadrive.   </font>
<p>Hm, I don't live in the UK, so I wouldn't know exactly. Do you get Funcoland in the UK? They re-sell older games, so there's a good place. If you're lucky, you may find something on Amazon.com, apparently they might have some! Good luck!-Joey

<b>Problems with SatAM Videos!</b>
<p><font color=red>i'm having trouble with the SatAM realplayer files found on this page (which  i was looking EVERYWHERE for).  they start playing and then freeze after a  few seconds.  each video always stops in the same place.  i didn't think the  files could be corrupt because i've downloaded and used them before (before  i crashed my comp), so i downloaded a new version of realplayer but that  didn't help.  do you know what's wrong??  thanks!  and thank you for putting  up those files!   jen  </font>
<p>Hm, good question Jen, but we're stumped. It works OK for me, but I do have a cable modem, so I don't know how it is for you. WB suggests downloading them onto you're hard drive, then playing them there. Hope it works!-Joey

<b>Sonic Eco-Themes</b>
<p><font color=red>hi I love your site. GREAT WORK! anyway I have a question I was recently reading an archie sonic the hedgehog comic issue #71 and it showed that sonic turned to super sonic, ultra sonic and solar sonic? then he could turn into polar sonic or eco sonic? who are all these sonics? could you please straighten out how sonic's evoluntions go? and how he gets to  become them?<br> thanks fan</font>
<p>Other than Super Sonic, all the others are just a bunch of Sonic forms made up for issue #71 of the Archie Sonic Comic.  Well, Ultra had appeared before, but not the others.  It seems that these multiple transformations are meant to be an explanation for Sonic's having green eyes.  The transformations apparentlly depend on the ecosystem in which Sonic is running.

<b>SatAM Tapes</b>
<p><font color=red>Since there seem to be so many of us searching to complete (or begin) our  Sonic tape collections, could you guys open up a tape trade center? I've got some tapes for trade, and I've been trying for a long time to find the rest of the SatAm's. Yes, there's RealVideo, but many of us would be grateful to be able to connect with other people to obtain tapes to watch in full quality on a full-size TV.</font>
<p>Try the Sonic Trade Forum.  It's in the Sonic Store, and on the Sonic HQ Forums page.

<p> Ok, Toys R' Us <B>may</B> still have a few Genesis (Megadrive) games, and if they do, Sonic 3 would probably be one. Another good place is probably Ebay.com. I bet you could get a copy for a few bucks!

<p><font color=red>Hi! I have a question about the new TV show, Sonic Underground. In one episode I saw, Knuckles makes an appearance. Does he or the  Chaotix make any other apperances?</font>
<p>Knuckles is involved in 3 episodes.  You can find out more at <a href=http://www.sonicunderground.net target=_whole>http://www.sonicunderground.net</a>.  The Chaotix haven't made an appearance in any episodes produced so far.  Otherwise, I would watch the show! ^_^
