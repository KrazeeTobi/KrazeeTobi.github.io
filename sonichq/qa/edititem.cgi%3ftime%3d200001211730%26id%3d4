<p>Response:<br><textarea name=answer rows=15 cols=75>We don't know how many Chaos Emeralds there are, but there seem to be multiple ;quotation;sets;quotation; of 7, and occasionally 6 or 8.  Knuckles guards the Master Emerald, which is a huge emerald that keeps the Floating Island floating in the air.  There are also Super Emeralds, which seem to be regular emeralds that have grown larger due to their proximity to the Master Emerald.
