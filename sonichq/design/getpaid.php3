I just found this one, and it appears to be the best of the bunch.  It's an AllAdvantage-style bar, but instead of making a set rate and restrictions on its use, they just give you 50% of whatever they make from your ads.  I've just used it for 1 day, but I haven't found a drawback to this one.<p>

$20 - $150 per hour for surfing?  Well, sorta.  This service is extremely well-designed and non-obtrusiive.  You only see ads when you want - it runs in ythe system tray and tells you when one is available.  Just look at the interactive ad for 30 seconds and you'll be credited with about as much money as you'd get for 1-3 hours on AllAdvantage.  You get 13% for direct referrals and 7% for indirect referrals.  Apparently, the referrals only go 2 levels deep, but with the large amount of money they're offering, that isn't surprising.  The drawback of this service is that it doesn't seem to give me ads very often.  :P  If they attract more advertisers, this one could be very useful.  It seems to be a pretty stable program though, so I just keep it running anyway.<p>

The best-known net pay service, but also one of the lowest-paying.  A bar appears on your screen and displays ads.  Their main advantage is that they pay now - the other services are just getting started, while AllAdvantage is established has already sent checks to many people.<p>

<u>"Get Paid" Reviews</u><p>In case you haven't heard already, there are numerous services out there that pay you to see their ads on the net.  Some pay you to surf, some to chat, and some even for just using their site.  The basic idea is to run one of these while you're doing what you normally do to get a bit of extra money every month.<p>It takes a while to figure out which are the best, as there are quite a few out there, and many of them aren't worth the bother.  So Instead of putting annoying banners for them all over the site like you'll see on some sites :P I'm making a page that compares them.  Bascally, this is supposed to be a way to use referral links with dignity.  :P
