			Seperation - by NerfDude

	I must say this - without Robotnik, the comic ain't the same. 
Sure, I figured the "politics" thing'd be cool. But, it's not about 
that now. Now it's stupid Sonic 'n Tails adventures, not unlike the 
"Adventures of...." series. That's a bad thing. When Robotnik was 
around, there were crusades against him; attacks into his lair. Awesome! 
Now, Sonic and Tails have been seperated from the rest of the Freedom 
Fighters, and roam Mobius aimlessly, searching for Naugus (BTW, he went 
through the Winged Victory's propellor! He should be DEAD!)
	Simply put, Robotnik was the bond between Sonic and the rest of 
the Freedom Fighters. 
	Sonic isn't a politics person; so, he has been seperated from 
the Gang to search out Naugus. Now, I ask, what are the chances of him 
finding Naugus?! He's a SHAPE SHIFTER! It would be virtually impossible 
to find him. 
	I don't get it.
	But, this seperation opens a world of new plots. The ones so far 
have sucked - especially that Horizontal and Vertical issue - and I 
doubt they will get better. Someone said Robotnik would return in a few 
months - that figures. Can't kill people in an Archie comic, can we? 
This means that Sonic will probably make a grand return to Mobotropolis.
	Someone said that Sonic and Sally would get married. WHAT?! 
That's crazy talk. Marital satus don't work in this, especially with 
Sonic. 
	But, according to King Acorn, it is necessary to be married to 
obtain the throne. However, the King also refuses to allow Sonic and 
Sal to get married in the first place.
	The claims made by that person just don't work.
	In conclusion, this volcano, if you will, of lies, rumors, and 
screwy, unended plots would never have happened if Robotnik hadn't 
"died".
