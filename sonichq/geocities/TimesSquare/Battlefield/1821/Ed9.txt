                   Couples: by Joya Nappo

	A know a lot of people who are against the idea 
about Bunnie and Antoine being a couple.  It's obvious 
that they're probably going to be married in issue #100. 
I for one don't really like this idea at all. So, here 
some couple ideas that I think might work out.

 	Rotor & Bunnie: Now these guys would make the 
perfect pair!  Heck even in the cartoon Bunnie had a crush 
on Rotor, and vice versa.   Also, if you read Bookshire's 
stories, Rotor and Bunnie are a couple.  So, why not have 
Rotor & Bunnie as boyfriend and girlfriend?  Also, Bunnie in
the show, even called Rotor a 'little genius'!  

 	Antoine & Hershey: I think these guys have more in 
common!  Antoine is a coward, and pretty much doesn't have 
any speical abilities, and the same goes for Hershey, a 
little bit.  Also, Hershey doesn't even have a boyfriend 
yet.   I think these guys would make a better couple.  

 	As for Sonic and Sally, I have hope that they will 
get back together, and also, Knuckles and Julie-Su will 
probably become a couple, too. Sometimes I wish the Knuckles 
20 Years Later special would come earlier!
