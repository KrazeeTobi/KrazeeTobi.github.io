                   Mother's Day -- by Maric

	Well......Mother's day is coming up and everyone will 
be  spending it with the one person that we all know and love 
is "Mom".

	But unfortunaly for our favorite characters from Sonic 
may not be able to enjoy the festivities.

	For instance Ducly would not probably spend it with her 
mother on account that she was captured and roboticized by
Robotnik, which got me thinking, if she was then why wasn't she 
with the rest of the roboticized Mobians? Maybe Robotnik made her 
a sub-boss and put her in some far away land, like he did to the 
General.

	Tails would like to spend Mother's day with his mother, 
but he doesn't even who she is nor what she'd looked like.

	We don't know what happened to Antoine's, Sally's and 
Bunnie's mothers. Maybe they lost them during the great war.

	And I believe Sonic would love spend Mother's day with 
his mom, if he wasn't busy looking for Naugus. Oh well.....maybe
next year.

	Rotor would love to spend Mother's day with his mom, but 
unfortunatly, she's currently unavaible. No pun intended. Ever
since Robotnik had her and the herd brainwashed.
