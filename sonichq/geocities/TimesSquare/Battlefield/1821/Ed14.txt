             The New Team -- By Zifei

	In Archie Sonic issue #62, a new permanent 
artist/penciler team was formed. The writer is Karl
Bollers, and the artist is Steven Butler. This 
editorial will look in depth at the ways the new team
will effect the Sonic comic.

	First off, I want to say that I am very much
in favor of this move by the people at Archie. This
move will allow a better plot with less plot holes
caused by the change of writers every issue. This move
will also allow constant good artwork if the artist is 
good (Manny Galan for Knuckles).

	Speaking of the new artist...Steven Butler, 
what can I say? He's the best Sonic artist to show up
since Patrick Spaziante. And I'm not kidding. Check
out his art from Sonic #61 and #62. This talented 
artist conbined the art style of Spaz, Maxwell, and 
Galan to creat a almost perfect style of penciling for 
the Sonic comic. Maybe Steven needs to practice on 
drawing Sally, but since she won't be showing up in
the Sonic comic main stories for a while, he doesn't
have to worry about it right now.

	Now to the writer, Karl Bollers. Bollers have
written for Sonic many times before. But most of the 
time, the result wasn't good. I still can't get use to
Sonic saying the word "like", it's completely out of 
character. Hopefully, Karl will not repeat that mistake
again. And the story line for Sonic #61-#63 looks 
promising. And I'm looking forward to his Naugus saga.  

	Ken Penders have said that the quality of the 
Sonic comic will start to pick up starting at Sonic #62.
And it seems he's right. The quality of #62 picked up
dramaticly from #59-#61. If Karl Bollers do everything
right, the Sonic comic will reach Knuckles' quality in
no time! I mean look at it...everything's in place to
make Sonic a great comic. The art's there, the coloring's
there, the inking's there. If Karl writes it well, the
comic will fly...plot wise that is...
