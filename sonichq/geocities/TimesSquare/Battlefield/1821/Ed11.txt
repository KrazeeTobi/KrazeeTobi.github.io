  Villains (No not the Verve Pipe album! ;))---Joya Nappo


   The villains from the Sonic comics after Robotnik's 
demise were Mammoth Magul, Ixis Nagus, and Warlord Kudos.  
But those there including Uma, are now in suspended 
animation.  BUt we still have Monkey Kahn and a new one 
called, "The Iron Queen", and she's a human!  Who knows, 
maybe she's realated to Robotnik considering she is one 
of the Overlanders.  But, Mammoth Mugal, Ixis Nagus and 
Warold Kudos, one of those three would've been good 
replacment villains now that Robotnik's gone, well
for now anyway.  

  The villains in the Knuckles comics are fun, though.  
Such as Renfield the Rodent, or course we remember him 
from the Sonic Presents Chaotix Special.  And my favorite: 
Downtown Ebony Hare!   But in my opinion, the Sonic villains 
kind of gotten tasteless, but the Knuckles villains like 
those two I mentioned, are interesting.   But the best villain 
of all would've been Nack the Weasel, if only they would bring 
HIM back!  Who knows?  If they ever bring Nack back, they 
might team him up with Ebony Hare,  now that's a great 
team!  ;)  And who knows?  You might be seeing a team like 
that if you're into my fanfics, hint hint!  ;) You never
know!
