            A bunch of facts about Sonic that I know.

	The first Sonic game for The Katana, or whatever it's 
called, is rumored to come out in 1999. For now, it's called 
Katana Sonic. I'm not sure what type of game this is. I hope 
it's an RPG. The Katana is a 128 bit system (I think). The 
Katana should be a good system. It should blow N64 away. It 
should blow it away so much that it will blow N64 off the 
market! It should even blow Nintendo off the market!!! Heh 
heh hoo hee hoo!...okies.
     	
	Robotnik is rumored to come back in Sonic Comic issue #69,
or 75...I think 75 is when Sonic and Sally get married. I hope 
Robotnik comes back. They should include a new enemy too. As for
Sonic and Sally,I hope they are happy. I am happy...
     	
	Knuckles Comic will not stop at 25. That is a good thing 
for the Knuckles likers.
     	
	Sonic R is (I think) stopping it's production. There might 
be a Sonic R II for the Katana. It's just what we need, another 
racing game.:-)


That's all I know...for now...
