        An analysis of Ken Penders email---By Zifei

>The era of round-robin creators on SONIC is over as of issue #62.
>Commencing with that issue, Karl Bollars is the regular writer and 
>Steven Butler is the new regular penciler. I've seen pages of

	Good news and bad news. The good news is they won't let anymore
"bad" writers or artist jump on the wagon. The bad news is that they
let Karl Bollers be the regular writer. I'm not saying Karl is a bad
writer, but he just can't write using "Sonic" style. I also saw some of
Steven Butlers art, and I’m very impressed. This guy could be the next 
Spaz.

	Oh...so Ken Penders is still directing the plot...that's good 
news, too. At least the people at Archie are not letting Karl do the 
whole plot.

>As for the back-up stories, I'm writing, inking and coloring every one

>Maxwell doing a turn featuring Lupe and the Wolf Pack in SONIC #66

>TALES OF THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS then becomes TALES OF THE GREAT WAR for 
>at least six issues, which possibly an interruption with SONIC #75. 
>After that, we'll see.

	My question is what happened to Art Mawhinney? Shouldn't he
be penciling the main stories? Or maybe his busy with another project...
the new Sonic cartoon? Now, the TALES OF THE GREAT WAR, a very 
interesting topic. Hope they will include Queen Acorn in there.

>Over at KNUCKLES, after the upcoming CHAOTIX CAPER runs in issues #13
>through #15, issues #16 through #18 break format somewhat. #16 is a
>single issue story entitled "Reunions", which resolves some things 
>and sets up others. #17 and #18 feature the two-part "The Guardian 
>Who Failed", which, while being self-contained is the beginning of 
>an arc that culminates with issue #25. The same applies to the next

>are self-contained yet part of a greater whole, which comes to [its] 
>resolution in issue #25's 25-page epic "Childhood's End". During
>the run, we're going to answer lots of questions, raise new ones
>(naturally), and set ourselves up to switch into high gear for the 
>next 25 issues.

	"Reunions" would be really interesting. I bet it's mostly
between Knuckles and Julie-su...a hot topic. I still don't get it...
why is the Knuckles Comic getting all the good stuff? I mean, look at
it, Knuckles' got the better covers, better frontispiece, better art,
better story...I really hope the Sonic Comic change for the better
come issue #62.

>What about the SONIC SUPER SPECIALS? Issue #5's SONIC KIDS should be
>out soon, with SONIC #50: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT featured in issue #6 due 
>out in June. Tentative for September release in issue #7 is something 
>so special, so secret, that I can't even say a word about it until 
>Archie is ready to do so. The script is completed, the art is being

>ever to appear in a SONIC comic. Issue #8 is in the planning stages. 
>Originally, KNUCKLES: TWENTY YEARS LATER was scheduled to run, but

	Super Special issue #7 will be the crossover between Sonic and
characters from another comic company. Right now, all we know is that
the other characters won't be furies or animals. Knuckles: Twenty Years
Later should, IMO, be the best Super Special ever. Look for Spaz to 
pencil that special. 

>One of the specials I'm planning will feature ONLY the FEMALE characters 
>in SOLO or FEMALE TEAM-UP stories. Since we have SALLY, BUNNIE, HERSHEY, 
>LUPE, JULIE-SU and a couple of others, this promises to be one fun book.

	That's good, they need more of this to draw in female readers...
and there are a lot of female readers out there. In conclusion, as
I stated in my other editorial "Comic Improvements", the Sonic and
Knuckles comics have a very bright future. So stick with them!
