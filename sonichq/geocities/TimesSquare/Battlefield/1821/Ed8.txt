Sonic Will Raise Again!---By Joya Nappo


 It seems as though when Nintendo 64 came out, people turned their back
on Sonic and Sega fandom and got back into Mario fandom.  I call these
type of people, "Born-Again Mario/Nintendo fans"!  Catchy term, eh?  :)
And all my  internet friends thought Sonic fandom was slowly dying
because of that, some had hope that Sonic will be popular again, and
some lost all hope and gave up Sonic fandom, and maybe got into Nintendo
again.
  
  My theory is that when this new Sega system in the works comes out,
along with Sonic Underground, or maybe Robotnik's return in the comics,
which just might lead the FF's to get back together, Sonic fandom will
raise again, and blow Mario and Nintendo 64 right out of the water! :)
Don't worry Sonic fans!  Once that new system and cartoon comes, Sonic
Will Raise Again!
