Well it looks like another holiday dedicated to another care-loving 
parent, to whom we soulily asked for guidance, teachings, trainings, 
comfort, and of course life. Yes my dear friends, I am talking about 
Fathers Day. That one day we gather around the easy chair, showering 
him with gifts, treat him like a king and saying "I love you Daddy and 
thanks"

Yet sadly, we find our friends from Sonic (Archie) may not be able to 
celebrate this holiday either.

Poor dear Sonic won't be able to spend Fathers Day with his dad on 
account that he is still looking for Naugus. Oh well maybe next year.

Tails may not even remember if he even has a dad.

Antoine doesn't even know that his dad is still alive and is now on 
the side of evil.

Knuckles has know idea that his dad is still around and is looking 
over him. Perhaps someday they might celebrate Fathers Day together.

We have know idea what ever happened to Bunnie's, Rotor's, Dulcy's, 
and the other Freedom Fighter's dads were.

And it looks like that dear sweet Sally may not want to celebrate 
Fathers day with her father after their little "dissaggrement".
