<B>Background:</B> Sally is King Acorn's daughter, and the leader of the Freedom Fighters. She's determined to restore Mobotopolis to what it used to be before Robotnik took over. She cares deeply for Sonic, but Sonic is half way around the world from her. To make matters worse, her father has given her an ultimatum in accepting the throne of Mobius: She must marry Antoine, or she will lose her right to claim the throne. Furthermore, by King Acorn's orders, she's been kept out of matters regarding Geoffrey and the new strike force team.</p>

<img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/antoine2.gif"><BR>
<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Antoine D'Coolette</font></b><BR>
<b>Age:</B> 18 years<BR>
<B>Sex:</B> Male<BR>
<B>Species:</B> Coyote<BR>
<B>Abilities:</B> Eh... nothing... wait! Does cleaning count?<BR>
<B>Weakness:</B> He's a coward, but he tries.<BR>
<b>Relatives:</B> Father: General D'Coolette<BR>
<B>Background:</b> Antoine WAS a big jerk, coward, loser... he has been changing lately for the better. He's now got a girlfriend, Bunnie! (Although King Acorn's intentions may put a halt to that relationship.) He is good at fencing, cleaning, and cooking. He's now getting braver, too. Probably he'll become a royal guard under the recovered King Acorn.</P>

<img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/dulcy.gif"><BR>
<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Dulcy Dragon</font></font><BR>

<B>Weakness:</B> She can't land! LOOK OUT BELOW!!!<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Dulcy is the last of the dragon race on Mobius. She helps the Freedom Fighters with aerial missions. 
She also has an off-beat sense of humor, invoking it at the wrong times. With Robotnik gone forever (we think), Dulcy is 
now free to roam Mobius in peace.<BR>

<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Geoffrey St. John</font></font><BR>

<B>Background:</B> Geoffrey emerged as the leader of a recon group called the Rebel Underground, King Acorn's secret service. Today, he uses his skills to aid the Freedom Fighters. Geoffrey used to show affections for Sally, but that has come to an end. He doesn't enjoy Sonic's attitude, & the two are often found verbally and physically trying to show each other up. He is currently under orders from King Acorn to train a new strike force team for the safety of the kingdom.<p>

<img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/chaotix.jpg"><BR>

<B>Weakness:</B> Lack of intelligence (sometimes), jump before looking.<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Knuckles is the guardian of the Floating Island, and the Chaos Emeralds which keep it afloat. He is a loner, although Julie-su might become a relative... Knuckles is also the leader of the Chaotix team, currently made up of Julie-Su, Espio Chameleon, Vector Crocodile, and Mighty
Armadillo. He disliked Sonic and fought him everytime he got a chance, but now they're friends. He has successfully returning to the Floating Island after leading the Forgotten Tribe back to the fabled city of Albion on the mainland Mobius.<BR>

<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Espio Chameleon</font></font><BR>

<B>Weakness:</B> Not very strong.<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Espio is vital member to the Chaotix. He can often be found with the rest of the team 
in their adventures on the Floating Island. When he's alone, he likes to hang out in his invisible treehouse home
in Rainbow Valley.<BR>

<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Vector Crocodile</font></font><BR>
<b>Age:</B> 15 years<BR>
<B>Sex:</B> Male<BR>
<B>Species:</B> Crocodile<BR>
<B>Relatives:</B> Unknown<BR>
<B>Abilities:</B> Powerful swimmer.<BR>
<B>Weakness:</B> Lack of intelligence, gets too caught up in his music.<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Vector is the party-member of the Chaotix. Everywhere he goes, he is NEVER seen without his 
traditional walkman blasting his favorite tunes. Still, he's tough in battle, with a killer attitude to match.
He carries a mistrust towards Julie-Su, and still believes that she will turn on the team sooner or later.<BR>

<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Mighty Armadillo</font></font><BR>
<b>Age:</B> 15 years<BR>
<B>Sex:</B> Male<BR>
<B>Species:</B> Armadillo<BR>
<B>Relatives:</B> Unknown<BR>
<B>Abilities:</B> Incredible strength.<BR>
<B>Weakness:</B> Lack of speed, has a large temper.<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Mighty is the strong arm of the Chaotix. He is usually called upon for the heavy tasks when the Chaotix
are in trouble. He's an old friend of Sonic. He was also best friends with Charmy until he went away recently.<BR>

<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Charmy Bee</font></font><BR>
<b>Age:</B> 15 years<BR>
<B>Sex:</B> Male<BR>
<B>Species:</B> Bee<BR>
<B>Relatives:</B> Parents: King and Queen of the Bee Realm<BR>
<B>Abilities:</B> Flying, very quick.<BR>
<B>Weakness:</B> Very small (Well, most of the time anyway.)<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Charmy was a member of the Chaotix until recently, and in many people's opinion, he was the cutest.
He can shrink himself in size when he goes to fly. He has a big heart, and was often found hanging out with Mighty, his 
best friend. He was also the voice of reason when the team was in trouble. He has now returned to his home in Goldenhive 
Colony and accepted his destiny as Prince of the Bee Realm. Still, we may see him again someday.<BR>

<P><img src="/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/colord.gif"><font size=+1><B>Julie-Su Echidna</font></font><BR>
<b>Age:</B> 15 years<BR>

<B>Relatives:</B> Unknown, although Knuckles may become one soon...<BR>
<B>Abilities:</B> Proficient with guns and other weapons.<BR>
<B>Weakness:</B> Major attitude, doesn't always ask for help.<BR>
<B>Background:</B> Julie-Su is a former member of the Dark Legion. She has since sided with Knuckles, and she is the newest 
member of the Chaotix team. She has an attitude, and she insists at times that doesn't need anyone's help. Therefore, there 
are some (like Vector) who persist in questioning her loyalties to the team. At the same time, she seems to be developing affections for Knuckles, although she's not sure why.<BR>
