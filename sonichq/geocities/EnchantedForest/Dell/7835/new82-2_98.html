<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>Sonic Newsgroup Weekly Summary!</font><br></b>
From now on, each week, our new News Crew member <a href="mailto:swiftyhedgehog@geocities.com">Swifty</a> will be doing a summary of the Sonic The Hedgehog Newsgroup on Usenet. I'll shut up now and let Swifty take over...
<p>Swifty Reporting: If you all don't know who I am, I'm the new guy reporting for the Sonic Newsgroups. And here's the summary:
<p>Something interesting came up in which I found... funny. The Sonic Newsgroups does have it's people who are just looking for things. This one person, who I shall keep him/her without naming, asking if anyone knew where to find Sonic XXX pictures. First of all, Sonic and everyone else are already naked furries. And well, if you would really like to see any extra things which I really don't want to put in my mind or any of you readers...never mind.
<p>Those people who are into ROMS with the GENECYST, can now go into the HIDDEN PALACE ZONE in Sonic 2. A "simple trick" really...if you can understand all of that hooba job. Found out the trick in getting it to work, and posted it up on the Sonic News Groups this week. If you're interested in
how to do this, simply click<A HREF="alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog">here,</A> and search for a post called "GENECYST HIDDEN PALACE CODE DISCOVERED." Well, I for one, have never played the Hidden Palace zone, and for a friendly warning, I wouldn't want to go through so much work with my
Genecyst to play that zone. That's how hard this "code" is. You also need a hax-editor.
<p>So what do you think? Pretty cool, huh? Aren't we creative or what!? This is his first summary, so you can bet on your...eh...whatever you want to bet on that the summaries will get better and better!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>More Sonic Adventure Screens!</font><br></b>
More high resolution screen shots showed up on the net the past few days. Keep in ming that they are all middle quality jpg files, so there are some bluring around. But what can I say? Those pictures show more detail than any other game out there! Sega Rally 2, the best graphical game out there right now can't even compare to Sonic Adventure. Latest estimates states that Sonic Adventure is running about 1.3-2.0 million pps.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>Sonic Adventure Brochure!</font><br></b>
At last weekend's Sonic Adventure conference, Sega of Japan was selling a nice looking brochure that contained all the screenshots of Sonic Adventure that have been shown on the web so far (and more). In it, you could find game designs, level designs, character profiles, and more. It's already a very hot collector's item! But since it's only on sale on Japan, probably not many people will get one. But thanks to <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/">Game Informer</a>, we now can view the brochure online! Click <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/pviews/aug98/sonic/sonic.html">here</a> to view it! Note, all words on the brochure are in Japanese, but the pictures are worth it.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>Ken On The Chosen One (Tails).</font><br></b>
Remember that Ken said something about Kent Tylor working on a special project that's about a year off? Could this be it?
<p><i>The 3-issue story KNUCKLES: THE CHOSEN ONE will begin either in issue #32 or #35.  Kent Taylor and I have begun discussions on what we want to do with this (after all, he started it), and I think we'll answer a lot of questions
while leaving the door open for more.  And yes, Merlin Prower will be a part of the storyline, along with Athair and the Ancient Walkers.</i>
<p>This one could be very interesting, probably climaxing in a super special, #12 to be exact.  
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>Antoine's Father...</font><br></b>
Maric reporting: I received a message from one of my friends in MSC and he said that he has received a reply from Ken Penders that Antoine's father might make a comeback. I'm not sure when, but I'll keep up updated when I do. Maybe this one the when Antoine finds out about his father.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>Tobor...</font><br></b>
Lien-Na reporting: you know how Moritori Rex is the "Tobor" in Haven? He's able to live long like a Guardian because when he was in that zone where the ruins collapsed, it made them age slower. And their eyes got really damaged so Tobor got his replaced and the other "Tobor" has that visor thing. Also, Ken got the name Tobor from a Japanese Anime.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-28-98</font> <font size=+1>Knuckles #18 Release Date!</font><br></b>
Archie Comic's Knuckles #18 will be released in comic stores on September 2, 1998 across America.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-23-98</font> <font size=+1>Return Of The Hedgehog Part 2.</font><br></b>
Now that we finally saw the actual Sonic Adventure, we can have a look at what this game will do. First off, this game is the best looking graphical game to date, NO other game can compare. Even games from the arcades have trouble. And from the looks of things, the Sonic Team did a great job in keeping Sonic's super speed. They solved the exploring part by letting other slower characters do it. This game might just be revolutionary. The characters will be able to interact and make enemies and friends with other minor characters in the game called Choas. Then at times, your new *friends* will help you out. Now, think about this, this is only a FIRST generation game for the Dreamcast, and it's already running at 60fps and 640*480 resolution with about 1.5+million polygons per second. Think of the Sonic sequels behind it and a few years down the line! After Sonic Team make NiGHTS, they might just turn back and make a Sonic Adventure 2. If they don't do it, it's a sure bet that Traveler's Tale will make a Sonic game (Sonic R 2?). Since I AM a Sega fan, this is my point of view: with Sonic Adventure's showing Sega IS back. Sonic should be the BIG game of the next year, beating out other games like Zelda and Sega's own powerful line ups. With the announcement of Sonic Adventure, everyone's favorite hedgehog is officially back on the game scene! Long live the hedgehog! 
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: I Found Tails!</font><br></b>
OK, I finally got the Tails picture for the Sonic Adventure title screen (I suppose). Click <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_08/22_character/screenshot2.jpg">here</a> to view it!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Game Control.</font><br></b>
The game will only use the analog pad and two buttons but the actions will be varied between the characters. That's good, it follows the tradition of Sonic games been easy to learn.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Won't Be A Launch Game?</font><br></b>
As we said before, Sonic Adventure is only 60% complete right now. Sonic Team will only have about 3 month left to finish the game (which is nearly not possible even for the 60 member strong Sonic Team). So the game might be delayed for Japan's launch. but that doesn't metter for the people over here in America or over there in Eroupe (well, unless you're importing). 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: More On The New Sonic Adventure Characters!</font><br></b>
There are two new main characters in the game, here's they're story:
<p><b>Big The Cat</b>: He’s big. He’s a cat. He loves fishing and carries a fishing rod wherever he goes. Living with his dear friend 'Frog’ near the ruins, one day Frog swallowed a Chaos emerald and disappeared. Big Cat picked up his familiar rod and lure and embarked on the adventure. He says, "I’m big. When I was sleeping, my friend Frog disappeared. Where did he go? Frog! Frog!"
<p><b>E-102 'Ganma’</b>: Made by Dr. Eggman, E-102 is a highly accurate shooting robot. E-102 is the second of the E-100 series machines and is fiercely obedient to Dr Eggman. He says, "I’m E-102, codenamed 'Ganma’. I am a robot created by my master Dr. Eggman. I will always follow Dr. Eggman’s orders. The blue hedgehog is my sworn enemy, at least I think he is." But he turned out to be on the good guys' side.  
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: The Best Looking Sonic Adventure Screen Yet!</font><br></b>
As more and more Sonic Adventure screen shots surface on the web, this one stands out above the rest. Maybe it's because of the moment the picture's taken. But what ever the case, the graphic is the picture is CG quality (in other words, Toy Story+)! It's really hard to imagine that we're actually getting this. And keep in mind that the game is only 60% complete. If the graphics look this good at only 60%...then at 100%...oh I'm in Heaven! Click <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_08/21_sonone/screenshot1.jpg">here</a> to view the picture.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure - How Long?!</font><br></b>
Now that we have seen the game and learned the game play, another question comes to mind: "How long's the game?!" Right now some are saying 7-10 levels, others are saying 36 acts in 18 zones. I know it's really confusing, so I'll sum it up. The game will have 10+ major levels, with at least 2 acts in each. Then there's the bonus levels (5+). And the characters will play differently in each level. In other words, this game will be a LONG one, with a lot of replay value. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure To Be At TGS 98!</font><br></b>
Sonic Adventure will show up at Tokyo Game Show 98 in playable version this coming October. If you can get there, be there! If you can't, we'll keep you in check.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Boss Screens!</font><br></b>
Here's a few picture about the bosses in Sonic Adventures, and no, they're not Dr. Eggman. But he's got something to do with them.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: More On Sonic Adventure's Levels!</font><br></b>
Here's more info about some of them that were shown at the show. But this is just a small part of the whole game. Source: Game-Online.
<p><b>Ice Cap Zone</b> - A good old snow level set on mountains with avalanches and Sonic doing snowboarding. The snow and ice in the background are very detailed. 
<p><b>Red Mountain</b> - A desert stage also involving a mine section. Perfect for Knuckles. A lot of sharp spikes in this level, and if you're a person who's afraid of heights, this level's not for you. Now unlike the previous games, if you fall off a bridge of the edge, you'll fall a long way...
<p><b>Lost World</b> - A mysterious jungle, set below towering mountain. A chance for the Dreamcast to show off its amazing vistas. And by the look of it, this is probably the most detailed zone.
<p><b>Inca</b> - The level inspired by Sonic Team's expedition to South America. An architectural marvel, with huge trap-littered temples to explore.
<p><b>Speed Highway</b> - Classic Sonic territory - an incredible neon city for Sonic to rip through, defying gravity, running down the sides of skyscrapers dodging civic scenery - brilliant fountains - traffic. The buildings in this level look just incredible! I've never seen such details in any other game!
<p><b>Flying Section</b> - This is not the official title, but describes one of the key sub-levels, where Sonic and Tails return to their bi-plane from Sonic 2 and engage in some Panzer Dragoon-style shoot 'em up action - facing 'Chaos' (that water dragon) in the air.
<p>That's all for now, we'll bring you more when more information becomes available. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Character Skills.</font><br></b>
With the leap into 3D for Sonic, many new moves were added to the characters. From what I know, Sonic will be able to run down a building, do a newly designed (and better looking) spin attack, and run very fast; Knuckles has the greatest variety of moves, he could glide, climb, punch, and burrow (oh yes); Tails can fly and pilot the bio-plane; Amy can do that pico-pico hammer trick she did in Sonic The Fighters; E-102 can shoot; and Big the Cat can use the fishing rod his carring as a weapon.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Level Names.</font><br></b>
A few names were given, such as Ice Cap (this is a remake of Sonic 3's Ice Cap), Red Mountain, Lost World, and Speed Highway. Also, there's a lava zone, an Aztec temple zone, and an air zone. We'll bring you more info on this soon.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Takes Place On Earth!</font><br></b>
I already mentioned this, but not very clearly. According to the Sonic Adventure Conference, the game will take place on Earth (well, that's the strongest arguement for those "Mobius is Earth" people, right?). Also in the game, you'll be able to fly the bio-plane (wohoo!). 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: More Sonic Adventure Screens!</font><br></b>
They just keep on looking better and better. This game will indeed be the base for future games! As far as I can tell, the graphics in the game are way better than Model 3 step 2 arcade graphics. Add on the light effects and retouches done by the Dreamcast hardware...you get the PERFECT looking game! Sonic has officially returned to kick some hmm...someone's behind...

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: More On Sonic Adventure's VMS!</font><br></b>
Now that we know Sonic Adventure will take advantage of the VMS (a PDA for Dreamcast), we wonder what it will do. Here's two screens from the VMS, <a href="http://gamenet.simplenet.com/dreamcast/screens/sonicvms1.jpg">one</a> and <a href="http://gamenet.simplenet.com/dreamcast/screens/sonicvms2.jpg">two</a>. From the look of it, it might be used to make friends with others in the game.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Screens!</font><br></b>
I'll just say they're unbelievable! You must see them for yourself to believe! Click <a href="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/news/4254.html">here</a> to see 12 of them at Next-Generation.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Facts!</font><br></b>
I'll just run down the facts:
1) Mr. Naka will try something in the game to keep you playing it. We don't know what yet.<br>
2) The whole game runs at 60 frames per second, in high-resolution at 640x480! This game is perfect!<br>
3) NiGHTS characters cameo in the game and Sonic Adventure DOES support the VMS!
4) There are six bonus mini-games, kind of like the special stages in the Sonic games. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure's Worlds Are HUGE!</font><br></b>
Here's What Yuji Naka said about it:
<p><i>I’ve put huge efforts into creating a big map. Of course, I have to focus on the details of the 3D world, but I have to create a vast huge scale map as well. This is the most difficult aspect of Sonic Adventure. If it were Mario or a slower character, I wouldn’t have to create maps quite as large as this. I created the huge world first for Sonic, but then thought, why not utilise these maps for other characters? Maybe I could add some variety to the game - not just running quickly through this huge world. That’s one of the key concepts in the game.</i>
<p>And he also said that this is the biggest and fastest action game ever made! Must be, because last I heard, Sonic Team trippled in size from 20 to 60 members!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Gameplay!</font><br></b>
I'll just say that if you played Mario 64, this game will be 20 times more detailed and 20 times as fast. Although the core of the game is based on action, RPG elements are included too, with Sonic able to recruit new allies and gain information by talking to the people around the new Sonic worlds. The game would use the camera to guide you through the levels. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Plot!</font><br></b>
Dr Robotnik is back once again. This time, he’s been busy in South America, unearthing a deadly, primal force known simply as Chaos. This elemental force is responsible for drowning an entire city(told ya the video's from the game!), wreaking terrible destruction in its wake. You might have seen an Abyss-style lizard/water hybrid creature in some of the leaked Sonic Adventure materials. That’s Chaos. Robotnik has been feeding him with crystals to boost his power, and now it’s time for Sonic to step into the fray to defeat Chaos, his minions and of course, Dr Robotnik himself. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic to Talk!</font><br></b>
Sonic and other characters will talk in the Sonic Adventure! Yuji Naka said that this will be the first time you'll see Sonic talking to a human!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-22-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Characters...</font><br></b>
OK, finally got around the excitement and updated this page. There will be six playable characters in the game(!). They are Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Amy, Big, and the robot E-102. Each character will have six acts to complete. All of them will have special moves we haven't seen before. Each character has six Acts to complete and all of them are inter-related! This, I think, is the only RPG element in it.
