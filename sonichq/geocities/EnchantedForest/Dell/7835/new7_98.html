<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>A Look Ahead.</font><br></b>
Since it's a really slow news week, I thought of showing you what's coming up. Usually news are hard to find during the summer month. But for this year, they'll start to pick up as we enter August. first we start with the San Diego Comic-Con in mid-August; then there's August 22, Sonic Adventure; after that, Sonic Underground will be showing up; then the SSS#7; then the Tokyo Game Show in October; which in turn is followed by the Dreamcast release in November and Sonic the Fighters release over here for Saturn.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Issue #64 Release Date!</font><br></b>
Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog issue #64 will be released in comic stores on August 19th across America.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>Tokyo Game Show 98!</font><br></b>
Tokyo Game Show '98: Fall will be held on October 9th through 11th and will take place in Makuhari Messe, in Chiba. As you know, Sega is planning to over run that show with Dreamcast and will have playable games at the show. Maybe we'll get lucky enough to see Sonic running there.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>New All Star Game.</font><br></b>
Sega of Japan is currently making an Sega all star game for the Dreamcast. This game will include all the major character in Sega. This could mean that Sonic is in it as well. This game should be out in 1999. No word on the name yet, but we'll keep you informed.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>Monkey Will Be Back!</font><br></b>
NoeleT2 reporting: For those of you who are wondering when Monkey Khan will make another appearance since issue #60, well wonder no further. Monkey Khan's next appearance is in STH #70.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Adventure Tadbit.</font><br></b>
Yuji Naka said in an interview with Game Plus that Sonic Adventure will be running on an whole new 3D engine. the game graphic were designed with the use of expensive 3D modelling equipment costing tens of million yens.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-31-98</font>  <font size=+1>New Fan Comic!</font><br></b>
New Sonic fan comics just keep on poping up. This time the new comic is called Sonic Ideal, it is drawn by <a href="mailto:luna@csrlink.net">Ruby Echidna</a>. The comic will be based on the Sega Sonic storyline. Although Sally will still be in it, only in another out look. Click <a href="http://sirkain.erols.com/~ruby/segasonic/">here</a> for more info.  
<HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-28-98</font>  <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure To Be Out This Year!</font><br></b>
Yes, you read it right. It seems that now Sonic Adventure will be around just after the launch of Sega Dreamcast in Japan this December 20th according to this quote from National Console Support:
<p><i>Two Dreamcast games have been confirmed for simultaneous release with the console on November 20. The first is Seventh Cross, an RPG from NEC and the second is Pen Pen Dry Ice Run. The latter is a racing game from General Entertainment. Four other releases are expected in November-December: Table of D2, <b>Sonic Adventure</b>, Godzilla, and War Turbo.</i>
<p>Note that Sonic Adventure will also be a launch title over here in the States and in Europe in the fall of 1999. And as you know, some elements in the game might change during translation.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-25-98</font>  <font size=+1>SatAM Cartoons...</font><br></b>
Joya reporting: Someone on the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog newsgroup announced that you could order Sonic The Hedgehog cartoon videos at this <a href="http://www.videoflicks.com">address</a>. You'll have to search for <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>. There are only a few SatAMs on sale, and they cost between $8-$14. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-25-98</font>  <font size=+1>More on Chaos Adventures.</font><br></b>
Well, forget what I reported yesterday! The editor decided to come back...so there will be a Chaos Adventures, the question is when will the first issue come out.
<HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-24-98</font>  <font size=+1>Breaking News: Naka Speaks to Saturn Fan!</font><br></b>
Well, from what Naka's saying, Sonic Adventure will be perfect! Here's the quote:
<p><i> I didnt really think the level of graphics was much different from the Saturn, at first, but when I actually got to see it, I realized it was on a whole different level, with the real-time graphics on display. Up until now, that kind of capability could only be produced with a mega-expensive machine. I think Sonic will form the base for plenty of future games. Usually when you make games, you can always see room for improvement, but with Sonic Adventure, this time I truly thought it was perfect when I showed it to other staff members, they were really wowed by it and we can show this on the day of the launch event.</i>
<p>Mr. Naka also called it an action game with a story. This came from <a href="http://www.next-generation.com">Next-Generation</a>. Also Yuji Naka will be appearing at a Famitsu sponsored event called Game Circus on July 25-26, might get more Sonic Adventure news out of him there.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-24-98</font>  <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic to Change!</font><br></b>
This is from <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/">Game Spot</a>:
<p><i>In an interview with Sega Saturn Magazine, Sega's Yuji Naka talked a little bit about the upcoming Dreamcast Sonic game, Sonic Adventure. According to Naka, Sonic Adventure was initially called Sonic RPG. Even though the game's main focus is action, there will obviously be more to it than just that.
<p>As you've probably seen, currently there is only one piece of artwork available for Sonic Adventure. It only shows Sonic's mysteriously green eye and a big grin. According to Naka, Sonic's design will change a bit this time. We'll see the new Sonic when Sonic Adventure is officially unveiled on August 22.</i>
<p>So, expect this game to be a mix between RPG and Adventure. I hope they don't change Sonic that much...wouldn't be Sonic anymore. Now we'll go check with Penders and see if Sonic will change design in the comics, too. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-24-98</font>  <font size=+1>San Diego Comic-Con</font><br></b>
This comic-con takes place on August 13-16, at the San Diego Convention Center. The show opens at about 10 AM. It costs $20 to get in, $10 if you're a junior (ages 7-16). For Sunday, it's half price. Expect Ken Penders, Scott Shaw!, and Jim Amash to be there. Rich Koslowski and Harvey Mercadoocasio might be there. So if you can go there, GO! But if you can't like moi (who lives in the middle of nowhere), we'll have an exclusive report about at the show thanks to <a href="mailto:lien_na@hotmail.com">Lien-na</a>.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-24-98</font>  <font size=+1>Nicole and Robotnik...</font><br></b>
Here's something interesting. Ken Penders said that Sonic Super Special #9, Knuckles: Twenty Years Later would make the future in Sonic In Your Face the true future. So if that's true, then Nicole "would be destoryed in the decisive battle against Robotnik" as stated in SIYF. Here we run into a problem, Ken said in the HQ interview that Robotnik doesn't exist anymore. But Nicole still does. So what's the deal? We'll try to do some digging on this. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-24-98</font>  <font size=+1>No Choas Adventure!</font><br></b>
Seems like the editor for this fan comic has quit...so there will not be a Chaos Adventures. But since I (Zifei) did draw about three covers for that comic, you can view the covers in my fan art page on Sonic HQ's Fan Art Section.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-24-98</font>  <font size=+1>HQ Exclusive: Knuckles 1997 Direct Sales Chart.</font><br></b>
I know it's half way through 1998, but enough people wanted this, so I made it. This is for Knuckles direct sales, meaning preordered sales in comic stores. And note that last year, Knuckles did not go month after month, instead the comic skipped a month every three issues until December. So because of that, the sale number was at 0. OK, click <a href="News_Knucklessales97.gif">here</a> to view the chart!
<HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-23-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic's New Moves...</font><br></b>
I got a stock pile of news for tomorrow (7-24), so I thought, hey, why not throw out some news today!
<p>Anyway, these are rumors. As Sonic cross into true 3D platform in Sonic Adventure, he will have many new moves (that's confirmed). But which ones? Rumors say that Sonic will have all his moves from the canceled Sonic X-treme. In that case, it means Sonic will be able to run up walls and onto ceilings; do the spinslash, which would let Sonic do a mid air 360 degrees attack with his spikes jutting assertively outwards; and throw rings and emeralds. But since Sonic X-treme wasn't worked on by the Sonic Team, you can be sure that there will be a lot of other moves add on to the list.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-23-98</font>  <font size=+1>Knuckles Comic News!</font><br></b>
NoeleT2 reporting: Most of you fans pretty much know that Manny Galan is the permanent Knuckles artist. I asked Ken Penders about this and it's <b>true</b>, but this is what he said to me:
<p><i>As far as I'm concerned, Manny is the permanent Knuckles artist. However he will be taking a break, and Jim Valentino,who is pencilling Sonic Super Special #7, will be filling on Knuckles #22 through #24, with Manny returning for #25.</i>
<p>I bet most Knuckles fans are relieved that Manny will take a break. I know I am! And when a talented artist like Galan get two month to work on an issue, you can bet that the art in Knuckles #25 will be good! Also, as Ken stated in a letter to the Sonic Mailing list a long time ago (go search the news archives...). Knuckles #22-24 will focus on Julie-su.
<HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-21-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Adventure In America...</font><br></b>
Sources close to Sega have said that Sega has plans to begin marketing Sonic Adventure shortly after E3 (late May) of 1999, with a playable version of the game likely to highlight next year's expo. We keep you informed of this development.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-21-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Save the Screens!</font><br></b>
Thanks to <a href="mailto:slvrfx@usa.net">Raymond C. "SilverFox" Dukes</a>, now there's a really cool Sonic Screen Saver in town! And the best part...it's free! Click <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/2667/sss30.html">here</a> for download and more information. Mr. Dukes told me that:
<p><i>There will probably be one more update, to 4.0 and then that's it for the Sonic Screen Saver, however, if there are enough requests, I may do an ARCHIE Sonic Screen Saver.</i>
<p>Cool, huh? What are you waiting for?! Go get it!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-21-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic RPG Tadbits</font><br></b>
OK, before you start screaming: "Oh my God! So there is a Sonic RPG!" Read the whole article first.
<p>Jeff1089 reporting: Here's a Sonic RPG rumor I found from <a href="http://knothole.simplenet.com/">Virtual Knothole</a>! Here it is:
<p><i>As far as titles are concerned, Sega is working on several new, high-profile games, including Virtua Fighter 3.5 (said to be a version of Virtua Fighter 3: Team Battle), Super GT+, and a brand new Sonic Role Playing Game.  VF 3.5 and Super GT+ are thought to be launch titles (late 1998) and Sonic RPG will arrive sometime in 1999.<br>
--EGM, Electronic Gaming Monthly -- February, 1998 Issue 102</i>
<p>Don't get your hopes high yet. EGM isn't exactly the most accurate source, infact, their track record is really bad at reporting facts. This issue's in February, way before the Dreamcast announcement, at the time, Sega wasn't saying a thing about their next machine. So how could EGM have known? They guessed! When reliable resources such as the Sega Saturn Mag., Next-Generation Mag., and Game Weekly start reporting a Sonic RPG, then you could start believing.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-20-98</font>  <font size=+1>HQ Exclusive: Interview with Ben Acorn!</font><br></b>
We finally got Ben on the line and did the interview. For those of you who doesn't know Ben is, he's the midi maker who made Sonic Boom. We learned a lot of interesting stuff from Ben, such as how to make a midi file, and what's his latest work. Ben also gave us a view at the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/Music.gif">program</a> he uses to make midis.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-18-98</font>  <font size=+1>Return of the Hedgehog...Part 1</font><br></b>
We're going to do a series that covers the return of our favorite hedgehog. We're doing part 1 now at the announcement of Sonic Adventure for Sega Dreamcast.
<p>How did the Sega Saturn fail? One reason was poor marketing, but another major reason, as many people point out, was that there was no Sonic. Yeah sure, Sonic R and 3D Blast were fun. But they can't be counted as major Sonic games such as Sonic 1, 2, 3, and S&K. Sega has learned their lesson, they announced Sonic 3D way before any other Dreamcast game at E3 in 1997. Now they finally announced the name...and to make sure everyone get the message, Sega of Japan already started to advertise for the game. Check out those Sonic <a href="http://www.katana-edge.com/headlines/news-071798-train_sonic.gif">teasers</a> on a Japanese subway. To make things more exciting, numerous reports and rumors stated that the game looks "totally unbelievable!" And other reports say that "...Sonic will of course have some new moves...he is now harder and leaner then ever before!" With the Sonic Team finally back on the helm after 4 long years, expect this game to rock! Also another note: Japanese game developers usually take one year to develope a game, the Sonic Team (a great programming team) will have 2+ years. So rumor of a LARGE game could well be true. Part 2 coming on August 23.
<HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-17-98</font>  <font size=+1>More Sonic Adventure Info!</font><br></b>
Reports hint that the original concepts behind Sonic Adventure have been in the works conceptually since before NiGHTS itself began development. And that development started right after NiGHTS was finished. This means that the Sonic Team had at least one and a half year to work on this title. Other reports say that this game will be BIG, as in a 1000 level game. Speculation at this point persist that Sonic Adventure will be a launch title in Japan as well as in the United States. We'll find out more come August 22.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-17-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Underground Information!</font><br></b>
Here's a post on Sonic Zone Newsletter:
<p><i>Bernie Stolar, Sega of America's President and CEO, stated in an article in number 109 of Electronic Gaming Monthly that "there's also a Sonic TV series that starts in September."</i>
<p>Unless there's another Sonic cartoon in the makings besides Sonic Underground. I'll take Mr. Stolar's words that Sonic Underground will air in September.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-17-98</font>  <font size=+1>Virtual Sonic Music CD</font><br></b>
Sonic12321 Reporting: The Virtual Sonic Music CD is avaliable at <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/redirect/leaf=">CDnow :Discography</a>. But you'll need to search for Sega first.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-17-98</font>  <font size=+1>Another Sally's Mini-series?</font><br></b>
Many people missed the original Sally mini-series because of bad distribution by Archie. But, here's a post on Ken Penders' site:
<p><i>Knowing what we know now, could we try it again with our Sally? It's hard to say, but if enough readers make their opinions known, and show their support, anything's possible.</i>
<p>So if you really want to see another Sally mini-series, write to Archie and ask for it.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-16-98</font>  <font size=+1>Info on Sonic Adventure Conference!</font><br></b>
The Sonic Adventure game reveiling conference will be on August 22, 1998. It will be held at the Tokyo International Forum Hall. The conference is free to the public and will be held in two shows, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. 5-10,000 people are expected to attend. Mr. Naka predict it to be standing room only. Right now Sega is not saying much about this game except that:
<p><i>This will be a game that will set a new futuristic standard for gaming.</i>
<p>But as you know, there's always someone who will leak some information:
<p><i>A source who has seen unofficial images (meaning, the source is legit, but not even said source knows if what he saw was real)commented that, "Sonic Adventure will make you poop your pants, any doubts one may have had about Dreamcast will be erased". The same source also confirmed this little tidbit of Sonic Adventure information; Knuckles will most definitely appear in the game in some way, shape or form. (source: Sega Net)</i>
<p>That's it for now! Oh, BTW, sources say that the demonstration conference will be broadcasted in live streaming video on the internet. We'll keep you informed of this.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic is BACK!!!</font><br></b>
In the all new Sega Dreamcast game <b>-Sonic Adventure-</b>! Here's a quote from <a href="http://www.katana-edge.com">Katana-Edge</a>:
<p><i>Sonic Team announced its intentions for the next Sonic game today on Sega Of Japans website. On August 22 1998 the team and Sonic will be unveiled to the eager world. Yuji Naka, who has always been an important part of Sonic Team, had some exciting words about the upcoming conference. He believes that Sonic Adventure will be the standard of future gaming and we have little argument with him. The entire idea began as Sonic Team's follow up to Nights and was originally planned for Saturn. However with the slump of Saturn and immense power of the Dreamcast it was an easy decision. Sonic Adventure certainly sounds interesting and more information will be released at its official unveiling on August 22, 1998.</i>
<p>And we'll bring you the latest on August 22! While you're here, you could view a few pictures of Sonic Adventure, click <a href="http://www.katana-edge.com/headlines/news-071598-sonic1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://www.katana-edge.com/headlines/news-071598-sonic2.gif">here</a>!

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-13-98</font>  <font size=+1>Breaking News: Tails Out?!</font><br></b>
guest@Lehigh.EDU reporting: Here's a story from <a href="http://www.segadreamcast.net/">Sega X</a> about a possible replacement for Tails:
<p><i>Sonic is as popular as ever, but Tails better start watching his back (...or is it his tail?). We have found out from industry sources that Sega may have plans to unveil a brand new fan-friendly character to their video games lineup -- sort of an identifyable character to go along with the Dreamcast. Sega is creating this brand new character to garner the attraction of the casual gamer in Japan -- especially young girls. This brand new Sonic sidekick will have a cutesy look, in vivid and radiant colors. The character-related games will be action, puzzle type, and in unique Q&A type genres. Sega plans to use this new character in off-beat games, hoping to follow in the footstep of Sony's popular Parappa-the-Rapper title. Sega wasn't kidding when they said that they were working on a lot of brand new games and characters for their upcoming console.</i>
<p>Well, this character sounds like a female to me. Note that nowhere in here does it say she/he/it will be in the Sonic 3D platform game coming up for Sega Dreamcast at all. And I tell you that Tails will not be gone. He's a bit too popular for Sega to loose. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-13-98</font>  <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic the Fighters...</font><br></b>
Will come to the States for Sega Saturn. Sega of America have decided to release seven more games this year. And one of them is Sonic the Fighters (called Sonic Champions over here). The release date is described as holiday season. Sonic the Fighters is made by AM2 on the Model 2 arcade board and will be a direct port for the Saturn. One more Sonic for Saturn!

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-9-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Writers Information!</font><br></b>
Our own, WB, asked a question about what will happen to the other Sonic writers after Sonic #62, here's Ken Penders' reply:
<p><i>Mike Gallagher has a couple of stories slated for publication in SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #8.  After that, it's hard to say when or if Mike will be back as he's moved on to other projects at other publishers.  He was not fired, nor was Kent
Taylor.  Kent is working on a special Sonic project that won't be ready for at least a year if not longer.  (And it is something all Sonic fans are going to want in their collections.)  As for Frank Strom, he was only intended to do a couple of stories and no more than that.  He may yet do another Monkey Khan tale, but considering what's in store in Sonic, I'm not sure when it could be printed.
<p>As for Sam Maxwell, he just completed a 3-part Lupe back-up story which I'm now inking and slated for SONIC #67 through #69. We haven't let go of Sam yet.</i>
<p>Well, that was all. But about this special project headed by Kent Taylor, if it's one year away (12 month), it's not a special. So it could be a mini-series or a special-special...we'll keep you posted on this.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-9-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic the Fighters Info!</font><br></b>

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-3-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Super Special #11 Info!</font><br></b>
Ken Penders has reveiled information about Sonnic Super Special #11. Here's what he said:
<i><p>On another note, as it stands now, SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #11 will feature THE FEMALE FURRIES OF MOBIUS.  That's right.  Sally, Julie-Su, Bunnie, Hershey, Amy Rose and whatever female characters I think of will star  in this special issue of solo stories.  Besides writing it, I'll probably draw most of it, but I'm looking to confirm Spaz as penciller for the Julie-Su story. Details are sketchy as I'm currently developing storylines, but I'll post more when details are available.</i>
<p>For those of you who's not keeping track of what super specials' coming up, I'll catch you up: SSS6: The Director's Cut - it's already out, so go get it; SSS7: Sonic/Image crossover; SSS8: not decided yet; SSS9: Knuckle's Twenty Years Later; SSS10: Second part of Sonic #75; and SSS11: The female solos. For more information, go to our comic info page.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-3-98</font>  <font size=+1>Kath Sousie Have Another Role!</font><br></b>
I can't believe I didn't see this one. Kath Soucie, the voice of Sally in the SatAM cartoon, has yet another role. She plays the voice of David Carter's mother in Invasion America. The last episode of Invasion America will be aired on WB Network on July 7, 1998.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">7-3-98</font>  <font size=+1>Fan Reaction to SSS6: The Director's Cut.</font><br></b>
I could sum it up with one word...great! I have never seen anything like it in my 3 years career of being a Sonic comic fan. Fans just loved this special, especially the kiss (see below). The only negative words spoken on this special was that: "The kiss wasn't as strong as the Doomsday episode!"
