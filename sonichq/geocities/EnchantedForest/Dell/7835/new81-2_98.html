<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-19-98</font> <font size=+1>They Are Real!</font><br></b>
The Sonic Adventure screen shots we showed you yesterday are real! But very early versions of the game. Sega has requested that all sites take them down until (in other words, if the links break down there, it's not our fault), 8-22-98, this Friday. Expect the final showing this weekend to be way better than these screens! Also, remember the Sonic Adventure commercial we reported a while ago? Some of it are from the actual game! Cool, huh? The commercial stood for Sonic coming and creating all the chaos in the streets.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-19-98</font> <font size=+1>Manny Galan...</font><br></b>
Lien-Na reporting: He is a really fast artist, Knuckles is ahead 5 issues. It would have been 7 but he said Ken Penders had trouble keeping up with him! Aside from 23 pages of Knuckles a month he does the occasional Sonic back-up, 10-14 pages of Scooby Doo every so often, advertisements every so often, and now works a full time job with Nickelodeon. After #25 he'll only be doing back-up stories for a while because he needs to do work that is going to pay him more and allow more free time. But he says not to worry though because he will be working on what he hopes to be his finest work ever, 2 issues of Knuckles that he wrote for fun, which should be scheduled some time in the 30th issues.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-19-98</font> <font size=+1>The Man On the Cover...</font><br></b>
Asudem reporting: The guy on the bottom of the Sonic Super Special #7 cover is named Dr. Eandroid. He's one of the Lost Ones (Ken Pender's creation, another comic book that's due out a few month from now, go to his <a href="http://www.kenpenders.com">page</a> for more info). Dr. Eandroid is after the Master Emerald...his special ability (all Lost Ones have a special ability) is to become something. What I mean is that he can build himself. He can transport his mind into other objects. He CAN'T transport his mind into living creatures. Once his mind is transported into something inanimate, he controls whatever his mind went into. So, that means he can build himself! All he has to do is get a non-living body and use it to make a robot for himself! Once he makes a robot body for himself, he can transport his mind into it and control it.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-18-98</font> <font size=+1>Sonic Underground pushed back to Next Season!?</font><br></b>
<i>At a fur party that night, I met someone from
DIC who is working on Sonic Underground.  This is not a rumor.  The first episode is in the can, and the rest are in animation in China.  Sonic and Robotnik are the only two characters returning, no Tail, Sally, Bunnie and the others. It is set for release into Syndication March of 99.  What's really interesting is it's computer inked.  The cels are hand drawn then scanned into a
computerand colored.</i>
<p>This was a post from Silverfox from the San Diego Comic Con on the Sonic the Hedgehog mailing list. If what he says is true then this means that if the first episode is in the can then it's being redone. We still don't have that much new information and as far as we know production has been moved up one year. This is possibly for the better (imagine a rehash of the Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgheog.....shudder). We still have none of the previous characters but check here later for more info as we get it. Stay tuned and look for your fall previews on the TV to see if this is truth......
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-18-98</font> <font size=+1>The Saturday Morning Toon May Be Back On The Air!</font><br></b>
On the new "Toon Disney" channel commercials for Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog have begun. It could be possible that the show may be syndicated in reruns along with its predecessor. When buying toons, most companies must buy the entire syndication package so cross your fingers and stay tuned for more info. Keep in mind this is a rumor.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-18-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Sonic Adventure Screens?!</font><br></b>
A few pictures have  originate from a French site with the emblazoned Joypad logo on them. While it is not confirmed yet if those pictures are from the actual Sonic Adventure game.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-16-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Names...</font><br></b>
Jet reporting: Sally's mother, Queen Acorn, is named Alicia. And St. John's father is named Ian St. John. And Lien-na will be the name for Kragok's sister.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-16-98</font> <font size=+1>Breaking News: Knuckles' Daughter!</font><br></b>
Asudem and Jet reporting: Knuckles' daughter in Sonic Super Special #9: Knuckles Twenty Years Later will be named Lara-Su! This makes perfect sense. Knuckles' mother's name + his wife's.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-16-98</font> <font size=+1>More on Sonic Super Special #8!</font><br></b>
Jet reporting: (Her talk with Editor Justin at San Diego) He said, "it takes place in an alternate reality with, get this, Sally Moon and Chibi Rose!" Yup! Straight from the editor himself! Sally's gonna have long red pigtails and Amy Rose is gonna have puffy pink pigtails! Hmm, no wonder Archie kept this issue such a secret!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-16-98</font> <font size=+1>HQ Exclusive: San Diego Comic-Con Report Part 2!</font><br></b>
Again, Lien's bringing us another report from San Diego Comic Con International 98. This time, we learn what Sonic Super Special #8 is about and get to meet up with almost all the Sonic artists and inkers and gets to hear their side of the story. More reports should be coming in from other people that's there such as Ergon (our midi editor) and Jet (a friend). Well, anyway, read on: <a href="News_SanDiego982.txt">San Diego Report 2</a>!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-16-98</font> <font size=+1>Why Only Far Off Comic News?</font><br></b>
A few people have asked me that why we only report far off comic news and not news about comics that's right around the corner. Well, the truth is that once a comic gets within 3-4 month of being released. Our comic preview page in the Comic Info section picks it right up. So there's no need for us to report it here.
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-14-98</font> <font size=+1>HQ Exclusive: San Diego Comic-Con Report!</font><br></b>
Well, thanks again to <a href="mailto:lien_na@hotmail.com">Lien-Na</a> for giving us this report from San Diego Comic Con International. A lot of interesting stuff, such as Robo Robotnik, Manny getting married and stop penciling the main Knuckles stories, Spaz being shy...and a lot more. Lien will give us another report on Saturday along with a few others. Well, read on: <a href="News_SanDiego98.txt">San Diego Report</a>.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-14-98</font> <font size=+1>Espio's Future...</font><br></b>
According to Ken Penders, Espio will appear in a backup solo story in Knuckles issue #29. Source: <a href="https://web.archive.org/19980814000000/http://members.tripod.com/~MaraRe/index.html">Mara-Re's page</a>.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-14-98</font> <font size=+1>Sonic R PC Release Date!</font><br></b>
JERPROWER Reporting: The Sonic R PC release date is scheduled as 9/16/98. But if you could get the Saturn, play Sonic R on that. Because the PC version looks really bad compared to the original console version.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-14-98</font> <font size=+1>Info on Sonic Super Special #11.</font><br></b>
Lien-Na reporting: The Julie-su solo story in SSS#11 will be called "Shadows". Patrick Spaziante will pencil this story.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-14-98</font> <font size=+1>Reporter Needed!</font><br></b>
Currently we need a reporter who could do weekly summaries of the Sonic The Hedgehog newsgroup on Usenet. If you are interested in helping us out, email <a href="mailto:zw@rocketmail.com">me</a> and we'll go over the details.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-13-98</font> <font size=+1>San Diego Comic-Con International Starts Today!</font><br></b>
One of the biggest comic-cons of the year has finally arrived. We'll put up an exclusive report by tonight or tommorrow. And if you are going, you might want to bring an issue or too for the Archie crew to sign autographs.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-13-98</font> <font size=+1>Dreamcast Demo Disk.</font><br></b>
Currently this is a rumor. But according to Magic Box, Sega will be releasing a Dreamcast demo disc which will include video footage of several games, such as Scud Race, D2, and <b>Sonic Adventure</b>. The disc will be packed in with the October issue of Sega Saturn Magazine in Japan. No word if Sega of America will also do something like this.
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-11-98</font>  <font size=+1>Australian's Luck Runs Out?</font><br></b>
About the rumor that was reported yesterday, here's what FGNonline has to say about it:
<p><i>Rumors of a November Dreamcast launch in Australia have been branded a load of kanga-hooie by our sources. National radio reports in Australia had suggested that Sega would test the launch before Christmas. But magazine editors have emailed us to set the record straight. One commented: "This just isn't the case. I think someone here has got confused again. The same thing happened with the release of Cruisin' World, which was supposed to come here first but still hasn't arrived." He added: "I wish it were true, but given Sega's set-up here, it just doesn't seem possible."</i>
<p>Well then, guess the Dreamcast won't be released down under this November... 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-11-98</font>  <font size=+1>Ken Penders On San Diego Comic-Con.</font><br></b>
Ken's already on his way to San Diego, but this is what he said before he left:
<p><i>As far as I'm aware of, the following will be attending San Diego, though not necessarily hanging out in Artists Alley as I'll be doing:
<p>Rich Koslowski, Harvey Mercadoocasio, Andrew Pepoy, Jim Amash, Jeff Powell, Scott Shaw!, myself and Justin Gabrie, who'll probably be hanging out around my table on Sunday, August 16.
<p>In addition, my significant other Bernie is representing Pat Spaziante and Manny Galan as she'll be offering for sale select pages and covers ranging from $50 to $150. Pat has personally autographed a number of covers, along with two of the frontispieces from the KNUCKLES: DARK VENGEANCE storyline. (Julie-Su and Enerjak, both extremely suitable for framing.)</i>
<p>Well, the show starts this Wednesday, so make your plans quick!
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-10-98</font>  <font size=+1>Australian Sonic Fans Are In Luck...</font><br></b>
Triple J, a national radio station in Australia announced that Dreamcast will launch there this November. Apparently a few Japanese companies have been testing their products in nearby Australian markets before hitting the US and Europe. But if this is the case, well, let's just say if you're living in Australia, you could be playing Sonic Adventure about eight to nine month before the rest of us... 
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-9-98</font>  <font size=+1>AOLers Get The Boot On #sonic !!!!</font><br></b>
WB reporting: Well folks here's the skinny - Due to certain nameless AOLers that have repeatedly spammed the board, threatened the ops, cursed, swore, and varios other offenses, the decision has been made by the operators of #sonic to temporarily ban all AOL users until this problem can be fixed. Placing on a ban on one sole person couldnt do it because they would only find a way to get around the ban. So while everyone else can get into #sonic NO AOLers can get in unless until the ban is lifted period. One rotten apple spoils the bunch.</p>
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">8-9-98</font>  <font size=+1>Would You Do It For A Scooby Snack ???</font><br></b>
WB reporting: For those fans of Manny Galan it seems he's gonna be guest penciling an issue of that mystery loving canine Scooby-Doo! The issue will be Scooby-Doo #16 - Printing 2 months from now. Here's the scoop directly from DC Comics:
