<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-29-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic "Running" On Dreamcast!</font><br></b>
We finally found a picture of Sonic running on Sega's 128-bit machine, the Dreamcast. Click <a href="https://web.archive.org/19980529000000/http://www.seganet.com/pics/iri10.jpg">here</a> to view it. From the picture, we sort of get a view of what the Sonic platform game for Dreamcast will be like. The Sonic looked very smooth, no triangular shaped head like in Sonic R. Everything looked round, you can even see the fingers. I say this is as good as the animation in "Toy Story". BTW, this was shown at the Sega of Japan conference to launch Dreamcast.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-29-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Comic Sales Clarification!</font><br></b>
OK, so I (Zifei) made a mistake. I put 135,000 copies a mouth for Sonic comic sales (total). But I asked <A HREF="mailto:Benny7dude@aol.com">Paul Castiglia</a> this week about this. And he said that the total sales number for a month is about 85,000 copies. The total printed copies are around 190,000. But more than 50% are returned from agents (newsstands) and are now in the Sonic Checklist. The total printed number is down 6.5%, but the sales number is up 4.4%. This is for 1996 and 1997, so it's pretty old stuff. And as you know, the Sonic comic sales is growing faster now after the END GAME SAGA. For a graph of the <b>direct sales</b> chart for the Sonic Comic, click <a href="/sonichq/geocities/EnchantedForest/Dell/7835/News_salesgraph.gif">here</a> (Note: this graph is an exclusive of Sonic HQ). If I have time, I'll make one for Knuckles sales, too.  
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-29-98</font>  <font size=+1>E3: Sonic R PC!</font><br></b>
Sonic R is coming to PC this fall. The computer game will be a direct port from the Sega Saturn version. The details in the game look the same as the Saturn version, but the frame rate is slower. Nothing is known to be changed right now.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-29-98</font>  <font size=+1>Knuckles #15 Release Date!</font><br></b>
Knuckles #15 will be released on June 3, 1998 in comic stores around the US. So save $1.75 now!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-29-98</font>  <font size=+1>Information About Sonic Underground...</font><br></b>
And this is from Ken Penders:
<p><i>Archie lobbied for making the new Sonic series be based on the Sat. AM version, but DIC said no and Sega apparently is happy with the version DIC is doing and allowed it to proceed.  It will be out in _April_ (?) 1999, in syndication. Archie won't change the Sonic comics because of "Sonic Underground".</i>
<p>Ken also said that he and Mike Kanterovich were slated to write one or two scripts for the original third season Sat. AM show, one involving a story where Sonic and Robotnik switched bodies and Robotnik/Sonic followed Tails back to Knothole. Now, one source told us if the production artists draw it fast enough, the cartoon will be out by this fall. But if it does release in April of next year, that's fine with us...Sega does need a lot of commercial marketing to launch their Dreamcast in the States.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-29-98</font>  <font size=+1>Teasers from Ken...</font><br></b>
This is from Ron Bauerle of the Sonic Mailing List:
<p><i>Finally, he gave us a couple of _big_ teasers about Knuckles and Sally; all I'll say is that Dan got it half-right in one of his fan-fics...</i>
<p>Well, Dan stood for Dan Drazen. And I suppose the fan-fic Ron's talking about is Sally Quest (it's in our fan-fic page!). What does this mean? We are also clueless, it can mean Sally will go on a quest of her own (another Sally mini-series?). We'll ask Ken Penders about this.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-22-98</font>  <font size=+1>Some Small Comic News.</font><br></b>
MilesPrwr Reporting: Some minor news for the sonic comic. 1)"Antoine's Quest" from Battle Royal has no continuation plans. 2)Dulcy's mom has no planned returns. That's all.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-22-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sega DC Sonic Shown!</font><br></b>
Well, right after SoJ showed a Sega DC generated face of the Sega President in the Sega announcement ceremony of the Sega Dreamcast, Sonic poped up for a few seconds with the famous ring sound. There are no screen shots of it, but we'll bring it to you first when we find it.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-22-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Underground News!</font><br></b>
WB reporting: This is official and was taken from a one line post from Toon Magazine. It is not known whether Sonic Underground will be produced in time for the new season BUT it is known that Sonic Underground is to be a Prequel to all Sonic series. It's set for Fall ‘98. Interesting...could this be the cartoon that combines the Freedom Fighters with Sonic and Tails?
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-22-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Comic Sales Drop!</font><br></b>
Archie Comic's Sonic the Hedgehog Comic issue #61 direct sales dropped 1.9%. This place the comic as the 200th best selling comic in direct sales in America. Sonic is the best selling comic of Archie as usual. For Sonic #61, 7,800 copies were sold in direct sales (comic store only). Overall sales of this issue is around 85,000 copies.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-22-98</font>  <font size=+1>Ken Penders Website Is Up!</font><br></b>

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-21-98</font>  <font size=+1>Official: Sega Dreamcast!</font><br></b>
Yep, it's official now. Sega of Japan announced their new 128-bit "super" gaming system this morning. The Sega Dreamcast (DC) can push more than 3 million polygons per second and is more than ten times more powerful than the current day superior system, the N64. To view a picture of Sega DC, click <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/19980521000000/http://www.seganet.com/pics/dreamcast1.jpg">here</a>. The system will be released in Japan on November 20th, and fall of 1999 in N.America, Europe, and the rest of the world. There were no demos of the games shown, they would be shown later this year in September-October when Sega go on a gaming tour in Japan to launch the Sega DC. No Sonic games were shown. The system will be shown to the American Press on May 27th at E3.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-21-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic R PC</font><br></b>
Sonic R is currently being ported to PC. It will be a direct port, which means there would be no new stuff on the PC version. But you nerver know...
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Happy Birthday to You!</font><br></b>
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Sonic and Knuckles, happy birthday to you! And many more...yep, Ken Penders just reveiled that:
<p><i>
BTW, we also celebrate Sonic's birthday in SONIC #68 and Knuckles' in KNUCKLES #25, officially establishing the ages of a number of characters at that time for the benefit of readers who
keep asking.
<p></i>
So Sonic is actually older than Knuckles. Neat huh?
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Special Rerelease Time!</font><br></b>
OK, the specials are In Your Face Special, Sonic & Knuckles Special, and the Sonic & Knuckles: Mecha Madness Special. They will be rereleased in July. Or you can just use the Sonic Checklist in the comics to get them.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Ken's Responce to the King</font><br></b>
Here's Ken Pender, the Sonic Comic writer's responce to all the heat between Sally and King Acorn in Issue 60 about the marriage problem (on stands now):
<p><i>
In the coming months, the King will probably not be as sympathetic a character as he was shown in the cartoon for many reasons, all of which are valid. If he was, we probably would have no tension or readers wondering what's going to happen next. And if readers are in this much angst over the King in SONIC #60,
wait'll they get a load of developments over the coming issues,
especially KNUCKLES #19 through #21 and SONIC #68.</i>
<p>Keep in mind that Ken's hinted that something major will happen in Sonic the Hedgehog #69...Robotnik's return or a death of a character? 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic R 2?</font><br></b>
Is a Sonic R sequel coming to Sega's Next System? Well, from this statement, you can see that it is very possiable.
<p><i>
SEGA has worked very closely with a group of developers by providing them with early development kits and allowing access to SEGA's Japanese designers.<br>
Based on the above information, one would expect that Traveller's Tales would be one of SEGA's favored developers, as this game development company worked closely with SEGA's Japanese designers on Sonic R. SEGA did provide to Traveller's Tales the layouts of each level, and gameplay information. It has already been rumored that a Sonic R sequel will be headed to the Katana! One can only hope for this, as this was one amazing title and continues to amaze me on what the head programmer: Jon Burton of Travellers Tales was able to do on the Saturn!</i>
<p>Yeah, just think of what a Sonic Racer in a arcade perfect environment would look like! Rock on Sonic! (Source: Saturn 2 Tech Page) 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Surprise Release of SNS!</font><br></b>
Rumors have it that Sega of Japan will launch their 128-bit system next month in Japan. This is very likely because as of now three games are ready to go (No Sonic). Japan doesn't need Sonic to launch the system. When the Sonic game is finished, N. America and Europe will launch the system. We'll know for sure when Sega offically announce the SNS on May 21st.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-15-98</font>  <font size=+1>Emotional Scene Coming Up!</font><br></b>
Ken recently informed the Sonic Mailing List that some emotional scenes are coming up for the Sonic the Hedgehog comic. Here's what he said:
<p><i>One other thing I didn't address in my last posting.  Regarding SONIC, we are currently gearing up for an epic feel to Sonic, giving it a greater depth than the book has ever had, putting it more on equal footing with KNUCKLES, which a lot of readers have come to feel is the better of the two books.  I've
seen the storylines that are in production.  I'll be surprised if there's a dry eye after the heartfelt developments in SONIC #66.
<p></i>
This make me feel a lot better. at least there would be another emotional issue. I just hope the Sega watchdogs don't do anything to stop Sonic from cring. And I hope this isn't another character dying...

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-8-98</font>  <font size=+1>More News about the Sonic Crossover!</font><br></b>
Here's a letter about the upcoming Sonic crossover between Sonic and Image characters. It is from Mania: Newsarama.
<p><i>       When JIM VALENTINO announced the Image non-line was coming to and end, he promised the CBI-N one of his next personal projects would be a bit of a surprise, and he wasn't just whistlin' Dixie...Valentino tells us he will be pencilling this October's SONIC (the Hedgehog) SUPER SPECIAL #7 from Archie Comics, a 40-page one-shot will that crossover with several Image universe characters that the creator will draw in the "Batman Adventures animation style".<br> 
       Written and inked by Ken Penders, the story will co-star Sonic, Knuckles the Echidna and friends, along with Union, Velocity, ShadowHawk, the Savage Dragon and the Maxx. Spawn makes a cameo appearance. "This is an epic adventure for all ages that's not a dream, hoax, or imaginary story," said Penders. "When a mysterious figure makes off with the fabled Chaos Emerald, it's up to our heroes to recover it from the hands of the most evil force imaginable before he refashions reality to suit his own unique vision!"<br> 
       "Why this?" Valentino asked himself. "Well, first off, I am having an absolute BLAST with it! I haven't drawn 'cartoony' characters in a long time and I forgot how much I enjoy it. More, I've never done a 'funny animal' book before, so this was a new challenge and I wanted to try my hand at the 'Adventures' style of artwork. On another level, if you talk to retailers out there, you'll discover that the Sonic books are hot and getting hotter, this is a title that is outselling most DC, Marvel and Image books in most stores and I think this makes a good 'introduction' juncture. It may introduce straight super-hero fans to a line of books that are FAR more sophisticated than one would think and, simultaneously, introduce the younger Sonic readers to super-heroes. Everyone complains about the next generation of comics READERS? They're reading Sonic! At any rate, the whole thing came about thanks to my 11-year old son, Joel (the model for Timmy Silver in A TOUCH OF SILVER), who's a very big fan of the Sonic books."</i>
<p>
Well, that's it. Here's something from Paul Casitglia, Promotional Director of Archie comic about the upcoming crossover:
<p><i>The truth is not only out there, it's WAAAAY out there as the Chaos Emerald, the power source that maintains the Floating Island's place in the sky, is stolen by a mysterious enemy, forcing SONIC, KNUCKLES and the rest of the Freedom Fighters to
hit the Cosmic Interstate in search of the priceless gem. Where they wind up is a world unlike any they've ever seen before as they find themselves on the mean streets of New York and beyond, teaming up with with [sic] an assortment of heroes such as ShadowHawk, the Savage Dragon, Union, Velocity and others, in an
effort to restore things to the way they used to be. Can they do it? Or do the bad guys really win out in this 40-page epic adventure? Trust no one but the creative team of Ken Penders and Jim Valentino for the answers to this one.</i>
<p>Also, we know that the comic special will be drawn in Batman Adventure style. For a preview drawing of the comic, click <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/19980508000000/http://www.mania.com/gifs/comics/penders.gif">here</a>.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-8-98</font>  <font size=+1>Where's Harvo?!</font><br></b>
Well, if you been wondering who's been inking the Sonic the Hedgehog comic covers lately. It's still Harvo, only in Japanese characters. That's what Ken Penders' saying... 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-8-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Issue 61 Release Date</font><br></b>
Archie Sonic the Hedgehog comic issue #61 will be released on May 20, 1998.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-8-98</font>  <font size=+1>SNS For May 1999?</font><br></b>
Rumors from the net have stated that Sega's 128-bit monster system will be released in Japan around October/November. The system would be in N. America by May next year and Europe by fall next year. Even though Bernie Stolar, the President and COO of Sega of America strongly denies it, there still could be a chance of an N. American release before Christmas of this year.
<p><HR size="2" width="70%">
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-1-98</font>  <font size=+1>Karl Bollers and Sam Maxwell to Appear!</font><br></b>
The two Sonic artist/writer/colorist will also be appearing at the Big Apple Comic Book Show in New York City on June 6 along with Spaz, Penders, and Galan.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-1-98</font>  <font size=+1>Official: SNS Will be Shown on May the 21st!</font><br></b>
Sega of Japan have officially announced that they will show the final stats and name plus the games for the 128 bit SNS (Sega's Next System) on May 21st. Bernie Stolar, the President and COO of Sega of America said that after the SoJ announcement, he will officially start the commercial push for the launch of the system. We should be able to see the Sonic game(s) really soon. This page will have coverage of the SoJ announcement, so check out this page on May 21st!
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">5-1-98</font>  <font size=+1>New Sonic Fan Comic!</font><br></b>
Yep, there's a new Sonic fan comic in town, and guess what, I'm (Zifei) the cover artist! This comic, according to the editor in chief, Gen Fluke, will be just as good as the Archie Sonic the Hedgehog series. And the best part is there would also be emotion running in this comic. Right now, issue 1 is still in the drawing stage. This issue would take place about the time of Robotnik's coup (coup: the overthrow and take over of a government). Go to this <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/19980501000000/http://members.tripod.com/~ChaosAdventures/index.html">page</a> for more information.
