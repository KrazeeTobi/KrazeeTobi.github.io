Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:lipscomb@i-55.com">Star Hedgehog</a>, we now have Real Vedio versions of the Sonic Saturday Morning Cartoon on the net! The first episode put up is Sonic Boom, the one where Sally go to the Iron Lock prison. It is downloadable in three parts.

It looks cool. Click <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/19980630000000/http://www.kenpenders.com/sonimgl.jpg">here</a> to view it! From the way it is colored, I say it's done by one of the Image guys and not Heroic Age.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-27-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic The Hedgehog Gets A Whole New "Image"!</font><br></b>
You can consider this an official press release of Sonic Super Special #7 since it is put out by Diamond Previews. Here it is:
<p><i>       This month, Archie Comics, in association with Image Comics, presents the most off-beat team up of all, as Sonic and his friends plunge head-first into the Image Comics universe! It all takes place in Sonic Super Special #7, a 48-page, full-color special. The action starts when Sonic, Knuckles, and the rest of the Freedom Fighters hit the Cosmic Interstate in search of a priceless gem that controls the fate of their existence. Where they wind up is a world unlike any they've ever seen before, as they find themselves on the mean streets of New York and beyond, teaming up with an assortment of heroes whose pectorals are bigger than some of the Freedom Fighters’ entire bodies!<br>
       "This is an epic adventure for all ages that's not a dream, hoax, or imaginary story," said writer Ken Penders. Yes, those defenders of the Sonicverse meet in a head-on collision with the world of Image, and come face to face with ShadowHawk, the Savage Dragon, the Maxx, Union and Velocity. Not to mention Spawn, who turns up in what has to be the most memorable cameo appearance of all! The Image characters will be rendered in the distinctive style of Batman: The Animated Series, by none other than Image co-founder Jim Valentino.</i>
<p>Maybe this will be the break through special for Sonic to gain more fans from the upper age group...

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-26-98</font>  <font size=+1>Queen Acorn!</font><br></b>
Here's something from Ken's webpage:
<p><i>At the moment, I can't say too much about KNUCKLES #19, as this is the start of one of the most anticipated stories yet, wherein we begin to answer a question that Sonic fans have asked ever since the series began. "Whatever Happened to Queen Acorn?"</i>
<p>So, just a few month's wait to find out! Can't wait, huh?
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-26-98</font>  <font size=+1>Knuckles #16 Release Date!</font><br></b>
Archie Comic Knuckles the Echidna issue #16 will be released in comic stores across America on July 8th, 1998. 
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-26-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sega to Support Sonic...</font><br></b>
In an interview done by Sega Saturn Magazine with Sega Entertainment president Shoichiro Irimajiri. Irimajiri stated that Sonic will remain the major mascot of Sega. Here's the exact quote:
<p><i>There is no question about Sonic. He will remain as the major character for Sega. We want to create lots of new characters for Dreamcast. Sony is trying to make Crash Bandicoot a major character. I think they has a great desire to have big characters.</i>
<p>This could mean more Sonic games for Dreamcast and PC.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-19-98</font>  <font size=+1>More Sonic Underground Info!</font><br></b>
Sonic12321 reporting: I found an Animation Magizine. There is a section of listings for an annual animation convention. Skiming around I noticed (under the comedy listings) Sonic Underground. It was right between Sam&Maxand Spy Dogs on the listings. What could this mean? The cartoon will be an action comedy.
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-19-98</font>  <font size=+1>Is that Sonic?</font><br></b>
Recently a few pictures of a game surfaced on the internet. It is taken by hidden cameras at the Sega Dreamcast reveiling show. Most people said it's a Sonic game, others disagreed. Here is one of <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/19980619000000/http://www.seganet.com/pics/dcsonic1.jpg">them</a>. You be the judge.  
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-19-98</font>  <font size=+1>Clarification!</font><br></b>
Jerry P. reporting: The report from May 15 says that Ken's hinting at something big in #69. I talked with Ken recently, and he said the something big will be in #68 along with the birthdays. Do I smell a big round guy named Robuttnik?
<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-19-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Anime News!</font><br></b>
Good news for you anime fans:
<p><i>Not sure if this has been said by anyone else, but the catalog ADVisions had at project A-Kon had a section about the Sonic Anime.  They have the rights it seems, no date has been set yet, and no word if they can get Jaleel White to come back and do Sonic's voice. Since AD releases both in the US and UK it should be on its way this fall to both of us.</i>
<p>Happy now?

It is true that Ken Penders will have them "married" in Knuckles: Twenty Years Later special coming up later this year. However it is very unlikely for us to see them actually getting married. Ken recently mentioned something about if Sonic remains the mascot of Sega, you'll never see him settle down.

Now we at Sonic HQ will have information about UK's Sonic The Comic thanks to <A HREF="mailto:dave@bulmers.demon.co.uk">Dave Bulmer</a>. Here's what he said about STH #131:
<p><i>"Shady Characters" part 1, by Lew Stringer
This issue and next, Lew Stringer managed to prove that he can write really enjoyable stories when he's allowed to. For some reason the editor Deborah Tate always makes him write rubbishy stories about Fabian Vane or giant oranges, but this issue he gets to do something important, and here it is.</i>

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-8-98</font>  <font size=+1>Why Have The Sonic Comics Been So Bad Lately?! - Let The Truth Be Told And What You Can Do About It?</font><br></b>
<b>****IMPORTANT NEWS****</b>
<p>WB Reporting: This is taken <b>VERBATIM</b> as it was stated from Dan Drazen's review of Sonic 61. As many know, Dan is the official review man as appointed by J. Freddy Gabrie so all that is said here MUST be true -
<p><i>Now It Can Be Told: It may have occurred to some readers that the last few issues of Sonic comics has been a little on the lame side. Ever since the blue blur and his two-tailed bud left Knothole to undertake what Ron Bauerle called "Sonic and Tails' Excellent Adventures" the cover stories have been less than inspired. Mostly they've consisted of fights with enough narrative thrown in to qualify as a story. The back stories by Ken Penders, on the other hand, have outshone the cover material while doing so with fewer pages (and, if one need edit, without Sonic or Tails anywhere in sight). And #61 continues this sorry state of affairs. Fans have to be wondering what the head honchos at Archie Comics must have been thinking to let this come to pass. Well, my sources inform me that it hasn't entirely been Archie's fault--at least, they didn't PLAN for it to happen.
The stories had been laid out for 1998 and assigned to the
various writers and artists quite some time ago.  At some point,
however, one of the members of the creative team (who shall remain nameless) informed Archie that he couldn't meet the deadlines for the material he'd been assigned.  After essentially being told "Tough noogies, Archie, it's your problem now," the management at Archie Comics had to scramble to pour material into the now-empty spaces of several issues.  They never publicly admitted this on any of the lists--it would be like the hostess of a fancy dinner party announcing to the guests that she's just turned the standing rib roast into a large charcoal briquette and would everybody please be patient while someone makes an emergency run to the Colonel's for
something that maybe we can pass off as chicken marinara if we
drown it in enough Ragu.  That kind of damage control is very much in evidence in this issue.</i>
<p>So what does this mean? This is extremely significant to the future of Sonic because of the fact that the story quality, with exception possibly being Sonic 58 and TOTFF backups, has plunged dramatically. And now we know the reason why! As one of the writers or artists decided to become rogue, everyone else had to fill in for the mess that was made! Thus in an attempt to correct the situation and fill in the empty spaces, too many writers and too many artists took on a task that overall has bogged down the plot as Sonic begins to suffer from what those in the Comics industry call "The Spider Man Syndrome". With the round robin writers and artists, Sonic can't maintain a stable continuity! So what can we - the readers do about it? Its already been announced that as of 62 Karl Bollers and Steven Butler will take the book to hopefully fix the trouble but Archie STILL needs to know how its readers feel (TRUTHFULLY!) about what has happened to the Sonic Comic Book! Located <A HREF="mailto:soniccolumn@archiecomics.com">here</A> is The Direct email to Justin Freddy Gabrie and located <A HREF="mailto:Benny7dude@aol.com">here</a> is the direct email to Paul Castiglia. ALL SONIC FANS!!! TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT SONIC #57 - #61!!!!! DO NOT BE VULGAR !!!! DO NOT FLAME !!! DO NOT SPAM!!!!! They give us these emails so that they can hear us and its time we used them! They can promise anything but it takes a group to get your voices heard and if the voices of sane people, not fan lists or constant flamers or whatnot, BUT HONEST TO GOODNESS FANS WHO DONT WANT TO SEE THIS KIND OF THING HAPPEN ANYMORE, speak loudly and tell them what you think then maybe, we can really see Sonic rise again. As much as anyone can say that "Sonic will make a comeback" it takes a kick in the rear to get a reaction! E-Mail Now and VOICE YOUR TRUE OPINION !!! This is not an editorial! Editorials make you sit up and think. This is said to make us SIT UP AND DO!!!! And if you really want to see Sonic rise again do it now! Thank you.

<p><b><font color="FD26BC">6-6-98</font>  <font size=+1>Sonic Team to Breakup?!</font><br></b>
Right now it's just an rumor, but this might turn out to be real. Why you ask? Well, the Sonic Team only mad three original games: Sonic 1, Nights, and Burning Rangers (All the other Sonic games are made by Traveler's Tales and Sega Technical Institute). All the programmers of the Sonic Team will remain employers of Sega. They probably will finish the Sonic DC game first. Keep in mind, this is a rumor.
