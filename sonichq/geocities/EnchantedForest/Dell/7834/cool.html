In the series created by DIC for ABC didn't Tails have an aunt?
I don't remember to much of it, all though I do remember that. I used to watch it. I am not a guru of it, but I am interested in it. Could you please tell me if this is so?<br>

<p>Look at it this way, we have to do work outside of the page that's more important...anyway, we're going to reshuffle the staff when we move the page. Then WB won't have to handle 3 huge pages and this page anymore.

<p>I don't know...for Mega Drive...they still sell Mega Drives around your place? If they do, you might find it in a retail store. If they don't, well, they're sold out on the games too.

Congrats on the website, I like it just as much as I like Sonic. You've worked very hard to do
this webpage. But I want to know, do you know anything about Sonic Anime? I've searched all of

Dear Sonic HQ, will Sonic anime be transfered to english and released in america?, if so, will sega take out the parts where Knuckles says... (I don't use this word) well... shit, and the parts where Tails clings on to Sera and pushes agenst her... chest parts?<br>

<p>I have heard tons of rumors on this...they might. But don't bet on it. And if they did, nothing will be cut out. But you never know...with the Sonic Adventure movie just around the corner.

Hi Sonic HQ! This is <b>Glory Wolfguard</b>! I got a few questions for your Q & A pagie:<br>
1. Did Knuckles ever make an appearance in Saturday AM Sonic?
2. What exactly is Antoine, a fox, coyote, or something else?
3.  What's wrong with your Features page? I keep clicking on links (Survey, Comedy) when I go to there, and it brings me to a GeoCities thing where the art takes forever to load, and it says the address doesn't exist.
</i></font color>
<p>1) No.<br>
2) Depend on the version. Archie says he's a coyote....<br>
3) It's not working? It's working now....

I was looking through the game info for Sonic 2 and saw that there was a
stage that was scrapped before the games release: Hidden Palace. It also
said that you could take a glimpse using a code. Well, it isn't in level
select, and it doesn't say how to see it in the code bank. So how DO you
get to see this place then? You can listen to the music only, as far as
I know. Please reply.<br>
<b>Philip Buccianti</b>
</i></font color>
<p>No, you can't play the game. As for a look, you have to get Game Shark (which they don't seem to sale anymore). Some Sonic 2 cartridges have the playable version, but they are very rare.

Dear Sonic HQ, <br>	
Hi! I got Sonic R for Sega Saturn a week ago and if anyone has trouble 
with getting the 4 secret characters( Mecha Sonic, Puppet Tails, Cyber 
Knuckles, and Egg Robo), I know who to use on them. 
Radical City- Puppet Tails- use Super Sonic if possible
Resort Island- Mecha Sonic- use Puppet Tails
Regal Ruin- Egg Robo- use Super Sonic
Reactive Factory- Cyber Knuckles- use Puppet Tails
I've done this, and I have even gotten all 4 of the hidden characters!<br>

Dear Sonic HQ, <br>	
I'm curious ... how exactly did Knuckles's ancestors dissapear?	NR<br>
<b>Net Raptor</b></i></font color>

<p>According to the comic - Knux's ancestors had been missing for over a century due to the fact of a nuclear holocaust incited bty The Dingo Armada. As oncoming missiles were heading for the island the guardian at that time - Hawking - used his Hyper Zone Projector to literally transport Echidnaopolis - located in the center of the Marble Garden Zone (Sonic 3) - , Dingo City and most animal life into sevaral "Pocket Zones" - similar to the zones we play in videogames. It was after they were transported to thier "zones" that the Island became a nuclear wasteland and it took over a century for the flora and fauna to grow back. During that time it was up to Hawking and Tobor, who were guardians during that time to get busy to restoring the Island. Over time ( Due to Haven's secrecy ) guardians were left out of the loop on this information and were left to defend the actual island itself ( after it had grown back ) with no knowledge of where thier people were - Athair, possibly Locke - BEFORE he found haven, and Knuckles. This explains why Knuckles had NO REASON of knowing what had happened to his ancestors (Sonic 3) - because all this time it had been hidden from him by those in authority (Haven). The thing that opened up the Echidnaopolis Zone and the Dingo City Zone, was the omega wave that was released when the Ultimate Annihilator exploded ( SSS6: Sonic 50 ) after that each zone was literally fighting itself for space but only one could exist. The rest is explained in "Knuckles: Lost Paradise".

Dear Sonic HQ, <br>	
Hi,  In response to Eric Purdy`s question, you can only access Super Tails 
in `Sonic 3 and Knuckles` after collecting both the complete set of 
Chaos Emeralds and Super Emeralds. (Excuse me if my knowledge is a bit 
rusty, but I couldn`t take my Genesis - or Megadrive as they call it 
over here in England - to university.)<br>

Hi Sonic HQ,<br>
I have some questions. 1. Who does the Sonic HQ staff
like
best,? Sonic, Psuedo Sonic, Silver Sonic, Metal Sonic, Cyber Sonic, Evil
Sonic, Super Sonic, or Mecha Sonic? <br> </i>

</font> <font color="02FD0F"> 
<p> Well of course NOTHING can top the original one and only !!! Psuedo is a wannabe, Silver is a prototype, Metal comes into a CLOSE second, Cyber is a plot device, Evil is a punk, Super ties in with regular cause he's the original - only more powerful, and Mecha is the original gone bad. <font color="D575EC"> </p>

<i>2. Can you put up more pictures of
Cyber Sonic? <br></i>

</font> <p> THAT is kinda hard to do. I can think of only ONE other GOOD pic of him due to the fact that he wasn't one of the main characters in Sonic 19 - even IF HE WAS a pivotal plot device. Look for a new pic of him later drawn by art Mawhinney.<font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>3. When I turn into Hyper Sonic in Sonic 3 & Knuckles for
Genesis using
debug mode he's okay, but when I do it in Sonic Jam, he's glitched,
why? <br></i>

</font> <p> Well debug is basically what it means - Dubugging. Going into something that wasn't meant to be an actual part of the game itself. BUT when I've seen people do the code it never glitched. Maybe its just something about your CD. <font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>4.
How on Mob...err.. earth do I get the dark blue Super Emerald in Sonic
3 &
Knuckles?! I can only get the spheres surronding the jump spheres!<br></i>

</font> <p> I cant very well map the course out for you BUT I know someone who already has - Koryan ( One of the best midi makers on the net) has made his "Get Blue Spheres" page as a map depicting how to get the Emeralds. Go to <A HREF="http://www.din.or.jp/~koryan/sonic_e/gbs/se_gbs.htm">Sonic Island: Get Blue Spheres</a> to find it. <font color="D575EC"></p>

 <i>5.
Do you
guys hope Metal Sonic, Metal Tails, Metal Knuckles, and Silver Sonic
get their
own action game?<br></i>

</font> <p> i highly doubt that will EVER happen. Most likely they will continue making appearnces in regular sonic games.<font color="D575EC"></p>

 <i>6. Why did Jules and Bernie look so stupid in Sonic
Brave new
world & look great in other issues? <br></i>


</font> <p>Let's just say Ken Penders makes a MUCH better writer than drawer for Sonic.....<font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>7. I know how Jules got
roboticized, but
how did Bernie? <br></i>


</font> <p> That's a question that hasn't been explored yet but will be, hopefully, in future issues. Most likely, as an assumption, she suffered the same fate as Uncle Chuck did and was caught it the Mobotropolis takeover by Robotnik. However this has not been proven and is only an educated guess.<font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>8. And speaking of Bernie, why did they only show her
before
she was roboticized in brave new world? <br></i>


</font> <p> I'm not sure what you meant in that question BUT I think youre saying why did they never show her in regular form instead of roboticised. If thats what it is - Its probably because the storyline at the moment didn't require it. maybe we'll see what she really looks like in the future.<font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>9.Why can't I order Sonic #25 &
#19
anymore?<br></i>


</font> <p> nine times out of ten its probably sold out.<font color="D575EC"></p>

 <i>10. Does Amy know that Sonic meet her cousin Rob? And speaking
of
Rob, what did Sonic mean when he said "You?! But I thought... when Rob
told
him he sent Amy there? <br></i>


</font> <p> Sonic hasn't even gotten back to Mobotropolis yet - even though he will in Sonic #68. And as far as that "You" comment - more foreshadowing by Ken Penders...<font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>11. Why did Jules & Bernie lose their 5th
fingers when
they were roboticized?<br></i>


</font> <p> Probably an artists mistake that has yet to be picked up on. VERY astute eyes for catcing that.<font color="D575EC"></p>

 <i>12. Why did Archie change Jules head in Brave
new world
from the one in Sonic #46? <br></i>


</font> <p> Redesigned is a better, and most likely, term - His original head design was a wee bit confusing on the drawing aspect. That OR it just falls back to differing artistic styles...<font color="D575EC"></p>

<i>13. Why are there more execlimation points
then
pereiods in the comic? Bye. <br></i>


</font> <p>Think about it like this, Which sounds better? Say these sentences out loud:</p>

<p> OH MY GOSH. LOOK OUT SALLY. THERES A BOMB COMING STRAIGHT FOR YOUR BIG FAT WATERMELON HEAD.</p>

<p>or..... OH MY GOSH! LOOK OUT SALLY! THERES A BOMB COMING STRAIGHT FOR YOUR BIG FAT WATERMELON HEAD!!!!!!</p>

<p> Exclamation points add more impact to sentences in comics rather than periods. It almost makes you more involved with the action taking place.</p>
