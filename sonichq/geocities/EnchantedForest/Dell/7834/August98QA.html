Hi, this is gonna sound really dumb and you're probably gonna go home and say to someone, "Let me tell you what this idiot asked me."  But anyway, today I downloaded the episode No Brainier on the Internet.  Y'know that part where Sonic knocks the Robotisizer off line, well, when Snively sees it, it sounds to me like he says, "Do I hafta do everything around here.  Damn!"  And that's not good language for a kid's show.  Can you tell me what he says? Also, did Knuckles ever appear on the Sat, AM?<br>
<b>Soneec</b></i></font color>
<p>Yes, it does sound like that, but remember that this is Snively we're talking about. He's voice can play trick on you...and no, Knuckles never showed up in the SatAM.

Why do you want to kill Sally off?!?!?!!! The one thing I don't like about half of the sonic comic audience is THAT THEY ALL WANT TO KILL SALLY OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now looky Sal' is a really good character if you killed her off then all the other Freedom Fighters would get canceld and then the comic would be just like The adventures of Sonic the hedgehog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now we don't want that to happen do we????!? There is only one character that I want to be killed......GEOFFERY ST.JOHN!!</i></font color>
<p>You know, you should go see a doctor! You get a bit carried away. First of all, Sally will NOT die, Sega will not allow that. And secondly, the second part of the message was uncalled for (that's why I didn't show it).

Its Nexus again. I came back to the Q&A page and saw that "Office Depot Customer" Was saying I was wrong. But like I said, Ken confirmed it. And why would Robotnik free Snivley when he was the one who killed Robotnik??? Although he is right that that sat dude might of freed the prisinors...and Ken also confirmed that they are planning the Sonic & Sally wedding in issue 100. I just thought you'd like ta know seeing that you all were a little clueless on that topic.<br>
<b>~SirNexusTH</b></i></font color>
<p>Are you sure that we're clueless? We just happened to be the ones to confirm that the hand's not Robotnik's. And Robotnik doesn't know Snively turned on him! And Sonic and Sally are not getting married in #100! That's confirmed by more than 3 sources! Most likely the people that's getting married are Bunnie and Antoine or St. John and Hershey.

Well, I've been a fan of Sonic for a few years and back in like the past few years, I never knew the comic book existed. I'm not a big fan to Sonic since I'm loyal to Super Mario, no offense. I just started buying the Sonic comics March 1998 so I don't know a lot yet. This is my only question for now. Why won't your Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog theme song wav. file work? It downloads fine on Winzip, but whenever I want to open it, it says Cannot open file: it does not appear to be a valid archive,  if
you downloaded this file try downloading the file again, and press H1 for help, and everytime I downloaded again, the same error message appears.<br>

This is just a rumor I heard, but is it true there's going to be a movie about the continuation of the ABC Sonic?  The story takes place when Doomsday is destroyed and snively plots revenge.  Now I also heard that Foo Fighters, Semi-Sonic, Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, and more are supposed to be on the soundtrack to kick Titanic's ass!  Supposidly, this movie is animated but

I just found your site and did not know if I should post this to youur Q&A section as I am not a member, if such is required. I have seen a number of posts on how many fingers Knuckles has.  Most Echidna's have three fingers and a thumb, as shown by several covers and pictures of Echidna's like Wyn and Knuckles mother, among others. The clincher that the glove is actually a type of boxing glove type affair is that on the cover of Knuckles the Echidna #10, the lead Echidna in the procession has a torn glove like Knuckles', showing his fingers and the slot where his index finger goes, leading people to believe that there is only a thumb, index finger, and hand.
Hope this helps.<br>

I have to say you are wrong on this one. Sonic is 15 when the series started wasn't he? Now in some of the comics it gives us a specific date. Now is that the same year that Robotnik overthrew Mobius? No! Because I also remember seeing somewhere it has been like this FOR YEARS so if possible the freedom fighters should be growing it's only for technical reasons and not because they just should. Also in the birthday issue will Sonic be turning 16? Thus saying it has been one year sence I turned 15 waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in issue 1? So I think that Mobian time has to be different than earth time and all is well.<br>
<b>Jesty</b></i></font color>
<p>Robotnik's coup took place when the Freedom Fighters were 5, but we basicly skipped over the ten years with Sonic Kids. Now to look at time on Mobius, you have to forget Earth's existance. Take End Game for example. This took place in less than 5 days on Mobius, but it took 4 month on Earth. So you just CAN'T compare Earth with Mobius. We're talking two different dimensions here. And as you know, our physics only work in OUR dimension.

Hi! My name is <b>Jeff</b>. This is more of a comment than a question really. People are using their recordings of Sonic the Hedgehog from the SAT AM T.V Show and are SELLING THEM! Forgive me for asking, but isn't that illegal? They're selling someone else's product and there is a $250,000,000 fine or a jail sentence for doing that. Is this illegal or can people do it? My second question is: Do you think Sally ever gets on Sonic's nerves? Although she's important in the comic and in the cartoon, she can be a real nag! I bet she gets on all of the Freedom Fighters' nerves, but they just don't say anythhing about it because she's higher power. I would tell her that she's annoying right to her face! I'd have no problem doing that! Well, thanks for listening to my questions and concern. Please answer my questions!</i></font color>
<p>Like you said yourself, they're selling the records, in other word they're selling the TAPES. That's not illegal. And Sally, do you have ANY prove that she gets on everyone's nerves? She might be getting on YOUR nerves and a few others...but not everyone's.

Hi.  I was wondering a lot of stuff about the Hidden Palace on Sonic 2. Someone told me if you collected all the rings and emeralds, after Wing Fortress, you'd be taken there.  But others say, he made that up and it's unaccessible.  (is that a word)  Anyway, I was wondering..

2. Do you know if that code works?<br>
3. Where can I buy a Pro Action Replay for SEGA Genesis?  (I know the code for that is, FFFE1 00008.)<br>
4. For the Hidden Palace code, I rented a game Genie and did the code that way a whole buncha times and wouldn't you know it, it never worked.  How was I supposed to access it, push start at the title screen?<br>

<p>OK, Hidden Palace was supposed to, according to some, be in Sonic 2. But Sonic 2, like most of the other Sonic games, was rushed by Sega to keep up with public demands, so the level was never finished.<br>

1) Yes, at least I heard it's a yes.<br>
2) Don't know.<br>

1.) What was the last issues Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts were in? They're pretty cool even though they're pretty stupid.<br>
2.) How did the Freedom Fighters capture Snively and send him to
Devil's Gulag Island?<br>
3.) Why do some people want Dr. Eggman from the Japanese Sonic games to be in the comic book now that Dr. Ivo Robotnik is gone?<br>
4.) How does Sonic get restored to normal in Sonic vs. Knuckles: Mecha Madness?<br>
5.) Is Sonic's Friendly Nemesis Knuckles the Knuckles mini-series that had Knuckles battle Enerjak?<br>
6.) Where can I find a .wav or .mp3 of the title music to Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog?<br>
7.) I heard that Metal Sonic returned after his "melt-down" in Sonic issue #25, and he got the look he had from the video game Sonic and Knuckles. What issue did Metal Sonic make his comeback and how did the Freedom Fighters stop him that time?<br>
8.) When I meant that did Tails ever use his tails as a fan propulsion blade, I meant did he ever do this to make himself run faster like he does in the video games?<br>
9.) I'm a bit confused about the Floating Island and Echidnapolis
thing. How did the city disappear from the island, how did it reappear, and how do Knuckles and the Chaotix get there?<br>
10.) Would the Chaotix be considered a Freedom Fighter group, and when did Knuckles meet them?<br>
11.) Do the Power Rings make Sonic go faster in the comic book, and is he the only one who can use them?<br>
That's all the questions for now until I can think of more.</i></font color>
<p>Well, here we go again!<br>
1) Scratch And Grounder - #10, Grounder Cameo - #15, Coconuts - #30.<br>
2) They captured him in Robonik's command center in Brave New World.<br>
3) Hmm...Eggman, Robonik...same guy...<br>
4) Nicole used the energy from the billionth ring.<br>
5) Yes, but that's not the only issues he battled Enerjak.<br>
6) Check our cartoon info page soon.<br>
7) In the Knuckles Chaotix special and thanks to the use of the Power Gems he morphed into Hyper Metal Sonic The superhuge RED version of Metal Sonic.<br>
8) Yes, check Sonic #52.<br>
9) Long story, go <a href="http://www2.andrews.edu/~drazen/archives.html">here</a> to read the reviews of Knuckles #4-#6.<br>
10) They all met in the Knuckles Chaotix special. They are not considered a Freedom Fighter group but lend a hand when needed. thier true goal is to protect the Floating Island whenever Knuckles is away. THE ORIGINAL CHAOTIX were Mighty, Vector, Charmy, Espio, Heavy, And Bomb. The NEW CHAOTIX are Mighty, Vector, Espio, Julie-Su, Charmy ( Though he has taken leave to fulfill duties as a prince, and Constable Remington (To give assignments in Knuckles absence).<br>
11) Appearently, Sonic still goes faster with a power ring, but anyone with a "heart" can use them.<br>

Dear Sonic HQ,<br>
Many are wondering what that hand is. I can say this..... It is
not the hand of Robotnik. I can't tell who it is but it is definatly not him. They killed him off for a number of reasons that was best for the writers and the comic itself. And he is not due back for any cameo appearance ever! Thank you and good night,<br>
<b>~(Sir) Nexus J Hedgehog</b></i></font color>
<p>Yes, Ken Penders confirmed in the Sonic HQ interview about a month ago that the hand's not Robotnik's. But to say that he's not coming back is a little extreme. This is Robonik we're talking about here...the Sega character...Archie don't have the right to kill him off.

Hi, I`m a British Sonic fan who`s only just got online within the last couple of weeks, and although I`ve heard of them, I`ve never seen an Archie Comic in my life (the U.K`s Fleetway country, and it sounds like we`ve drawn the proverbrial short straw as far as quality`s concerned) As a Tails maniac, I`m fascinated by the story of Fiona; is there any chance of me seeing a picture of her? And if it makes anyone feel any better, we simply don`t have ANY videos of the SatAM series over here. I`ve been hunting for an importer for literally years. Thanks (and in the unlikely event of you ever needing help with questions about the British side of Sonic, mail me anytime),<br>

<p>Oh yes...Fiona...hmmm, I'll tell you that she's a robot made by Robotnik and she first appeared in Tails' solo mini-series. And also that at the time Dave Manak drew her...so it's a bit on the ugly side. I'll ask one of the Sonic HQ members to scan a picture, when they do scan it, it'll be on the comic scans page in the comic info section. And as for the SatAM cartoons, they're on the net, check the news page for details.

In issue 18 when Julayla is talking to sally she says "Though you might have longed for other paths, the duties of your birthright CAN NOT be denied." So I'm wondering if king Acorn really has the power to do what he said he would do in issue 60.

<p>Good point, tell that to Ken Penders...

Guess who :)! Do you think that Knuckles is becoming the favorite
because of the Freedom Fighter breakup?  I saw in a Sonic HQ survey that Knuckles was becoming the favorite.  Or do you think that the Knuckles comic is better?<br>
<b>Jeff1089</b></i></font color>
<p>Well, the survey only accounts for the internet Sonic fans. The Sonic comic right now is still outselling the Knuckles comic by at least 10,000 copies each month. So, no, Sonic is still way popular.

Hello. I have a few questions for you, alright?<br>
1.) Where do Mighty and Ray live on Mobius in the SegaSonic (Japanese) version of Sonic?<br>
2.) How old is Mighty and Ray?<br>
3.) What kind of Squirrel is Ray?<br>
4.) Whatever happend to Ray in the U.S. version of Sonic?<br> Thanks!!!<br>
<b>~Brian</b></i></font color>
<p>Well, here are the answers:<br>
1) Mighty's on the Floating Island, and don't know where Ray lived...<br>
2) Mighty's 15, and don't know about Ray...<br>
3) Flying.<br>
4) Hmm...don't know again...Ray only appeared in ONE game, so he's not that popular.

Hi I am <b>Falcon</b>, I can answer a few questions you can't. For the person with the question about Sonic CD, you have to hang out on the conveyor belt while Robotink's device grinds agianst the conveyor belt and sometime around that will defeat him. Oh, Sonic is a name Sonic made up himself because his real name is Maurice Wentworth Hedgehog , it says so in the Archie comic Sonic the Hedgehog No.53.</i></font color>
<p>Thanks for your help...and Wentworth? Where did it say that in Sonic #63? To my knowledge, Sonic's real first name was never told in the comics...
