Hi! I'm Jeff! I like to ask you question about your page.Well here it is,why when I click to see a preview on a few up coming issues on the comic preview page,why does it show sonic webrings? Thanks!! Your site is the best!!!<br>
<b>Jeff</b></i></font color>
<p>Currently, some of the preview covers are not available. That's because we preview the issues more than two month before the actual preview pop up on the net.

Hi! This is my second or third time in this page. By the way, it
looks nice. I have a few questions (about 13 or more). I only have 20+ Archie Sonic related comics, so I don't know a lot about it. These questions are geared towards the Archie Sonic comics and the U.S. Sonic cartoons. Here are the questions.<br></center>
1. In the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon, Sonic is able to fly when he does his Sonic Triple Spin, but in the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon and comic book he can't. What is with Sonic flying in Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog?<br> 
2. Has Tails ever used his tails as a fan propulsion blade in the U.S. Sonic cartoons and the Archie comic book?<br> 
3. How did Sally get Nicole?<br>
4. Have the Knothole Freedom Fighters ever been to the Little Planet in the comic?<br> 
5. Has Amy Rose from the Archie comics ever used Dao Jing tarot cards?<br> 
6. When did Antoine start getting braver?<br> 
7. In Sonic the Hedgehog #18, Julayla was a cat, but why does she look different in Sonic Super Special #5: Sonic Kids?<br> 
8. If you lock on Sonic 3 with Sonic & Knuckles, there are 7 Chaos Emeralds, 7 Super Emeralds, and the Master Emerald. How many Chaos Emeralds are there on the Floating Island in the Archie comics?<br> 
9. Has the Power Ring Generator ever appeared in the Archie comics?<br> 
10. What happened to Nack the Weasel after Sonic Triple Trouble in the Archie comics? All I know is he ended in the Devil's Gulag Island.<br> 
11. Have the Flickies ever appeared in the Archie comics?<br> 
12. Do Archie Comics plan on bringing Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts in for a special appearance in the future? I know they were in there in the beginning.<br> 
13. Do Archie Comics have plans for bringing all the Sonic comics they made and having a special sale on them when the 100th issue comes out? I want some of the unavailable back issues.<br>
<b>Compaq</b></i></font color>
<p>A lot of Q's hmm? Time for an answer!<br>
1) That cartoon was for kiddies, so they bring a bunch of non-sense moves to get the kids exited.<br>
2) Yes, Sonic #61.<br>
3) Sally send the computer back from the future.<br>
4) No, #25 was as close as it gets.<br>
5) No.<br>
6) Sonic issue #46.<br>
7) Different artist draw her differently, that's considered normal in the comic industry:-)<br>
8) Right now, only the Master Emerald.<br>
9) No.<br>
10) Well, long story. Nack escape from Knothole prison, hits Sonic on the head and takes Sonic to Robotnik (Mecha Madness). Sonic comes back and capture Nack (#40). Nack then gets taken to Devil's Gulag. Now he just escaped from the place with the other crooks (#63).<br>
11) Yes, in Sonic Blast Special.<br>
12) Maybe, maybe not. 
13) No, to do that, they would hurt the market prices. In other words, the originals will not worth as much.<br><center>
Hope that helps out!

I'm not asking a question as much as answering one. I saw a Manga pic of Knux from Japanese comic and he had a full sey of fingers. It looked messed up. Knux may have a full set under that flap in his glove. My theroy is Knux's glove is more like a BOXING glove.<br>
<b>Sonic12321</b></i></font color>
<p>Think of it this way, Knuckles only have two knuckle joints, so how could he have five fingers? I say three.

Hi! When I asked if you could become Super Knuckles in Sonic 2 with Sonic & Knuckles, I meant if there is a code at the level select menu that gives you all emeralds so you don't have to collect them all the normal way( like playing the sounds 4, 1, 2, 6 at the level select menu that gives you all emeralds in Sonic 2 alone).<br>

Hello! I've noticed in the Sonic video games, Mighty the Armadillo acts almost exactly like Sonic, but in the Archie comic version, Mighty acts like Ray the Squirrel (simple, naive, bright and cheery!) Do you have any idea why he changed totally in the Archie comics version, to top it off, he even wears different sneakers (I've seen him wear 2 pairs of sneakers in the video games, one pair just like Sonic's and the other pair the same way, except for the white line around the soles of his sneakers and white soles.)? Sorry to ask you guys such a long question, 
but I really want to know! Thanks :-)<br>
<b>~Brian</b></i></font color>
<p>Actually, I don't think he changed. I'm sure Sega gave Archie a complete profile of their characters when they gave them the right to make the comics.

<b>hansen82</b></i></font color>
<p>Ending theme? Or do you mean the starting theme? Because the ending theme is the same as the starting theme...and the midi that's playing on sonic HQ's main page is the starting theme.

This is T2's lil' sis "Foxy". I was reading this one question my sister asked you guys, you know the question about how many fingers does Knuckles have? And you said TWO?!? That CANNOT be right!!! If Knux has two fingers then how come in the Sonic Anime there was this one screen shot of him pointing at himself, and you actually see a finger? So Knux prabably has FIVE fingers like ALL Sonic characters not TWO!!<br>
<b>-Foxy the Fox</b></i></font color>
<p>Having two fingers doesn't mean you can't point at yourself! Try this, tie up all your fingers (not thumb) with tape, then try to point at yourself. It works...

I order them if so? Who do I call to find them on tape? Right now, I am still waiting for a response from DiC Entertainment and Merchandise regarding this subject to find all the episodes.<br>

Hey staff, I never got the Sonic special with Merlin Prower in it, and I haven't got Sonic Super Special #5 yet, either. Yeah yeah, I know I should have it by now, but my nearby store doesn't sell the Super Specials so I have to order them, and I live in Canada, so it takes a while. =) Could I see a pic of him?

<p>Well...he's a knight only in the Kingdom of Acorn (which is Mobius). So when he's on the Floating Island, he's not a knight.

<p>The SatAM cartoons are hard to find, so you're not going to find any free ones around here anymore. But the good part is that someone just put one of the episodes on the internet in Real Media format (go to the news page, 6-30's update).

This is Agent 006% with very important questions from the head of my organization: 1. If Sally's last name is Acorn, Tails' last name is Prower, and Geoffery's last name is St. John, what are Sonic and Knuckles' last names(other than "Hedgehog and Echidna)? 2. I have recently heard about a not-so-good Sonic cartoon called "Sonic Underground." Is the cartoon REALLY going to be that bad? Also, what is the plot for the series? Will there be any other cartoons about Sonic that might come after it? 3. If Sonic marries Sally, and Knuckles marries Julie-Su, will they have to retire from saving Mobius, or will Tails take over?<br>
<b>Agent 006%</b></i></font color>
<p>Here's the answers:<br>
</center>
1) Sonic and Knuckles' last names are Hedgehog and Echidna, that's final because that's what Sega called them.<br>
2) Noone have any proof at all that the cartoon will be bad. Infact, the cartoon might turn out to be an excellent animated piece of work. The basic plot is Sonic, his brother, and sister fight against Robotnik and his swot-bots.<br>
3) As long as Sonic remains the mascot of Sega, you'll never see him actively marry. As for Knuckles, well...we'll have to wait and see. But know this, you'll never see Sonic and Knuckles retire.<center>
