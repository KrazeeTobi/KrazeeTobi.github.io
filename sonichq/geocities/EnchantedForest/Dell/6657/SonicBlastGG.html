A mysterious island has surfaced near Sonic's home - an island with a revoltingly familiar shape....The bald dome and walrus shape moustache are a total giveaway: Robotnik has built another floating platform to carry on with his plan of total domination of Mobius! After his Flicky Island Snafu, Robotnik is at it again and his newest invention - The Silver Castle - has arisen!!! Banding forces Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna decide there's only one thing to do: get to the platform, break inside, and do some serious property damage before thee Eggman can do his! Unfortunately, that is precisely what that eggheaded villain is counting on. You see Robotnik has set the whole thing up as a trap! Laying a laid series of traps he thinks are infallible. His plan is all too familiar: get rid of his nemesis Sonic for good, and once that's done, collect the Chaos Emeralds in order to gain the power he needs to take over the world!!!!! Travel with Sonic the Hedgehog or Knuckles the Echidna through a maze of traps, evil robots and fearsome scenery, and prove to Dr. Robotnik that there's no trap made that a determined Sonic or Knuckles can't overcome! But watch out - His latest assortment of tricks and traps is even nastier than usual....

An OK 2D Sonic adventure with traditional gameplay style, but clunky control and obvious emphasis on Donkey Kong Country -style rendered graphics. At least you could play as Knuckles...and the last level was kinda fun, in a maze-like way. I guess they're about the best graphics I've ever seen on Game Gear, but we all know what happens when graphics take a front-seat to gameplay... It was released in Japan under the name "G-Sonic". Basically, the Sonic equivalent of Virtua Fighter Animation. </p>

Green Hill Zone: Sonic (or Knuckles) starts out the adventure in a tropical forest. Hills and valleys abound, and rickety wooden bridges cross treacherous rivers. Watch out for the piranhas and coconut-tossing monkeys! 

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>Yellow Desert Zone: Bats, moving spike traps, quicksand... this Zone is all dune and no beach! When travelling in the Egyptian caverns, it's heads up - those stalactites have a nasty habit of falling down at just the wrong time. 

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>Red Volcano Zone: Whoops! Look out for flame balls circling around overhead! Dodge the fire serpents and flourescent bats, and use the springs to reach special items. 

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>Blue Marine Zone: It's time to get your feet wet! Explore the mysterious underwater ruins while searching for rings and things. When air gets low, a countdown begins - gulp the big air bubbles to replenish Sonic's oxygen before the countdown reaches zero. 

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>Single handedly THE BEST zone in the game! Silver Castle Zone: This chrome-plated castle is filled with Dr. Robotnik's most up-to-date mechanical monstrosities. Corkscrews, cannon-firing robots and steel spikes are just some of the dangers. Keep track of where transporters send you - things get confusing mighty quick!
