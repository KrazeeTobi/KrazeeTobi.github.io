After knocking Robotnik's recently re-launched Death Egg back outta the sky before it even left the atmosphere, the explosion sent Sonic and Tails back down onto Floating Island. They landed deep in the Mushroom Hills, while the Death Egg crash-landed on the top of Floating Island's largest volcano. Now there is no choice: Robotnik needs the Master Emerald to get his Death Egg back up and running, and Sonic knows it. Knuckles, a bit peeved with all the trouble by this point, decides it's time to stop taking names and start handing out punishments. Little does he know that even though he won't be battling Robotnik - he'll face a foe just as deadly! Now it's a mad three-sided race to the Master Emerald, and there can only be one victor....Created in October 14, 1997, Sonic and Knuckles was a revolutionary game because it was the first (and only game so far) containing Lock On Technology, which gave it the ability to hook up to other games. In this case, you could plug Sonic 2 or 3 into the top of the Sonic and Knuckles cartridge to play as Knuckles in those games. It boosted Sonic 3 even farther, Knuckles traveled over new ground in some zones and now there were 14 emeralds. Because of there being 14, you could now access Ultra Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Super Tails. You can also stick Sonic and Knuckles in the Genesis and play it on its own. The zones are about the same size as the ones in Sonic 3, and most of them have 2 acts. Some only have 1. Like Sonic 3, there is a boss in every act, except for Hidden Palace Zone. </P></center>

<p><b><center>The Code Bank - Sonic 3 Without Lock On</center></b></p>

<p>
<b>****NOTE**** See below first before trying these codes.</b> 

<p><b>Normal Level Select:</b> 
When the Sega logo comes up, just after the "Sega" theme is sung and the screen begins to turn black, quickly press: Up, Up, Down, Down, Up, Up, Up, Up to the beat of the drums. You should hear a ring chime if you did it correctly. A new Sound Test option should appear at the title screen. </p> 

<p><b>Mystery Level Select:</b> 
This code requires a Sonic 2 cartridge. Insert Sonic 2 and enter the Sonic 2 Level Select (play sounds 19, 65, 09, and 17). Return to the title screen, hold A and press Start. To transfer this to Sonic 3, hold A and carefully remove the cartridge without turning off the Genesis. Insert Sonic 3 and press Reset. Finally, release A and press Down twice at the main menu.</p> 

<p>Note: You might notice a few levels you haven't seen before, but you can't select them. Those levels were originally intended for the game, but were pulled in order to release the game on time. </p>

<p>
<b>Construction / Debugging Mode:</b> Enter the Level Select code, then press A + Start to choose your starting level. Once the action starts, press C to create an item, B to toggle between items, and A to select items. Alternatively, turn on the Genesis and press Up, Up, Down, Down, Up, Up Up before Sonic gets fully on screen.</p>

<p>If those methods don't work, try this. First you must have Sonic 2. Hook it up and put in the level select code, then put in the debug code and press START. When the screen with Sonic & Tails (Miles) pull out the game but DON'T turn it off and plug in Sonic 3. Now hold Up + A and press RESET.</p>

<p>When the main screen comes up press DOWN three times and you should see sound test go there hilight the level you want and hold A and press start. Now while playing press B turn into a sprite press A to change and C to paste it.</p> 


<p>
<b>Auto Super Sonic:</b> Input the level-select code. At the new Sound Test, play the following tracks: 1, 3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 6. You should hear a Ring chime. Select your Zone. Grab atleast 50 Rings, jump into the air, and press A, B, or C. 

<p>
<b>Changing Identities:</b> Use the debug mode cheat. Start any level that has a special stage ring. Next turn into your favorite object. As an object go to the center of a ring. Now hit B twice quickly. When you get out of the special stage you will look like that object for the rest of the level. 

<p>
<b>Battle Music In the Hydrocity Zone:</b> Just before Before you fight Robotnik in the Hydrocity Zone, act 2, the boss music will come. Keep Sonic's head under the shallow water until he is about to drown, then pop out of the water. You will hear the boss music from Sonic and Knuckles. 
<p><b>Easy Emeralds:</b> 

To gain all the chaos emeralds, enter the Level Select code, then highlight "Special Stage" and press C + Start. After receiving the emerald, press A + Start and repeat the process until you have them all.</p>

<p>Alternatively, enter the Sound Test code and play sounds 2, 4, 5, 6 in order. If you did it correctly, the Emerald sound will play.</p> 
 </TD>

<TD WIDTH="50%"><CENTER> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="COMIC SANS MS">

<p>
<b>Mecha Sonic And Mecha Tails:</b> Use the Debug Mode code in Launch Base act 2. Beat the game. When Sonic or Tails jumps towards you, activate Debug Mode and get out of it immediately. You will be able to use Sonic or Tails in the background for a short time, but they will look like robots. 


<p>
<b>Extra Lives At The Launch Base:</b> To do this trick you must get to the first level of the Launch Base Zone. Set off the first alarm, stop Sonic in the middle of it, and do a Spin-Dash attack. The flybots will continue to attack, and eventually their value will increase to 10,000 points! Every five flybots will gain you a life and, if you're patient enough, you can earn up to 99 lives! 


<p>
<b>900 Rings For Tails:</b> Enter Debug Mode then select a stage. Next press B, A (you must have Sonic and Tails on-screen.) When your cursor changes into a ring, paste it on Tails. Repeat this process and you can gain up to 900 rings and several 1-ups. 


<p>
<b>Random Start:</b> Enter the sound test menu choose a level. Look for a star post, touch it and hold A and press START. Then choose another level. If done correctly the title of the zone will change. Beware you might start out in a wall so use debug mode to fly out. 


<p>
<b>Nightime Play:</b> Enter the Level Select code, then press C + Start to choose your starting level. 


<p>
<b>The Missing Special Stage:</b> Access a special stage not found with Sonic and Knuckles!!!!!! For an all new bonus stage, enable Level Select, then play tune 1F. Finally, highlight stage 2 and hold A while pressing Start.

 <p>
<b>Slow Motion:</b>  First enable Level Select. While playing, you can pause the game and press A to restart, B for slow motion, and C for frame advance. 

<p>
<b>Sound Test:</b>  Enter Debug Mode, then press Up at the main menu to reveal the Sound Test option.
 
<p>
<b>Super Shortcut In The Balloon Park:</b> Go to Competition and select Balloon Park. Instead of going forward, fall down backward to land on a yellow balloon. Hold LEFT, You should walk on the ceiling. You will disappear and keep going until you win! 

<p>
<b>Auto Super Sonic #2:</b> To become Super Sonic without getting all the Chaos Emeralds, first enable the level select and debug mode. When the game begins, create a power-up box. There should be an 'S' on the box. Jump on it to grab 50 rings and become Super Sonic! 

<p>
<b>Turbo Tails !!!!! :</b> Enable Level Select, then press Down to make sure you have the sound test (don't select it yet). Start a one-player game and choose Tails in the Data Select screen. When the timer appears, press RESET.</p>

<p>Enter the Sound Test menu and choose any zone. Hold A and press Start. You should be Tails and be in debug mode. From here press B, then press A until you see a item monitor. Press C to select it, then press B to return to Tails.</p>
<p>To enable Turbo Tails, jump on the box. Tails will look weird and can not be hurt or lose any rings. He can still get squashed and drowned, though, so be careful in the Ice Cap zone. You will have do this at the beginning of each zone. Robotnik can hurt him at the very end of Launch Base zone-act 2. </p>

<p>
<b>Bonus Boards Unlimited:</b> Enter the Level Select code, then highlight the "2P Vs" option and press START. You will enter a series of bonus stages that last until you reset the system or press A+START. 

<p>
<b>Animation Madness:</b> Enter Debug Mode and press B + C. You'll be treated to a view of Sonic and Tail's moves.

<p>
<b>****NOTE**** Its unknown whether the other "special" Sonic 3 codes above will work with the Sonic And Knuckles attached. I didnt post them all here because that would be redundant. Anyway try them out and see what desired effects you get. Some may work and some may not but ONLY special ones are reproduced below. These codes can also be found on the Sonic And Knuckles page.</b>

<p><b>Debug / Construction Mode (With Sonic 3):</b> 
There are two normal ways to get debug mode without a GameShark:</p> 

<p>Method 1: Activate level select and hold A and press Start while selecting any stage. </p>

<p>Method 2: Follow the intructions for the easier method in Sonic 3. </p>
</p> 

<p><b>Super Everybody!!!!! :</b> 
Connect your Sonic & Knuckles cartridge to Sonic 3. Activate the level select and debug. When you enter debug mode, create a monitor. It will have an "S" on it. Jump on it to get 50 rings and become Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, or Super Tails! </p> 

<p>
<b>Level Select Mode:</b> First off, do the regular Sonic & Knuckles Level Select. Start Mushroom Hill or Angel Island as Sonic. For Angel Island grab run to the right and grab the first vine - For Mushroom Hill run to the right until you come to the first Pull-Up machine. (It's just after the box with the power sneakers and the Madmole.) Hang from it and press left left left, right right right, up up up. You should hear a ring sound. Pause the game and press A to reset to the title screen. Now hold A and press start for level select. Once that is done, hold UP + A, then put Sonic 3 in and reset the game. When you get to the Sonic 3 & Knuckles menu you'll find that Sound Test is there.</p>

Writer: Mike Gallagher <br>   
Artist: Manny Galan And Jay Oliveras 

<p><center>Summary: Inside one of the huts King Acorn is in a bad state since his rescue from the Zone Of Silence (Sonic The Hedgehog 36). Tails however, suddenly notes the resemblance between the King's crystalline state and The Chaos Emeralds! Sonic tries exposing the King to the Billionth Ring he got in "Ring of Truth" (#35) but only ends up making the king worse! Still, Rotor seems to think that more of the same should help -- only this time, they need fresh rings - And thus is the beginning of the Death Egg miniseries! Robotnik has left Snively behind while he goes off to tend to his ultime weapon, Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails arrive at the ring grotto (Super Sonic VS Hyper Knuckles), that was supposedly imploded when Sonic and Knuckles did a serious head butt...Only now the aforementioned grotto is covered by a metal dome! That's when Sonic thinks that Carl Condor who lives in the mountains to the west may know something about this development. Leaving Tails to watch in horror as the mound-like dome parts in two and a giant tube drops down from the sky and inserts itself suggestively into the grotto, sucking up all the rings along with him and half the landscape! Sonic, meanwhile, finds nothing but nothing in the western landscape... and as for Carl, he shows up as a roboticized Condorbot! Carl makes short work of Sonic and begins bearing him aloft to...The Death Egg!!! Robotnik then heads for the control room, and the camera pulls away to reveal the Death Egg in all its superhuge glory...Robotnik meanwhile has run into a small snag: It seems that in order to properly power the Death Egg, he needs one thing - A Chaos Emerald, and his first stop is none other than The Floating Island!!! Tails, meanwhile has climbed out of the debris and into a disabled Swatbot that Robotnik punched out last issue as he makes his way to Robotnik's control room...As for Sonic, after narrowly escaping Condorbot, using his figure-eight move we cut to Knothole as Sally learns from Nicole that the King's condition is unknown and worsening. Rotor informs Sally that Sonic and Tails haven't reported back, and has Sally let the stress get to her. Knuckles and the Chaotix are getting suspicious as the Death Egg makes a beeline for the island - and even worse is when Robotnik then launches two large "Burrobots" with one mission - Find The Chaos Emeralds. And last but not least, Sonic is readying to trash a Swatbot...the same swatbot with Tails inside....And by the end we have Robotnik steadily trying to push The Floating Island into the sea attempting to overcome the power of the Chaos Emerald!</p></center>

Knux isn't available in these two games - BUT GET THIS remember the special stages in Sonic 3? Well it seems that Sonic Team added a little secret - when certain codes are programmed into Sonic and Knux when attached to these two games you get a SLEW of special stages - in count there are possibly over 32,000 bonus rounds available for play seeing as how they take up little space to program!!!! To play the bonus rounds at any time, insert any game into your Sonic & Knuckles cartridge along with said cartridge - Sonic 1 or Sonic Spinball. (***NOTE*** - Only one bonus game is available with Sonic Spinball but its a doozy!!!!!!! ) When the "No Way" message appears, hold A + B + C and press Start. If you do this with the original Sonic game you can play the levels in order and will be given a password to save your progress. And heres one thing - they get harder and harder and harder the further you go - I specifically remember one where you have to do nearly 95% of the board backwards!!!!

Note: In case you're wondering, I've left out the passwords deliberately. Like I said - there are possibly over 32,000 playable bonus levels encoded in Sonic & Knuckles. I can't possibly list them all on the page, nor is there much point to doing so since the levels are nearly identical even though they get harder and harder and harder. Thank you.

You've met Knux in Sonic 3 but what if he was in Sonic 2? Could he handle being in Sonic's shoes on what is considered one of Sonic's greatest games? Thats the premise of Sonic 2 and Knuckles as Knux takes on the levels of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 !!! </P></center>

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>
Basically there isnt much of anything different here except your piloting Knux through the levels instead of Sonic - however that doesnt mean you wont have problems. Knux can't jump near as high as Sonic so this makes it quite harder than before! MOST notably when you get to the Death Egg Zone. So for reasonably obvious purposes you can find the walkthrough of Death Egg located here and on the Sonic and Knuckles page.</P></center>

This is the ONLY way to beat Robotnik in his super suit using Knuckles - His jumping ability is not good AND time is NOT on your side so this is MUCH harder. Go to the 4th or 5th window from the left when the cross-hairs are on you. When he's ready to slam down, spindash to the right. He will land and try to shoot his arms at you, but they won't reach. He will fly back up, and do it again. Go back to the same place. When the cross-hairs are locked on, walk away to the right side. He will land and the top of the suit will come down. Hit him in the chest when it comes all the way down. Remember only attack Robotnik every other time he lands. After you've beaten him, sit back and watch the Death Egg explode and then the ending of Sonic 2.

This is the first zone and the easiest. This zone is basically the tutorial level. Use it to learn Knux's moves. Try spin-dashing into rocks and dead ends -- occasionally you'll find a secret area.  Note that when you get a shield, its special effects that are available to Sonic do not work for you - only its immediate effects will work! The main dangers are water, robo rhinos, and monkeys in the trees. Look all around because the special stage rings are easy to find. Be on the lookout for spikes too. At act 1's end Robotnik sends a robot that shoots fire. Its the same as with Sonic, BUT when it lowers, it unleashes the flame and three bombs as well. They land in three different sections of the screen. Don't rush. Avoid the fire and bombs and jump on top. 6 hits will kill it. At act 2's end The Eggbot shows up in a machine that shoots fireballs just like Robotnik with Sonic. HOWEVER - this time he moves a little faster and he throws 4 fireballs instead of 3! Hit it once then jump off the bridge QUICK! One fireball will destroy the bridge. Dodge the fireballs and hit him 8 times. When defeated hit the button and land in the Hydrocity Zone...

This stage is another water stage except bigger - MUCH bigger. Better be on the lookout for air bubbles. Try to stay above water. Bubble shields are very handy here and just may save your life. At the end of act 1 you have to fight a robot that spins around the sides just like a washing machine. Knux can't jump over the bot, so you're going to have to spindash up the opposite wall the bot's coming from and land back in the water. Spin dash, Jump it then and hit it when it lands on the pole. Enjoy the ride when you go for a spin but don't stay in too long or you may drown. Watch out for the walls in act 2. At the end of this act The Eggbot comes to stir up trouble. Be careful, he'll stir up the water in a whirlpool BUT unlike robotnik he will NEVER lewer himself into the water. Stay away and jump on the bombs he releases right before they go off. They'll blast you up so try to land on The Eggbot for a hit.

This zone is NOT easy and is still VEEERRRRRRYYYYYYY long - with Knux! Possibly being one of the longest stages. In the beginning stay to the left of the screen!!! Thats Knux's pathway as you wont get very far going anywhere else...Your worst enemy however will be the stage itself - Be careful, sometimes the walls will close in and spikes are not what they seem. Prepare for some fast-flying action!  New objects are the blue spinwheels
embedded into hillsides and blue tops! Use a spin dash right next to a wheel to change the landscape! On a blue top, push left or right to direct it and to move upward!  Also, certain walls can be destroyed only by ramming them with a top. At the end of act 1 you'll fight a double drill bot. As it drills in the roof, a rotating spike stump pops up on one end of the screen. You need to be on top of the stump and jump off the stump and hit the Twin Drill, but don't touch the actual drills.
Hit him when his drills are up. Dodge the staclitites and rocks and stay away when he comes down. Act 2's end is COMPLETELY different from Act One - The Eggbot comes inside of the Rocket Drill Egg-O-Matic BUT this time he pops out of the ground sending long chained spikes out after you in a triangular form! It helps if you stay on one side of the screen. Wait for the two sets of spiked chain drills to appear from the top of the room to the floor. The Rocket Drill will appear then follow the paths of the chains. Don't touch the chain but hit the Rocket Drill.</P>

This zone is reminiscent to Casino Night in Sonic 2 but with a twist. Be glad and rejoice as knux doesn't have to face ANY bosses PERIOD !!!!! There are a LOT more hidden places than in other zones, and a few more toys. Try looking for special rings in this zone! If you've been keeping up with the special stages you should be able to get enough Chaos Emeralds to catch Super Sonic early on in the game !!!!! Obstacles here include the cannon which will launch you in the direction of your choice.  Of course, we must not forget the anti-gravity pads and balloons to bounce off of.  Large, black wheels to get dizzy on, and the unforgettable rotating barrels! Basically this board is kind of a "have fun" board.</P>

If you're playing as Sonic, you'll get to see him snowboard. COLLECT AS MUCH RINGS AS POSSIBLE !!! If you're playing as Tails, well, too bad. Same as usual, plus a few sleds and lift
cups. When you find and impassable wall, either you came from the wrong side, or you need to ram it through. Remember the Marble Garden?  Find a block of ice and slide away! Also, there are some little cups with safety rails. Spin-dash into the cup to send it flying upward.  Plus, ever want to know what it
feels like to be fresh frozen?  Just watch out for gas clouds from the celings. Note: Flaming and lightning shields will be useful here -- they destroy the Star Pointer's stars and they seem to prevent you from being frozen, HOWEVER Lightning shields CAN BE LOST though you may not lose any coins in the process. Be VERY careful when underground. If your going through an endless loop there's a big rock to get on somewhere that will break through the necessary wall. Spin dash into a platform to make it move up. At act 1's end you won't have to face a boss but at act 2's end The Eggbot will return with Robotnik's freezing machine BUT this time the platform moves up and down. Hit it by getting on the stand and jumping. Dodge it's freezers. It's freezers go off in this pattern: left, up, right, up.

Watch out for the Orbinauts ESPECIALLY on this board as they are VERY annoying. At act 1's end you fight the same machine Sonic fought with the rotating spiked balls. BUT this time where there was ONE there are two!!!! You'll have to be VERY quick on your feet as you dodge the spiked balls and hit him whenever you can as much as you can. Luckily at At act 2's end you you won't have to face a boss....</p>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Deep in the Heart of Floating Island, you zip through a hilly area. Much of the plant life here is useful (Use the mushrooms to reach higher areas), but most of it is just plain aggravating. There are many routes to take here, so don't worry about having to go over half of the level to find the right way out. There are lots of walls you can walk through, so do some testing. When you have to go down a "pit", be careful. Many of those "pits" have spikes at the bottom and there are 1 or 2 REAL ones as well !!! This zone is pretty easy to navigate through and takes place DIRECTLY after the Launch Base Zone. Right at the beginning of the zone is a golden ring leading to the Chaos emerald special stage. If you've been playing with Knuckles it is here that Sonic and Knux split to go thier seperate ways ( FOR KNUX's storyline see the Sonic And Knuckles gamepage), but the terrain from there after that they cover are pretty much the same up to a point unlike earlier levels, with not many badniks to worry about - until later. If you play your game wisely, you can get up to 3 Chaos Emeralds in this first zone. Note also that you LOSE your Super Knuckles powers at this point!!!!! Your newest goal will be a newer "Super Knuckles" ala "Hyper Knuckles" !!! At the end of Act 1, one of Robotnik's minions will attack. He will cut down the trees with an ax, sending the logs flying at you. Jump them and hit him when he's low down the tree. After 8 hits, he'll explode and you've finished the act. At the end of Act 2, Robotnik will be underground in a satellite. Hit the satellite and hit him as many times as you can before he flies off. He will be floating away from you as you run and jump and duck spiked hurdles attached to the trees. Jump and duck the hurdles, if you've played past Sonic games then they should be pretty easy to avoid. Hit Robotnik when ever you get the chance. After 8 hits, he'll fly away and you can free your friends. After freeing them, Robotnik passes by in the Flying Battery Zone and you grab hold to the ship before it takes off.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Longer than The Marble Garden Zone if that tells you anything - In Robotnik's flying fortress, more powerful than Wing Fortress in Sonic 2, you must go through the area avoiding the electrical and magnetic badniks lurking around. Be careful in the areas under the ship in open sky. You must navigate across the bars at the top to get to the other platform. In this zone, Sonic and Knuckles run the exact same road through this zone, so of course it would be easier to go through this zone with Knuckles. But you don't have that choice, you must start the game with one character and go through the entire game with that character! And it DOES NOT make things easier....At the end of Act 1, there is a prisoner egg holding animals. But the egg is alive!! It will try to hit you with its spiked hands. Stand on the plunger on top and spin dash away when he tries to attack. He'll hit himself. After 6 such hits, he'll explode, the animals inside him will be freed, and you will have finished Act 1. At the end of Act 2, Robotnik attacks in a boss just like Wing Fortress Zone, except without those spinning platforms. Just avoid the laser beam and jump up and hit the laser shooter hovering at the top. Every time it shoots, the walls get closer. After a certain number of shots, the whole thing will explode and you must chase Robotnik to the top of the ship before the ground comes up and crushes you. If using Tails DO NOT FLY TO GO QUICKER !!!!!!!! You may get crushed! Once up there, Robotnik will go from side to side shooting a flame from the top of the ship. After he shoots 3 times he will bounce up and down the platform. Hit him when he's above the platform. After 8 hits he'll fly away. Be careful, when his ship explodes however as, the exploding spiked hands can still hit you!

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Mind numbingly long and mind numbingly HARDER - This IS one of the longest stages. Your worst enemy yet again will be the stage itself - This time being quicksand as well as rising sand!!!  After freeing the animals in the prison egg, Sonic or Knuckles runs out of the Flying Battery and plunges to the sandy ground of Sandopolis Zone. When you fall in the sand, jump to get out. The first act is pretty easy, and so is the end boss. It's a giant stone statue that jumps at you. Just go over to the left and stand in the quicksand. When he jumps in, you jump out of the way! The monster will sink in the quicksand and the act will be finished. Now comes the hard part, the inside of the Sandopolis ruins of Act 2. Whenever the lights are out in the ruins, ghosts will come and try to attack you. Make sure you pull all the handles you can hang onto along the way, they turn the lights back on and get rid of the ghosts for the time being. Other than the annoying ghosts, as well as the annoying sandslides and sandtraps that follow the act isn't so hard. Push the switches on the floor to open up doors ahead, but 
remember, after you push these switches COMPLETELY over, run 'till you're sure you've passed the doors up, 'cause if you don't you have to go all the way back when you get to the door's switch, & repeat the process. Knock out the plugs in the ceiling, & run to the next place you're due at, or you'll find yourself starring into Sonic's eyes when he is flattened like a "Hedgehog Pancake"! Not only that but this level is so long that it litterally guzzles time. So dont stay TOO long! Oh yeah, watch out for the skorp badniks, their tails can hit you from a long distance.At the end of the act, Robotnik will attack in a BIG statue. When his left arm is in front of him, jump on it and hit the head of the statue. It will break away, revealing Robotnik. Hit him a couple more times before the statue head comes back on. Watch out, because he will fire at you right before the head comes back. Repeat this pattern and score 8 hits to get rid of him. HOWEVER - you must do this in a set amount of time - Let him get too far and you get crushed!</P>

Be careful when walking around, some of the floors give out due to your weight. There are many dead-ends that you can pass through, using the spin dash so be on the look out. THIS LEVEL IS THE LAST AREA TO OBTAIN HYPER KNUCKLES !!!!!!! Watch out for flame throwers in the 2nd act. After defeating the statue in The Sandopolis Zone, Sonic will run to the right, through the wall, and will take a long fall into the Lava Reef zone. Knux's version of the zone isn't so different than Knuckles, BUT he does go over different ground and unlike Sonic, Knux does not have an end boss for this zone. Watch out for the lava all over the place, and get out of there FAST when there's a spiked platform coming down. At the end of the act, you'll have to deal with two long arms. They'll go to the top of the screen and shoot 3 balls each at you. Avoid them and hit them on the way down. Six hits kills them, but killing the arms aren't necessary to beating this boss. After those arms go down, a giant hand will come up. It will float around for a bit, then it will smash the ground. Be out of the way and hit it on top where the red gem is. After 6 hits it will blow up.

This zone is the final zone if you are playing as Knuckles. You must fight Mecha Sonic the same way as Sonic fought him his final time. First you'll find that darn Eggbot coming after you again. Let him catch you (He will, anyway, so why try to stop him?). When Robotnik faces Mecha-Sonic, Mecha-Sonic will attack Robotnik (naughty robot!) Right before Mecha Sonic hits Robotnik, Robotnik lets you go. Glide out of there unless you want to end up like Robotnik. Mecha-Sonic is easy to attack. Just don't try the gliding attack on him, unless you can time it perfectly. After you defeat him, It looks like he's down. But, he's not as he uses the power of the Floating Island's Master Emerald to turn himself - SUPER METAL SONIC!!!!!  And this guy is ****HARD!**** Watch out when he dive bombs at you. Jump over him. When he stands still and powers up to shoot fireballs, watch out! Jump the first one. The second one will fly over your head. Jump the third one. He'll try to shoot again, but his power has been drained. He'll come down to power up again. Jump over him because he spin dashes to the emerald. Jump at him when he's jumping onto the emerald. He'll float around in the air and shoot off small balls 8 ways. Avoid them and watch out when he dive bombs. He'll lose his energy, but he'll get it right back. He'll do it again, but lose his energy and have to go to the Master Emerald again. He'll repeat this pattern. Eight hits defeats him for good. Sit back and watch the ending.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
One of the BEST Special Stages created IMO - A 3-D Fast paced and fun but each one changes and gets harder and harder. What can look simple on the outside can end up being a pain otherwise....There are three basic objects located here - red globes, blue globes, and power rings. The object is to collect ALL blue globes but if you touch the red ones youre booted out of the stage. Collect all blue spheres and youre rewarded with a chaos emerald !!!! Collect all chaos emerals and your rewarded with Super Sonic !!!!!!!!! Collect all Super Emeralds after the game has been locked on and you get not on access to "the Doomsday Zone" but the better ending of the game! Sounds easy right? BZZZZZTTT !!! WRONG ! As the stages progress it gets harder and harder, PLUS Sonic over time gets faster and faster - not only making him harder to control but harder to get turns off as well......

This is the only bonus room accessible WITHOUT the lock on device. Basically its premise is simple as you bounce around the bumpers twisting the turner which in effect will release "gumballs" and marbles. Collect the gumballs to earn a prize such as an energy, flame, water shield or 10 rings. Black marbles do nothing but bounce you while clear marbles give you nothing.

This is one of the weirder ones. Easy when getting power rings but it definetely gets repetetive. Its a mixture of the rotating special stage from Sonic 1 and the Casino Night slot machines from Sonic 2. Dont stay on the sides too long as you'll activate the goal buttons and its just random luck otherwise.
