Its a sunny day as Sonic, Amy, and Tails are walking along the shoreline of South Island when out of nowhere comes the Eggman himself - None other than Dr. Robotnik in his Egg-O-Matic !!! And here's when he lays his ultimatum - A race against Sonic and company in the ruins of the zones where he and the blue blur first met in <i>Sonic The Hedgehog One</i>! To the victor goes several Chaos Emeralds - Emeralds can only be ascertained when reaching first place! The Eggman's turned several parts of the old zones into a raceway and he's got plans for those emeralds - and they dont include a spiny blue hedgehog! So its up to Sonic, Tails, and Amy to stop Robotnik by beating him in what will become the first annual "Chaos Grand Prix"!!!!....Sonic Drift 1 was released ONLY on Japanese shores making it near impossible to play in America without the aid of an emulator! The playable characters are Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Dr. Eggman himself - better known as Robotnik! It could be called Mario Kart with Sonic and company but with a twist. For one thing this game was released BEFORE Mario Kart so that rules it out as a carbon copy. The only obvious differences are the "special abilities" that can be used after collecting two Rings. This game is not as good as its counterpart Sonic Drift 2 but that doesn't mean its not worth a play! Not only that but you get to revisit the old zones from Sonic 1 as well - even if they are only through a race. So get yourself strapped in - Its time for a little "Sonic Drift" !!!</P>

*** NOTE *** The game is split up into 3 Chaos Grand prix modes - Green Chaos, Yellow Chaos, and Red Chaos - Green being the easiest, Yellow being the medium area, and Red being hardest. The following walkthrough is based on the Green Chaos GP mode.

This zone is practically the easiest. Basically a "getting the feel of the controls" are. Be sure to stick to a fair speed and watch out on turns. Also when doing a turn make sure you look up ahead as if you get caught too far in a turn - you'll not only slow down but if you don't get out of the way in time you may hit a sign in the road!

This zone is pretty straighforward as well but isn't as easy as the first one.  Look for monitors in the road such as turbo boosts, invincibility, and jump springs. THEY WILL HELP. Also be sure to keep a look out for poles and such that will sit closer into the road - They ARE an annoyance. This zone is best used if working with Sonic.</P>

This one's VERY fast paced. Not only that but now there are more side bard than ever - And it doesnt help even when the turns are crazy. Be careful when turning and time them just right or youll ram headfirst into a pillar. Overall take it easy but go fast enough that you can maintain a good lead.</P>

ANNOYING ANNOYING ANNOYING !!!!!!!!! This place is filled with side blocks that have a tendency to get in your way - ESPECIALLY at the sharp turns. If you can get an invincibility go for it. Not only that but try to keep yourself from getting hit.

This zone is pretty fun but it is a LOT funner than the Labyrinth Zone. Stay away from the lightposts as some of them sit in the road. Keep up a good paced speed especially on the straightaways and youll do just fine! Also be sure to take it easy on curves.

This isn't extremely hard but it isnt exactly easy either. Curves get in your way A LOT not to mention that in those curves you'll need to avoid the energy filtrators taht sit at the side of the road! Keep up a good pace but be mindful of your surroundings!
