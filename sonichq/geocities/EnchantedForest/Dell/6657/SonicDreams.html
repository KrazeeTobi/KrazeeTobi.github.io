What happens when you take the wonderous NiGHTS into Dreams and splash on a warm mug of holiday magic? You get Christmas NiGHTS!!! Immerse yourself in an unparalleled 3D flying experience. NiGHTS delivers a truly amazing virtual world of dreams - filled with unbelievable real-time effects, fantastic creatures and nightmarish monsters !!! Christmas NiGHTS is a delightful, multi-faceted, holiday sampler. And believe it or not - it is FULLY date dependent!!! During most of the year, Christmas NiGHTS is a sample of the original dreamlike masterpiece. But as Winter arrives in November, the screen comes alive with new opening and closing sequences, music, costumes, and a snow-blanketed dreamscape that you won't believe. And look for surprises on Christmas and New Year's, not to mention April Fool's! Based on the original hit game designed by Yuji Naka and the Sonic Team, "Christmas NiGHTS" takes gamers into newly transformed worlds of beautiful Christmas themes and holiday music. Game environments have been redesigned from lush gardens to landscapes of snow, glittering lights and gumdrops. Each world features a totally different look and feel from the original game, with bells replacing stars, rings becoming wreaths, and Ideya Captures are now giant decorated Christmas trees!</p>

<p>Throughout the year Christmas NiGHTS gives you a selection of presents (over 10 different ones) to choose from at the end of the game. Presents include a NiGHTS museum, a Melody box where you play the music, Karaoke, and a chance to play as Sonic the Hedgehog in a totally new bonus game!!! But BEST of all ... IT'S FREE!! You could find Christmas NiGHTS packaged with Next Generation or Ultra Game Players magazines on news stands way back in December 12th of 1996. HOWEVER you can also check your local Blockbuster store where you can rent Christmas NiGHTS for free with the paid rental of any other Sega Saturn game.
