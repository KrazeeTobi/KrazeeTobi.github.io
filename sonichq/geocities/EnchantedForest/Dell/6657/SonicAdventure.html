<p align><b>Blue is back....And this this time he's come with a vengeance! After a long streak of not being seen in the gameworld or lower par than usual Sonic games. Henceforth comes the Sonic game to top ALL Sonic games! It is the ULTIMATE ADVENTURE! Or rather - The Sonic Adventure!</p>

<p align><b>Nearly five years after the release of the last true Sonic game, Sonic & Knuckles, the stage is set for the world to see blue once more. Your pupils are likely to look just like the Dreamcast logo after seeing the blue speed demon strut his stuff on Sega's new super-console...Sonic Adventure is coming, and there is no turning back. Strap up your red sneakers and grab a couple of Rings for the road...it's going to be a FAST trip....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The seven Chaos Emeralds. Some say these powerful stones are older than time itself, but one thing is known for certain: they grant immense, unbelievable power to whomever holds them. Power that can turn a normal average everyday joe - into something far more powerful. Something....Super....Enter Dr. Ivo Robotnik, the Eggman. </p>
  
<p>The Scrap Brain, The Little Planet, The Death Egg, The Veg-O-Fortress, The Egg Labyrinth, The Silver Castle, The Panic Puppet, Carnival Island, even the mediocre Mean Bean Machine. All of his greatest plans and traps dashed to pieces by a blue hedgehog. Some of them worse than others...But one thing about the Eggman: he NEVER gives up. To do so is to admit defeat. And Robotnik will NEVER admit defeat....</p>

<p>So in the wake of his many many MANY fruitless attempts at ruling Mobius and eradicating a certain pesky hedgehog - Dr. Robotnik discovered the immense power the Chaos Emeralds while excavating to make a secret underground laboratory. It was at the excavation site that he stumbled across some ancient drawings. The long-buried illustrations revealed what he had SO LONG BEEN DENIED - the true power of the Chaos Emeralds, previously known only to civilizations that time has long since forgotten!!! The doc decides it's time he takes one more shot at these super stones, feeling he has the experience and enough lessons in the school of hard knocks to put that pain-in-the-butt hedgehog in his place. Knowing full-well he is uncapable of beating Sonic with only his natural abilities, there is only one hope for the Eggman: a weapon even more powerful than the blue blur himself - and something that JUST MAY put the Death Egg to shame. Completely aware that all of his previous mechanical creations have failed, Robotnik tries a new strategy: Perfect Chaos.</p>

<p>The Perfect Chaos, as it is called, is a liquid monster with the ability to change shape to suit any situation. The water beast feeds on the power of the Chaos Emeralds, and is constantly growing in strength. It is solely responsible for wiping out an entire civilization thousands of years ago, and it's in these ruins that Robotnik digs the living fluid up. 
With Perfect Chaos under his control, Dr. Eggman plans to use the beast to take over a large city to create the supreme home base: Eggman Land. But that's only the beginning. Utilizing his army of Badniks and his new army of Ganma robots, Robotnik's first objective is to take control of Station Square. An encounter with his old foe Sonic the Hedgehog is no less than inevitable...And what does Dr. Robotnik say?</p>

<p>"Am I crazy, or am I a genius? I've got all the technology in my hands. It's time for me to take over the world!" </p>
