Robotnik's back at it, with a full-scale global disaster planned this time! He needs workers to create the ultimate doomsday machine, known as the Death Egg. So he's back to turning innocent animals into evil robots to create this ultimate weapon for him! The Eggman's already taken control of all the factories, refineries, and cities...but the seven Chaos Emeralds remain out of his grasp....Should he manage to capture them as well, he would have Mobius under an invincible grasp, and he'd never let go. It's up to Sonic the Hedgehog, along with his fox friend Miles "Tails" Prower, to stop Robotnik and collect the Chaos Emeralds before he does! Created November 24, 1992, this game blew Sonic 1 away! Twice as many zones, the awesome 3D pipe special stage, the ability to turn into Super Sonic, and the debut of that lovable fox, Miles "Tails" Prower....This game's zones set the standards for all other sonic zones in Sonic games consisting of the Emerald Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, Aquatic Ruin Zone, Casino Night Zone, Hill Top Zone, Mystic Cave Zone, Oil Ocean Zone, Metropolis Zone, Sky Chase Zone, Wing Fortress Zone, and the introduction of the deadliest weapons to ever enter the Sonic universe....Silver Sonic And The Death Egg!!!!<p><center>

<p><b>Level Select:</b>  From the main screen, select Options. Select Sound Select and play sounds 19, 65, 9, 17, then push C. Press Start to return to the main screen, and when Sonic and Tails appear, hold A and press Start. 

<p>
<b>Construction / Debugging Mode:</b> To enter Debug Mode, play these sounds from the level select screen: 1, 9, 9, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4. Press Start and hold A. To start debugging, press B, then you can select any sprite in that level and put it on the screen. To select a different sprite, press A, and to place it on the screen, press C. Note that sprite selection is different from Zone to Zone. Also, instead of displaying the time elapsed, it displays the number of sprites currently on the screen. 

<p>
<b>Chaos Emeralds - The Easy Way:</b> Start the game as you normally would. Get a Chaos Emerald, reset the game, and start the game from the options menu. You will keep the emeralds you have gained so far each time you start from the options menu. 

<p>
<b>The Emerald Hill Shortcut:</b> To breeze through Emerald Hill 1 and 2, connect Sonic & Knuckles with Sonic 2 and play as Knuckles. Climb as high as you can and glide to the right. You'll reach the end of the level in seconds

<p>
<b>The Wing Fortress Shortcut:</b> In The Wing Fortress Zone, go as far as you can to the right without climbing. Make sure you have some rings. When you see blades blocking your way, go ahead and hit them. As soon as you are invincible, walk through them. Jump on the platforms to the right and half the level will be finished.

<p><b>Extra Lives In The Chemical Plant:</b> 

If you have Sonic & Knuckles, hook it onto Sonic 2. Play until Chemical Plant Act 1. When you get to the wall with the Spiny badnik and the warp tube on the floor. Break open the tube and go through it. When you come out you will see a Ring Box next to a tower. Climb up the tower and on the top you will find one 1-up. Glide left and you will find another 1-up. Glide to the left one more time and you will find yet one more 1-up. Since you won't want to go through the level again just glide to the right until you get to the tower you started from. Get on that first tower and glide to the right. The Act will be over and you will have 3 lives more that how much you started the act with. . </TD>

<p>
<b>Ashura The Hedgehog:</b> The Asudem Code is probably the most famous code next to Super Sonic. And the nick "Asudem" has stuck to Sonic even to this day ---- To get the green sonic you must enter the level select and debug code. Then you must choose one of the Emerald Hill Zone levels because the code only works in Emerald Hill Zone (1 or 2.) When you start the level press B, you will be a ring,then press a four times,you will be four rings in a row going up or down,you then hold c and right for about 5 seconds,then you go back to the begining, keep pressing a until your the top of a waterfall. You may not see yourself but you're there. Now do the same thing as before, hold c and right for about five seconds. Then press b and you'll be green.

<p>
<b>Super Sonic:</b> To become Super Sonic without getting all the Chaos Emeralds, first enable the level select. At the level select menu, go to the sound test item, and play sounds in this order: 4, 1, 2, 6. You should hear the music you get when you win a chaos emerald. Now select any level, get 50 rings, and jump. 

<p>
<b>Turbo Tails:</b> While in Debug Mode, create and position a "Transfer Box" monitor. When you hit it and you are Super Sonic, you lose all your powers but stay yellow. Tails looks the same but has invincibility (little stars flashing around him.)

<p>
<b>The Continue Code:</b> First enable the level select. Then, at the options screen, play these sounds in this order: 1, 1, 2, 4. Now move the highlight to the "Player Select" field of the options screen and press Start.

<p>
<b>Nightime Play:</b> To play at night, enter the Debug code, then hold C and press Start to begin a level.

<p>
<b>Shielded Tails:</b> To give Tails a sheild, enter debug mode and hit a shield. Then place a teleport box down and hit that. Now Tails has a permenant sheild. 

<p>
<b>Slow Motion:</b>  First enable Level Select. While playing, you can pause the game and use A to restart, B for slow motion, and C for frame advance. 

<p>
<b>Miles Mode:</b>  At the title screen press Up, Up, Up, Down, Down, Down, Up or Up, Up, Down, Down, Up, Up, Up, Up. A chime will sound and Tails will be called Miles or vice versa. 

<p>
<b>Double Tails:</b>  Enter the level select and debug codes, then go to the Sky Chase level. Using debug mode, create a transfer box and break it open.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is the first zone in this game and the easiest as well. Not many dangers here. The most annoying badnik to watch out for is Coconuts. His exploding Coconuts cause a lot of problems. Unlike Sonic 1, this game has 2 acts for every zone, except Metropolis zone. At the end of Act 2, you must fight Robotnik in a landrover with a drill attached to the front. Jump the drill and land on the top of the vehicle to score a hit. After 7 hits, Robotnik will come by again, but he will shoot the drill off. Jump the drill and land on him to get rid of him.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
In this zone, you're in one of Robotnik's factories. The badniks are easy to avoid, but the Mega Muck is harder. Mega Muck is a liquid that Sonic will fall in and drown within seconds. Stay away from it at all costs. The boss of this zone is pretty easy. Robotnik will suck up the Mega Muck below and try to drop it on him. Avoid him and hit him while he's sucking it up. Eight hits will kill him. 
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Another water stage. You should try to stay above the water at all times. If you stay on the platforms above, you may never have to go above the water in either act. I've done it. Watch out for the pillars that shoot arrows out of them. The Act 2 boss here is 2 pillars. Robotnik will float overhead and pound the two pillars. When he pounds a pillar an arrow will fly out and hit the other pillar. Dodge the arrow and jump on it, then jump at Robotnik. He will move to the other pillar and repeat the pattern. Hit him 8 times and he's done for.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This stage is kind of similar to Spring Yard Zone in Sonic 1. There are bumpers and springs everywhere. To play the slots, jump in the silver circles with 3 pictures above them. If you land on 3 Jackpots, you get 200 rings. Three Robotniks take away 200 rings. Press the jump button to bounce off the flippers. The only badniks here is Crawl, a small robot with a shield. To get rid of him, you must attack him from behind. In Act 2, Robotnik floats in the air in his Egg-O-Matic dropping spiked mines on you. Dodge them and the red pellets they send flying when they explode. He will also drop down and try to pick you up. Jump on the flippers and bounce up at him. Eight hits gets rid of him. 
</P>
<p><b>Hill Top Zone</p></b><p><img src="/sonichq/geocities/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="sth2hilltop.gif">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is a pretty tame zone, the aboveground part that is. The Sols, orbinauts with fireballs revolving around them, are easy to dodge. When you see a board with a badnik resting on one side, jump on it to send the badnik flying in the air. Run to the other side. he badnik will fall back down where you were, bouncing you up in the air. Underground, the badniks aren't to hard to cope with, but you have to avoid the lava that rises up. In Act 2, there are some hills above the lava. There is a pool of lava resting in between. Robotnik will come up and try to torch you with fire. Jump to the other platform and hit him when he comes back up. Eight hits gets rid of him.

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This zone is an underground area where Robotnik is searching for the legendary Chaos Emeralds. Of course, they're not here. But many of his badniks are. Spikes and fast pillars can get rid of you real fast unless you're quick to avoid them. Flasher is a bug badnik that you can't hit unless he's not flashing. Crawlton is a caterpillar badnik that will pop out of the rocks. He can be easily defeated. If you see a vine, pull on it. It usually opens up a bridge or a wall leading to another area. Some vines act like elevators, and pull you up or lower you down. In Act 2, Robotnik uses a drill machine to attack you. Watch out when he goes in the ceiling or comes out of it, for staclatites are falling out of the ceiling. When Robotnik is on the ground, watch out when his drills are in front of the machine. Hit him on top now. Stay away when the drills are on top, because he's about to go into the ceiling. Eight hits defeats him. 
</P>
<p><img src="/sonichq/geocities/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p><p><b>Oil Ocean Zone</p></b>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="sth2oilocean.gif">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Here's another one of Robotnik's factories, except this time, it's oil-ridden. If you stay in the oil too long, you'll drown. Watch out for Aquis, a badnik shaped like a sea-horse. Octus, an octopus badnik, doesn't cause much trouble. You can't do anything when you're being propelled by the steam vents, so just hang on and enjoy the ride. At the end of Act 2, Robotnik will attack much like Hill Top zone. He will come out of the oil and try to shoot you with 3 lasers. Dodge the lasers and hit him before he goes back in. A scorpion tail will then come out. Dodge it and Robotnik will come back up and repeat the pattern. Eight hits defeats him.

<p><img src="/sonichq/geocities/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>
<p><b>The Metropolis Zone</p></b>

<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="sth2metropolis.gif">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is the only zone in the game with 3 acts. There are 3 badniks to deal with in here, but only one of them causes a major problem. Asteron, a star badnik, shoots his appendages off at you. It's very difficult to dodge. At the end of Act 3, you must fight Robotnik again. He will have spheres revolving around him. Hit him to make a sphere come off and turn into a Robotnik balloon. Spin attack it to burst it. After 7 hits he will have no spheres left. He will try to shoot lasers at you. Dodge them and hit him once more to kill him off.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This zone is short and sweet, well, maybe not sweet. Tails will fly you through the air on his biplane. You can't fall off the plane unless you spin dash, so don't even try it! This zone is pretty easy nonetheless, all you have to do is take out the badniks. Only one act too. After Wing Fortress zone passes by you (isn't there a sky speed limit?), you must destroy a few more badniks before you cruise on to Wing Fortress Zone 
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Like Sky Chase, this zone only has one act. Unlike Sky Chase, this zone has a boss at the end of the act. This zone is pretty easy too. The only badnik is Clucker, a robot chicken in a tank. Watch out for the propellers and hang on to the boxes when the wind is pushing you through the air. At the end of the act, Robotnik traps you in between two laser beams. A larger laser beam fires at you from the top. Dodge it's blasts and jump on the small rotating platforms. Hit the laser beam 8 times and Robotnik will run away and hop in his ship. Jump to the right of the hole for a 1-up and fall in the hole to see him take off. You will jump on Tails plane and grab the ship for a free flight to Robotnik's base in outer space.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
In this one act stage, you must fight 2 bosses before finally defeating Robotnik. The first is "The Silver Sonic". Jump over his spin attacks when he rolls on the ground and run under them when he jumps in the air. When he stands in one corner and rolls his spines, hit him on the head. Spin dash him when he dashes at you. Eight hits will bring the Siver Sonic to a stop! Now you must fight Robotnik in his giant robot War Machine. This mech is a giant Robot-Robotnik!!! Back away when he walks forward and hit his belly when he's standing still. When he flies up in the air, get out of the way quick or you'll be crushed. If he lands in front of you, he'll shoot his hands out, so jump over them. If he lands in front of you, he'll launch 2 bombs. Get out of the way before they explode. Twelve hits and you've defeated Robotnik. Sit back and watch the ending.

<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="sth2special.gif">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Possibly one of the BEST Special Stages created - This is a great Mode 7 special stage in which you run in a 3D pipe collecting rings. You must collect a certain number of rings before you reach a certain point in the stage. If you have enough rings each of the three times, you are awarded with a Chaos Emerald at the end. The stages get progressively harder. Once you have all 7 Chaos Emeralds, get 50 rings in the middle of the regular game. Jump up in the air to become Super Sonic! You are invincible and can knock enemies out just by touching them. You also become even faster!!! Your rings run out though, so keep getting them to stay super.

You've met Knux in Sonic 3 but what if he was in Sonic 2? Could he handle being in Sonic's shoes on what is considered one of Sonic's greatest games? Thats the premise of Sonic 2 and Knuckles as Knux takes on the levels of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 !!! </P></center>

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>
Basically there isnt much of anything different here except your piloting Knux through the levels instead of Sonic - however that doesnt mean you wont have problems. Knux can't jump near as high as Sonic so this makes it quite harder than before! MOST notably when you get to the Death Egg Zone. So for reasonably obvious purposes you can find the walkthrough of Death Egg located here and on the Sonic and Knuckles page.</P></center>


<p><img src="/sonichq/geocities/EnchantedForest/Dell/7834/bluebar.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Death Egg Zone - Knuckles Only</p> 


<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is the ONLY way to beat Robotnik in his super suit using Knuckles - His jumping ability is not good AND time is NOT on your side so this is MUCH harder. Go to the 4th or 5th window from the left when the cross-hairs are on you. When he's ready to slam down, spindash to the right. He will land and try to shoot his arms at you, but they won't reach. He will fly back up, and do it again. Go back to the same place. When the cross-hairs are locked on, walk away to the right side. He will land and the top of the suit will come down. Hit him in the chest when it comes all the way down. Remember only attack Robotnik every other time he lands. After you've beaten him, sit back and watch the Death Egg explode and then the ending of Sonic 2.

<p><center><b>Game Genie Codes</b></p></center>

<p><center>Note that there are two sets of codes because two versions of the games were released. Codes 1 THRU 16 also work for Tails in a one-player game. There is only one total for Sonic's rings in a one-player game. Normally, you have to grab all seven chaos emeralds, get at least 50 rings, and jump to turn into Super Sonic (and be invincible). But by choosing from among Codes 58 thru 64 and 65 thru 69, you can reduce the number of emeralds and rings you have to get. With Code 70, you won't lose your rings with time and drop back down to regular Sonic. </p></center>

<p><center>To help you become Super Sonic on the last level, where there are normally no rings, Codes 58, 65 and 72 will do the trick--just jump. Finally, access the level select menu with Code 71.</p> </center>
