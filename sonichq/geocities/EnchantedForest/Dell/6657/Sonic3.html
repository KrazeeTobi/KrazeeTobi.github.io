Whatever happened to the Death Egg after Sonic 2? After getting knocked out of the sky along with his entire Death Egg ship, Dr. Robotnik crash-landed on a mysterious Floating Island where he quickly meets Knuckles the Echidna, last of a lost civilization and guardian of the Floating Island - as well as a giant emerald better known as the mysterious "Master Emerald". The Eggman dupes Knuckles into thinking that Sonic and Tails are the bad guys, and learns that a giant Master Emerald keeps the island afloat. If he could get this Master Emerald, there would be no need for regular chaos emeralds as he would have a new source of Death Egg fuel - Forever! And while Knuckles is doing the rounds with Sonic and Tails, the Doc should have plenty of time to repair his Death Egg, as well as search for this Master Emerald.....Even though called Sonic 3 this is the fourth installment in his series of Sega Genesis games. This game was created in February 2, 1994, "Hedgehog" Day. The zones in this game may only be 2 acts, but the acts were twice as big as the ones in Sonic 2. Therefore there was a lot more to discover in this game. Just realize that if you're locking on Sonic and Knuckles you'll be heading over ground not mentioned in here sometimes. Doctor Robotnik has returned but this time he's not alone....this time he's brought Knuckles The Echidna and rebuilt his greatest invention - The Death Egg!!! Enjoy!

<p><b><center>The Code Bank - Sonic 3 Without Lock On</center></b></p>

<p><b>Normal Level Select:</b> 
When the Sega logo comes up, just after the "Sega" theme is sung and the screen begins to turn black, quickly press: Up, Up, Down, Down, Up, Up, Up, Up to the beat of the drums. You should hear a ring chime if you did it correctly. A new Sound Test option should appear at the title screen. </p> 

<p><b>Mystery Level Select:</b> 
This code requires a Sonic 2 cartridge. Insert Sonic 2 and enter the Sonic 2 Level Select (play sounds 19, 65, 09, and 17). Return to the title screen, hold A and press Start. To transfer this to Sonic 3, hold A and carefully remove the cartridge without turning off the Genesis. Insert Sonic 3 and press Reset. Finally, release A and press Down twice at the main menu.</p> 

<p>Note: You might notice a few levels you haven't seen before, but you can't select them. Those levels were originally intended for the game, but were pulled in order to release the game on time. </p>

<p>
<b>Construction / Debugging Mode:</b> Enter the Level Select code, then press A + Start to choose your starting level. Once the action starts, press C to create an item, B to toggle between items, and A to select items. Alternatively, turn on the Genesis and press Up, Up, Down, Down, Up, Up Up before Sonic gets fully on screen.</p>

<p>If those methods don't work, try this. First you must have Sonic 2. Hook it up and put in the level select code, then put in the debug code and press START. When the screen with Sonic & Tails (Miles) pull out the game but DON'T turn it off and plug in Sonic 3. Now hold Up + A and press RESET.</p>

<p>
<b>Auto Super Sonic:</b> Input the level-select code. At the new Sound Test, play the following tracks: 1, 3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 6. You should hear a Ring chime. Select your Zone. Grab atleast 50 Rings, jump into the air, and press A, B, or C. 

<p>
<b>Changing Identities:</b> Use the debug mode cheat. Start any level that has a special stage ring. Next turn into your favorite object. As an object go to the center of a ring. Now hit B twice quickly. When you get out of the special stage you will look like that object for the rest of the level. 

<p>
<b>Battle Music In the Hydrocity Zone:</b> Just before Before you fight Robotnik in the Hydrocity Zone, act 2, the boss music will come. Keep Sonic's head under the shallow water until he is about to drown, then pop out of the water. You will hear the boss music from Sonic and Knuckles. 
<p><b>Easy Emeralds:</b> 

To gain all the chaos emeralds, enter the Level Select code, then highlight "Special Stage" and press C + Start. After receiving the emerald, press A + Start and repeat the process until you have them all.</p>

<p>Alternatively, enter the Sound Test code and play sounds 2, 4, 5, 6 in order. If you did it correctly, the Emerald sound will play.</p>

<p>
<b>Mecha Sonic And Mecha Tails:</b> Use the Debug Mode code in Launch Base act 2. Beat the game. When Sonic or Tails jumps towards you, activate Debug Mode and get out of it immediately. You will be able to use Sonic or Tails in the background for a short time, but they will look like robots. 


<p>
<b>Extra Lives At The Launch Base:</b> To do this trick you must get to the first level of the Launch Base Zone. Set off the first alarm, stop Sonic in the middle of it, and do a Spin-Dash attack. The flybots will continue to attack, and eventually their value will increase to 10,000 points! Every five flybots will gain you a life and, if you're patient enough, you can earn up to 99 lives! 


<p>
<b>900 Rings For Tails:</b> Enter Debug Mode then select a stage. Next press B, A (you must have Sonic and Tails on-screen.) When your cursor changes into a ring, paste it on Tails. Repeat this process and you can gain up to 900 rings and several 1-ups. 


<p>
<b>Random Start:</b> Enter the sound test menu choose a level. Look for a star post, touch it and hold A and press START. Then choose another level. If done correctly the title of the zone will change. Beware you might start out in a wall so use debug mode to fly out. 


<p>
<b>Nightime Play:</b> Enter the Level Select code, then press C + Start to choose your starting level. 


<p>
<b>The Missing Special Stage:</b> Access a special stage not found with Sonic and Knuckles!!!!!! For an all new bonus stage, enable Level Select, then play tune 1F. Finally, highlight stage 2 and hold A while pressing Start.

<p>
<b>Auto Super Sonic #2:</b> To become Super Sonic without getting all the Chaos Emeralds, first enable the level select and debug mode. When the game begins, create a power-up box. There should be an 'S' on the box. Jump on it to grab 50 rings and become Super Sonic! 

<p>
<b>Turbo Tails !!!!! :</b> Enable Level Select, then press Down to make sure you have the sound test (don't select it yet). Start a one-player game and choose Tails in the Data Select screen. When the timer appears, press RESET.</p>

<p>Enter the Sound Test menu and choose any zone. Hold A and press Start. You should be Tails and be in debug mode. From here press B, then press A until you see a item monitor. Press C to select it, then press B to return to Tails.</p>
<p>To enable Turbo Tails, jump on the box. Tails will look weird and can not be hurt or lose any rings. He can still get squashed and drowned, though, so be careful in the Ice Cap zone. You will have do this at the beginning of each zone. Robotnik can hurt him at the very end of Launch Base zone-act 2. </p>

<b>****NOTE**** Its unknown whether the other "special" Sonic 3 codes above will work with the Sonic And Knuckles attached. I didnt past them all here because that would be redundant. Anyway try themout and see what desired effects you get. Some may work and some may not but ONLY special ones are reproduced below. These codes can also be found on the Sonic And Knuckles page.</b>

<p><b>Debug / Construction Mode (With Sonic 3):</b> 
There are two normal ways to get debug mode without a GameShark:</p> 

<p>Method 1: Activate level select and hold A and press Start while selecting any stage. </p>

<p>Method 2: Follow the intructions for the easier method in Sonic 3. </p>
</p> 

<p><b>Super Everybody!!!!! :</b> 
Connect your Sonic & Knuckles cartridge to Sonic 3. Activate the level select and debug. When you enter debug mode, create a monitor. It will have an "S" on it. Jump on it to get 50 rings and become Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, or Super Tails! </p> 

<p>
<b>Level Select Mode:</b> First off, do the regular Sonic & Knuckles Level Select. Start Mushroom Hill or Angel Island as Sonic. For Angel Island grab run to the right and grab the first vine - For Mushroom Hill run to the right until you come to the first Pull-Up machine. (It's just after the box with the power sneakers and the Madmole.) Hang from it and press left left left, right right right, up up up. You should hear a ring sound. Pause the game and press A to reset to the title screen. Now hold A and press start for level select. Once that is done, hold UP + A, then put Sonic 3 in and reset the game. When you get to the Sonic 3 & Knuckles menu you'll find that Sound Test is there.</p>

<p><center>Summary: Inside one of the huts King Acorn is in a bad state since his rescue from the Zone Of Silence (Sonic The Hedgehog 36). Tails however, suddenly notes the resemblance between the King's crystalline state and The Chaos Emeralds! Sonic tries exposing the King to the Billionth Ring he got in "Ring of Truth" (#35) but only ends up making the king worse! Still, Rotor seems to think that more of the same should help -- only this time, they need fresh rings - And thus is the beginning of the Death Egg miniseries! Robotnik has left Snively behind while he goes off to tend to his ultime weapon, Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails arrive at the ring grotto (Super Sonic VS Hyper Knuckles), that was supposedly imploded when Sonic and Knuckles did a serious head butt...Only now the aforementioned grotto is covered by a metal dome! That's when Sonic thinks that Carl Condor who lives in the mountains to the west may know something about this development. Leaving Tails to watch in horror as the mound-like dome parts in two and a giant tube drops down from the sky and inserts itself suggestively into the grotto, sucking up all the rings along with him and half the landscape! Sonic, meanwhile, finds nothing but nothing in the western landscape... and as for Carl, he shows up as a roboticized Condorbot! Carl makes short work of Sonic and begins bearing him aloft to...The Death Egg!!! Robotnik then heads for the control room, and the camera pulls away to reveal the Death Egg in all its superhuge glory...Robotnik meanwhile has run into a small snag: It seems that in order to properly power the Death Egg, he needs one thing - A Chaos Emerald, and his first stop is none other than The Floating Island!!! Tails, meanwhile has climbed out of the debris and into a disabled Swatbot that Robotnik punched out last issue as he makes his way to Robotnik's control room...As for Sonic, after narrowly escaping Condorbot, using his figure-eight move we cut to Knothole as Sally learns from Nicole that the King's condition is unknown and worsening. Rotor informs Sally that Sonic and Tails haven't reported back, and has Sally let the stress get to her. Knuckles and the Chaotix are getting suspicious as the Death Egg makes a beeline for the island - and even worse is when Robotnik then launches two large "Burrobots" with one mission - Find The Chaos Emeralds. And last but not least, Sonic is readying to trash a Swatbot...the same swatbot with Tails inside....And by the end we have Robotnik steadily trying to push The Floating Island into the sea attempting to overcome the power of the Chaos Emerald!</p></center>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is the first zone and the easiest. This zone is basically the tutorial level. Use it to learn Sonic's moves. Try spin-dashing into rocks and dead ends -- occasionally you'll find a secret area.  When you get a shield, try using its special effect. The flame shield will allow you to make a forward-leaping attack.  Note: The lightning and flame shields will wear off when you hit water.The main dangers are water, robo rhinos, and monkeys in the trees. Look all around because the special stage rings are easy to find. Be on the lookout for spikes too. At act 1's end Robotnik sends a robot that shoots fire. Avoid the fire and jump on top. 6 hits will kill it. At act 2's end Robotnik shows up in a machine that shoots fireballs. Hit it once then jump off the bridge QUICK! One fireball will destroy the bridge. Dodge the fireballs and hit him 8 times. Free the animals from the floating tank and Knuckles will show up and hit a button sending you falling into Hydro City.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This stage is another water stage except bigger - MUCH bigger. Better be on the lookout for air bubbles. Try to stay above water. Bubble shields are very handy here and just may save your life. At the end of act 1 you have to fight a robot that spins around the sides just like a washing machine. Spin dash, Jump it then and hit it when it lands on the pole. Enjoy the ride when you go for a spin but don't stay in too long or you may drown. Watch out for the walls in act 2. At the end of this act Robotnik comes to stir up trouble. Be careful, he'll stir up the water in a whirlpool. Stay away and jump on the bombs he releases right before they go off. They'll blast you up so try to land on Robotnik for a hit.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This zone is kind of easy but its VEEERRRRRRYYYYYYY long - Possibly being one of the longest stages. Your worst enemy however will be the stage itself - Be careful, sometimes the walls will close in and spikes are not what they seem. Prepare for some fast-flying action!  New objects are the blue spinwheels
embedded into hillsides and blue tops! Use a spin dash right next to a wheel to change the landscape! On a blue top, push left or right to direct it and to move upward!  Also, certain walls can be destroyed only by ramming them with a top.Tails is a real help here to lift you to useful places. At the end of act 1 you'll fight a double drill bot. Hit him when his drills are up. Dodge the staclitites and rocks and stay away when he comes down. At act 2's end Tails will air lift you when Robotnik comesbringing destruction uponthe entire zone. Using Tails manuever yourself into a position close to robotnik - jump, hit, and fall. Tails will pick you up each time so you need not worry about dying. However, this time, this boss is harder for Tails alone. Tails has to do the same thing as Sonic did, but timing is critical as you will have to manuever yourself underneath Robotnik and hit him with your twin tails. Whomever you choose, the boss's pattern will be from right, above, below, right, I think.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This zone is reminiscent to Casino Night in Sonic 2 but with a twist. There are a LOT more hidden places than in other zones, and a few more toys. Try looking for special rings in this zone! If you've been keeping up with the special stages you should be able to get enough Chaos Emeralds to catch Super Sonic early on in the game !!!!! Obstacles here include the cannon which will launch you in the direction of your choice.  Of course, we 
must not forget the anti-gravity pads and balloons to bounce off of.  Large, black wheels to get dizzy on, and the unforgettable rotating barrels! At the end of act 1 you'll fight a robot with a spike bottom. The easiest way to kill him is to jump on his top. The spike bottom will separate and then home in on you. If you're jumping on the top of the robot it will hit itself. In act 2 you may become trapped in a room with a big spinning cylinder. Press up when it goes up, and hold down when it goes down. This one area had caused MUCH confusion among Sonic fans at one point. At act 2's end you'll face Robotnik again this time with a UFO, complete with magnetism attachments and giant ball bearing! OK, this one's a little harder. When Robotnik drops the ball, get away from it since he'll use it to focus his lightning on as well as draw you towards it. When the light show ends, park right next to the ball, and I mean right next to!  Wait for Robotnik to come down to pick up his toy, and attack, Attack, ATTACK!  If you positioned yourself right, you should hit the ship right between the lightning generators. </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
If you're playing as Sonic, you'll get to see him snowboard. COLLECT AS MUCH RINGS AS POSSIBLE !!! If you're playing as Tails, well, too bad. Same as usual, plus a few sleds and lift
cups. When you find and impassable wall, either you came from the wrong side, or you need to ram it through. Remember the Marble Garden?  Find a block of ice and slide away! Also, there are some little cups with safety rails. Spin-dash into the cup to send it flying upward.  Plus, ever want to know what it
feels like to be fresh frozen?  Just watch out for gas clouds from the celings. Note: Flaming and lightning shields will be useful here -- they destroy the Star Pointer's stars and they seem to prevent you from being frozen, HOWEVER Lightning shields CAN BE LOST though you may not lose any coins in the process. Be VERY careful when underground. If your going through an endless loop there's a big rock to get on somewhere that will break through the necessary wall. Spin dash into a platform to make it move up. At act 1's end you'll fight a robot that has a ice forcefield. Hit him underneath when he comes down and dodge it's other attacks. At act 2's end Robotnik will come with a freezing machine. Hit it by getting on the stand and jumping. Dodge it's freezers. It's freezers go off in this pattern: left, up, right, up.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is the final and hardest zone......for now. Watch out for the Orbinauts ESPECIALLY. At act 1's end you fight a machine with rotating spiked balls. Dodge the spiked balls and hit him whenever you can as much as you can. At act 2's end you must fight 3 bosses. The first is Robotnik's cannon. Get underneath the stand when the top ball fires. When the bottom ball fires get on the stand and jump at him. Then jump over the ball when it rolls back down. When defeated Jump in the Egg-o-Matic to get to the second boss which is a ship that shoots rays at you. Jump over the rays and jump on the cockpit when the star is not above it. After 8 hits the final boss appears. The Nightmare with spikes and a good grip. OK, you made it this far, but you better stay alert! This one starts by passing by you from the right then from the left.  Time your jump each time so that you hit the windshield -- not the hands below or the spikes above. Then wait for it to come down and try to make you run into the spikes. Stay behind it -- you can still get caught by the hands on its way up!  Wait until it moves off the screen then, move  Sonic or Tails to the center. It'll make another two passes, starting on either side and then from the other. Tap the jump button slightly and push in its direction, you should be able to hit it. From there, it repeats by trying to impale you. After 8 hits you've beaten the boss - If playing Sonic 3 alone you've beaten the game! But if you're playing with Sonic And Knuckles attached YOU'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN as the Death Egg crash lands upon the Floating Isle !!!!

After knocking Robotnik's recently re-launched Death Egg back outta the sky before it even left the atmosphere, the explosion sent Sonic and Tails back down onto Floating Island. They landed deep in the Mushroom Hills, while the Death Egg crash-landed on the top of Floating Island's largest volcano. Now there is no choice: Robotnik needs the Master Emerald to get his Death Egg back up and running, and Sonic knows it. Knuckles, a bit peeved with all the trouble by this point, decides it's time to stop taking names and start handing out punishments. Now it's a mad three-sided race to the Master Emerald, and there can only be one victor....Created in October 14, 1997, Sonic and Knuckles was a revolutionary game because it was the first (and only game so far) containing Lock On Technology, which gave it the ability to hook up to other games. In this case, you could plug Sonic 2 or 3 into the top of the Sonic and Knuckles cartridge to play as Knuckles in those games. It boosted Sonic 3 even farther, Knuckles traveled over new ground in some zones and now there were 14 emeralds. Because of there being 14, you could now access Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Super Tails!!!! This also marked the first time you could access Super - or as he is called by some fans Turbo Tails without the access of a code! You can also stick Sonic and Knuckles in the Genesis and play it on its own. The zones are about the same size as the ones in Sonic 3, and most of them have 2 acts. Some only have 1. Like Sonic 3, there is a boss in every act, except for Hidden Palace Zone. </P></center>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Deep in the Heart of Floating Island, you zip through a hilly area. Much of the plant life here is useful (Use the mushrooms to reach higher areas), but most of it is just plain aggravating. There are many routes to take here, so don't worry about having to go over half of the level to find the right way out. There are lots of walls you can walk through, so do some testing. When you have to go down a "pit", be careful. Many of those "pits" have spikes at the bottom and there are 1 or 2 REAL ones as well !!! This zone is pretty easy to navigate through and takes place DIRECTLY after the Launch Base Zone. Right at the beginning of the zone is a golden ring leading to the Chaos emerald special stage. If you've been playing with Knuckles it is here that Sonic and Knux split to go thier seperate ways ( FOR KNUX's storyline see the Sonic And Knuckles gamepage), but the terrain from there after that they cover are pretty much the same up to a point unlike earlier levels, with not many badniks to worry about - until later. If you play your game wisely, you can get up to 3 Chaos Emeralds in this first zone. Note also that you LOSE your Super Sonic powers at this point!!!!! Your newest goal will be a newer "Super Sonic" complete with Flickie birds and "Super Tails AKA Turbo Tails" !!! At the end of Act 1, one of Robotnik's minions will attack. He will cut down the trees with an ax, sending the logs flying at you. Jump them and hit him when he's low down the tree. After 8 hits, he'll explode and you've finished the act. At the end of Act 2, Robotnik will be underground in a satellite. Hit the satellite and hit him as many times as you can before he flies off. He will be floating away from you as you run and jump and duck spiked hurdles attached to the trees. Jump and duck the hurdles, if you've played past Sonic games then they should be pretty easy to avoid. Hit Robotnik when ever you get the chance. After 8 hits, he'll fly away and you can free your friends. After freeing them, Robotnik passes by in the Flying Battery Zone and you grab hold to the ship before it takes off.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Longer than The Marble Garden Zone if that tells you anything - In Robotnik's flying fortress, more powerful than Wing Fortress in Sonic 2, you must go through the area avoiding the electrical and magnetic badniks lurking around. Be careful in the areas under the ship in open sky. You must navigate across the bars at the top to get to the other platform. In this zone, Sonic and Knuckles run the exact same road through this zone, so of course it would be easier to go through this zone with Knuckles. But you don't have that choice, you must start the game with one character and go through the entire game with that character! And it DOES NOT make things easier....At the end of Act 1, there is a prisoner egg holding animals. But the egg is alive!! It will try to hit you with its spiked hands. Stand on the plunger on top and spin dash away when he tries to attack. He'll hit himself. After 6 such hits, he'll explode, the animals inside him will be freed, and you will have finished Act 1. At the end of Act 2, Robotnik attacks in a boss just like Wing Fortress Zone, except without those spinning platforms. Just avoid the laser beam and jump up and hit the laser shooter hovering at the top. Every time it shoots, the walls get closer. After a certain number of shots, the whole thing will explode and you must chase Robotnik to the top of the ship before the ground comes up and crushes you. If using Tails DO NOT FLY TO GO QUICKER !!!!!!!! You may get crushed! Once up there, Robotnik will go from side to side shooting a flame from the top of the ship. After he shoots 3 times he will bounce up and down the platform. Hit him when he's above the platform. After 8 hits he'll fly away. Be careful, when his ship explodes however as, the exploding spiked hands can still hit you!

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Mind numbingly long and mind numbingly HARDER - This IS one of the longest stages. Your worst enemy yet again will be the stage itself - This time being quicksand as well as rising sand!!!  After freeing the animals in the prison egg, Sonic or Knuckles runs out of the Flying Battery and plunges to the sandy ground of Sandopolis Zone. When you fall in the sand, jump to get out. The first act is pretty easy, and so is the end boss. It's a giant stone statue that jumps at you. Just go over to the left and stand in the quicksand. When he jumps in, you jump out of the way! The monster will sink in the quicksand and the act will be finished. Now comes the hard part, the inside of the Sandopolis ruins of Act 2. Whenever the lights are out in the ruins, ghosts will come and try to attack you. Make sure you pull all the handles you can hang onto along the way, they turn the lights back on and get rid of the ghosts for the time being. Other than the annoying ghosts, as well as the annoying sandslides and sandtraps that follow the act isn't so hard. Push the switches on the floor to open up doors ahead, but 
remember, after you push these switches COMPLETELY over, run 'till you're sure you've passed the doors up, 'cause if you don't you have to go all the way back when you get to the door's switch, & repeat the process. Knock out the plugs in the ceiling, & run to the next place you're due at, or you'll find yourself starring into Sonic's eyes when he is flattened like a "Hedgehog Pancake"! Not only that but this level is so long that it litterally guzzles time. So dont stay TOO long! Oh yeah, watch out for the skorp badniks, their tails can hit you from a long distance.At the end of the act, Robotnik will attack in a BIG statue. When his left arm is in front of him, jump on it and hit the head of the statue. It will break away, revealing Robotnik. Hit him a couple more times before the statue head comes back on. Watch out, because he will fire at you right before the head comes back. Repeat this pattern and score 8 hits to get rid of him. HOWEVER - you must do this in a set amountoftime - Let him get too far and you get crushed!</P>

Be careful when walking around, some of the floors give out due to your weight. There are many dead-ends that you can pass through, using the spin dash so be on the look out. THIS LEVEL IS THE LAST AREA TO OBTAIN HYPER SONIC !!!!!!! Watch out for flame throwers in the 2nd act. After defeating the statue in The Sandopolis Zone, Sonic will run to the right, through the wall, and will take a long fall into the Lava Reef zone. Sonic's version of the zone isn't so different than Knuckles, BUT he does go over different ground and unlike Knuckles, Sonic has an end boss for this zone. Watch out for the lava all over the place, and get out of there FAST when there's a spiked platform coming down. At the end of the act, you'll have to deal with two long arms. They'll go to the top of the screen and shoot 3 balls each at you. Avoid them and hit them on the way down. Six hits kills them, but killing the arms aren't necessary to beating this boss. After those arms go down, a giant hand will come up. It will float around for a bit, then it will smash the ground. Be out of the way and hit it on top where the red gem is. After 6 hits it will blow up. 

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>

At the end of Act 2, you must avoid these missiles shot out by an Assualt and Batter Blimp. The missiles are easy - Its when the screen moves that it gets frustrating. Watch out for the floors that collapse around you and be sure not to get crushed! Get as many rings as possible and try to locate a flame shield if you can. You will climb platforms and soon come to one of the hardest bosses of the game - the dread lava waterfall. 

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>

Stay on the platforms. When you reach the bottom, Robotnik will attack. He will come up in one corner, forcing the waterfall to flow his way. At the same time he'll shoot these spiked balls. Jump from platform to platform away from him and watch out for the spiked balls as they can destroy the platforms. He'll shoot 3. When you avoid the balls, they will hit his ship and damage it. After a WHOPPING 15 spiked balls have hit his ship, it will explode, the waterfall will level out, crystallize, then dry up and you will have beaten the zone.  </P>

So THATS what happened to the missing Hidden palace from Sonic 2 - except it seems to have gotten a makeover....The time has come as Sonic and Tails will have to fight Knux! Jump at him when he glides and jump over him when he spin dashes. After 6 hits, he'll run away, but he'll realize who the real bad guy is when both of you see Robotnik stealing - The Master Emerald!!!! The two of you will go to a room with an orb similar to the one above. Knux will jump on it and catapult to the Sky Sanctuary zone. Sonic will follow suit, as well as Tails if you have Sonic 3 attached.

A well-done zone, but one bad jump, & you're repeating half the level again!!! For Knux this is the last hurrah but for Sonic and Tails its just the beginning as you can see the Death Egg - now powered with the Master Emerald looking over the sky !!!!! Not only thatbut Robotnik has brought back a villian of old in the form of - MEATL SONIC !!!!!!!!!! Not seen since Sonic CD the Metal Sonic is back with a vengeance! In this zone, Sonic must fight Mecha Sonic. You'll fight him at different times during the zone; at each time after you defeat him and orb will appear that you can jump on which will send you to a different part of the zone. The first time you fight him, he'll attack in the same Egg-O-matic device Robotnik used to attack you in Green Hill zone in Sonic 1 with the checker wrecker ball attached to the bottom. Get underneath the platforms when it swings toward you and duck at the edge. It won't hit you. When it swings the other way, jump on the platform and jump at Metal Sonic's ship. 8 such hits will destroy his ship. The second time you fight him, he'll attack in the device Robotnik used in Metropolis Zone of Sonic 2. This time it will be a little easier however. The final fight with Mecha though is a toughie. He will attack you himself this time. Jump above his spin dashes and get out of the way when he jumps up and falls to the ground. Hit him while he's standing still. Eight hits defeats him for Sonic but he has hisorders to take care of another being - namely Knuckles The Echidna !!!!!! The final battle awaits Knuckles (See the Sonic And Knuckles gamepage) but Sonic and Tails must now run up a huge spyre as it crumbles beneath their feet, along with the rest of the Sky Sanctuary zone. When they reach the top of the building, they jump to the now fully launched Death Egg that Robotnik has functioning yet again.....

Congratulations - Youve reached The Death Egg !!!!!!! Prepare to die.....Sonic encounters The Death Egg zone again. But this time, it's drastically different than it was in Sonic 2. It's a heck of a lot more dangerous and riddled with badniks out to get you. When you come to a lamppost with a 3 on it, stop right before it because usually you'll get sucked into a ride in an ultra sonic wave. You can't do anything, so just sit back and enjoy the free ride. The Act 1 boss isn't too tough to beat but he can be a pain in the rear! 
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>

When you Jump up at him, do your Electric shield attack when your near the eye's opening. If you don't have an electric shield watch out for the rotating arms and plug him when he's open. Then dodge the steel ball's 
shrapnel flying at you. When all the steel balls are gone, the alarm eye comes after you itself! THIS is when it gets hard!!! Wait 'till it's on the other side of the screen. Hit it from the top, & then run to the opposite side of the 
screen & duck, 'cause this machine gives one heck of a migraine 
headache! Jump on the platforms rotating around him and hit him again. Six more hits defeats him. Be careful in act 2, the gravity reverses itself a lot here. You'll be walking on the ceiling plenty and its hard to tell where pits are as opposed to ceilings lined with spikes!!! Proceed 'till you get to the anti-gravity switches/machines. Walking on the ceiling seems 
fun at first, but you get sick of it after a while. 

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="deatheggboss1.jpg">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

The next Mid-Boss is a pain in the rear. He has a shield that circles him & you CAN NOT get past the shield. You can't hit him directly, the bumpers will shrug you off. You must use his own weapons against him. Every few seconds he'll drop a robot lined with spikes on the top. If you go in the pillars to the left or right, you'll reverse the gravity, sending the spiked robots to the ceiling or the ground with you. Try to make them hit the bumper robot on the way up. If this happened, the robot will have a hit taken off of him. Eight such hits defeats him. But heres the next catch - The Death Egg zone is PURPOSELY LONG !!!!!! BE CONSIDERATE OF TIME, People have been known to beat this board at 9:58 minutes and you die when the clock reaches 10!!!! After defeating this robot, you must fight Robotnik. 

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="deatheggboss2.jpg">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

He will attack in a machine with large hands similar to Lava Reef but daringly different!!! His first attack will be using the fingers of the machine to slam down and crush you! Watch out for the fingers when they come down. Each finger takes 3 hits. Once each finger is gone, he'll retreat, but he isn't gone for long. 

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="deatheggboss3.jpg">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

When he comes back he chases you as well as the fact that the floor is beginning to give way!!! Watch out for the flames he shoots 
out his nose! Avoid the fire and plug the nose. His upper chest will open revealing the Master Emerald, Dr. Robotnik, and a LARGE ray gun!!! Hit the ray gun as it sucks energy in - It's his only weakness - being careful to jump back as quick as possible! When he gathers up enough energy up, he'll sit there for a second before he shoots a laser beam that is brutal. Jump before the laser is shot to avoid annihilation. Remember the floor is still falling! Repeat this pattern 7 more times to defeat Robotnik in his second form. 

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD>
<IMG SRC="deatheggboss4.jpg">
</TD></TR></TABLE>

Now for form number three!!! He'll then fly off with the Master Emerald with the ground falling out beneath your feet at a much faster rate than before! Run after him and hit him 8 times being careful of the recoil when you hit. If you're playing with Tails you've beaten the game!!! But if youre playing with Sonic and you don't have all the emeralds, sit back and watch the ending. If you do, get ready for the ultimate Sonic boss in - The Doomsday Zone!!!!

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Death Egg was Tails' last zone, so if you don't have Sonic and either 7 Chaos Emeralds or all 14 Chaos and Super Emeralds, then don't expect to be here. Here you are Super or Hyper Sonic, depending on how many emeralds you got. The number of emeralds you get depends on the better ending you get though theres not much difference! The rule for this zone is that the second your ring counter hits zero, say hello to pit city. You start the zone with the 50 rings you need to become Super or Hyper Sonic, but you must grab more as you get to the Final Boss since you lose 1 ring per second as Super or Hyper Sonic. Most of the rings in the beginning of this zone are near the top, so fly along there until you get to the Final Boss. You must avoid the asteroids and try to get more rings, else wise you're in for a LONG drop! The Asteroids WILL slow you down!!! After a while, you'll come up to Robotnik's ship. The rings and rocks are gone, so make sure you stocked up on rings. Robotnik will shoot pellets at you, as well as 3 homing torpedoes. You must maneuver yourself around so that the homing torpedoes hit the small Robotnik head on the front of the ship. This IS NOT as easy as it sounds!!!!!! After 8 hits, the ship will crash and Robotnik will fly off in a smaller version of the Sonic 2 end boss - The Robo-Eggsterminator!!! The rocks and rings return, so get some more rings before you die. When you get close to Robotnik, he will fire four bombs. The bombs won't kill you but they will stall you. Dodge the bombs and hit Robotnik. Don't forget to keep collecting rings because you're still losing them. Get the clusters of 6 rings, they're the most helpful. Don't pass up the 3-ring clusters unless you have about 30 or 40 rings left. Avoid the missiles and hit the head of this robot. By now your fingers will be hurting! Do this 8 times to beat the robot and save the Master Emerald. After you've defeated him Sonic snatches the Emerald and you can sit back and enjoy the ending of Sonic & Knuckles or Sonic 3 & Knuckles whichever you're playing. Now comes the easy part. Now sit back and enjoy the ending.

One of the BEST Special Stages created IMO - A 3-D Fast paced and fun but each one changes and gets harder and harder. What can look simple on the outside can end up being a pain otherwise....There are three basic objects located here - red globes, blue globes, and power rings. The object is to collect ALL blue globes but if you touch the red ones youre booted out of the stage. Collect all blue spheres and youre rewarded with a chaos emerald !!!! Collect all chaos emerals and your rewarded with Super Sonic !!!!!!!!! Collect all Super Emeralds after the game has been locked on and you get not on access to "the Doomsday Zone" but the better ending of the game! Sounds easy right? BZZZZZTTT !!! WRONG ! As the stages progress it gets harder and harder, PLUS Sonic over time gets faster and faster - not only making him harder to control but harder to get turns off as well......
