<p><center><b>Raised in New Mobotropolis before Robotnik's coup, Sonic was an average growing boy, exception being his insane speed which he worked on improving everyday. Sonic lost his parents to the roboticiser in The Great War, and was taken in by his Uncle Chuck, whom he lived with in Knothole, until he too was roboticised. Sonic was then raised in Mobotropolis by his Uncle before Robotnik's coup. Helpless to stop any of the going ons as Robotnik took control of the populace, roboticized most of the Mobians, and took over the planet, Sonic and a few other children, including the Princess, were herded to Knothole Villiage where they could learn, grow, and adapt to situations and eventually become a freedom fighting force that could one day defeat Robotnik and free Mobius. Currently, Sonic, along with Tails, have left the Freedom Fighters temporarily to track down the whereabouts of the wizard Ixis Naugus. When Sonic collects seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Sonic. As Super Sonic, all of his natural abilities are enhanced! His speed is so incredible that he actually hovers a few feet above the ground rather than running on it. He is completely invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning). His color also changes from brilliant blue to shining yellow. However, he needs atleast fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back to normal Sonic. </P></center>

<p><center><b> Not much is known of Tails' background. Tails seemed to have been abondened as a little kid, but Sonic found him and brought him into their family of Freedom Fighters when he was 5 years old. Since then, he has grown older, now being able to go on many missions with the main group. His two tails has been of invaluable assistance to the Freedom Fighters as well. He often refers to Sally as Aunt Sally and thinks of Sonic as his big brother as well as a sort of father. Tails view Sonic as the only hero in the universe, and will always try to be exactly like him. Tails also is the Chosen One, as destinied by the Ancient Walkers, to be the greatest hero of his time. Tails is outgoing and is the kind of person who can make a friend out of anybody, except maybe Doc Robotnik. He's also committed to his cause and gets very determined to do his job when he takes part in missions, resulting in an extreme bravery. When Tails collects seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Turbo Tails. As Turbo Tails, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is also invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning), and glows a bright orange-yellow color. Four Super Flicky birds come to his aid, destroying every Badnik in sight and clearing a path for him. However, he needs atleast fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back to normal Tails.

<p><center><b> Sally was raised in the pressures and responsibilities of royalty all her life. Not knowing much of her mother, she got used to living with her father the King, until Robotnik took over. He devestated everything and then her father disappeared. Since then, Sally has been living in Knothole Villiage as the the leader of the Freedom Fighters, determined to defeat Robotnik and win back her rightful heritage as ruler of the soon to be free Mobius. Heroic, intelligent, and very wise in modern situations as well as war tactics. She's more than your normal princess as she studied immensly under the tutelage of her royal teacher, Julayla after the King vanished. She is serious about her work and is committed to her cause. However, she is annoyed by Sonic's attitude as well, but deep down inside, she knows she loves Sonic and he loves her. Neither of them will admit it though unless something really forces them to. Currently her father has been found and the person she once found herself fighting for - she has become more distant from....namely her father King Acorn!

<p><center><b> A near sentient thinking, talking handheld computer Nicole is possibly the most special Freedom Fighter on the whole team. Why? She's from the future. She is a gift to the present Princess Sally from Princess Sally's future version! It is that that in the decisive battle with Doctor Robotnik, Nicole will be destroyed. Nicole was in fact created by the future version of Rotor years after those events happened. Commanded by king Sonic and Queen Sally, Nicole was sent into the past as a gift to help the Princess. But Nicole is more than a computer she is also a valued friend to all the Freedom Fighters as she is always there for Sally to talk to personally and has even saved Sonic from the grips of death and permanent roboticisation. Always full of info she is also a bit of a jokester as she occaasionally likes to give Sonic a jolt of electricity when he uses her. As Sally put it "She is a gift to myself, from myself...A friend when I needed one the most" and without her they may never be able to see the day when Robotnik will be defeated or to fully appreciate Julaylas last words upon her death - "To thine own self be true".

It was recently discovered by Sonic and Tails that she is a relation to Rob O' The Hedge, a Robin Hood like Hedgehog that is the leader of The Krazy Kritter Freedom Fighters in the land of Mercia, who sent her away when General D'Coolette - The Underboss Highsherriff, attacked thier kingdom. Since then she has been staying with the Freedom Fighters of Knothole Villiage helping when she can to defeat Robotnik. Amy is just as outgoing as Tails is and has a serious crush on Sonic.

<p><center><b> A walrus inventor with high technical skills, Rotor is the only one who can fight Robotnik's technology with technology. Not being much of a socialite, like Sonic, Rotor keeps to what he knows: building anything he wants and fixing anything he can. Though he can program them, the one thing he can't fix are computers. Because he is a fast-learner, he continuously takes things apart to learn how to put it back together. Sonic thinks of him as slow as a lava flow, but underwater -- zoom-- like a torpedo! As a valued member of the Freedom Fighters, Rotor has exceptional skills in mechanics and electronics. He has a very fast mind and can fix complex mechanical problems with ease. He's now a member of the newly appointed city council. Having grown up next door to Sonic, they escaped together when Robotnik took over. His mom escaped with his little brother (a baby at the time) to the arctic. Rotor's father and older brother (who he hasn't seen since), was captured and supposedly roboticized. Rotor misses his family a lot and is waiting until Robotnik's defeat so he can find them and they can be a family again.

His father was a general in King Acorn's realm until he was sacked by Robotnik's mechanical forces during the coup. Antoine's mission in life is to follow in his father's footsteps, little does he know that his father serves as a Robotnik Underboss in the kingdom of Mercia. He sees himself as the one who will restore the realm for the Princess through his honor and courage. Others see Antoine as a sometimes cowardly-acting klutz. Sometimes they are both right. Somewhat jealous of Sonic, Antoine is constantly competitive with him. This has caused many a rift between the two, even though Sonic doesn't take Antoine seriously half of the time.

<p><center><b> He may be extremely loyal to the kingdom but point blank Geoffrey is a big, fat jerk. More of a jerk than Antoine ever WAS! He's tried to steal Sally away from Sonic numerous times and each time has failed. Always referring to the Freedom Fighters as "Sally's Trainees" or "Rank Amatuers" he "tags along" on trips occasionally just in case the FF's need his "expertise". Unfortunately the guy is actually good at what he does - now currently head of King Acorn's secret service. He's managed to tick off every FF from Sonic by accusing him of murder, to Antoine by accusing his father of being a traitor to the kingdom, and even to Knuckles by giving orders on his island! But the one person he shares a personal loathing for is Sonic the Hedgehog as neither of them can be around each other for less than 2 seconds without fighting! He resents this to all end and secretly wishes one day he could have him out of his hair permanently to get what he wants - Sally Acorn! And in the words of Sonic "He doesn't love her, but only loves himself".</P></center>

<p><center><b> Hershey The Cat became a Freedom Fighter late in the series but she became a welcome addition - ESPECIALLY under the circumstances. You see, it was her who almost killed Princess Sally. However she didn't know that's what she was doing. She actually thought she was doing in Snively! There's also another secret - Hershey used to date Drago Wolf, now a traitor to the kingdom, and was frequently battered by him on occasions. It was due to these batterings that she rarely stood up to people and came into the public. It was only when she realised that she was tricked by Drago into almost murdering Sally that she finally snapped and showed her stuff as well as opening up the picture of who nearly killed Sally and who framed Sonic. Due to her help in the whole fiasco she was exonerated of all charges and became almost like one of the Freedom Fighters - occasionally going on adventures with them. Currently she serves as a memeber of the Secret Service. But her dating life may still be troubled. Rumor has it that her and Geoffrey St. John may be thinking about each other on the sly, not only that but Drago has escaped from prison as well....</P></center>

<p><center><b> Charles was the Royal Engineer for the King and was given his title when he created the Roboticizer, a machine built to roboticize people's limbs lost in wars, accidents, and other tragedies. However, Warlord Julian ( Ivo Robotnik )sabotaged the machine and made it so that it completely took away a person's will and roboticized them from head to toe. Charles quit his job in anger of himself and opened up a chili dog chain raising his orphaned nephew Sonic until Robotnik fully took over. Charles was later captured and roboticized, turned into a robot devoid of control. However, thanks to Sonic, a power ring, and Charles own determimation, he broke control of his body away from Robotnik and served a spy for the Freedom Fighters. In the defeat of Doc Robotnik, Charles finally felt at peace with himself after helping clear Sonics name of murder in the supposed death of Princess Sally. He still blames himself for the roboticiser but he's not as harsh as he used to be. He also kept another secret - To keep Robotnik from finding them, after Chuck regained his memory, his next step was to hide away Sonic's parents so Robotnik couldn't dismantle them. When Sonic found out he bacame extremely angry but over time it ended up bringing them closer together....Charles is nice to everybody and tries not to let anybody down. He belives the whole roboticizer ordeal is all his fault, but the Freedom Fighters help him to see otherwise. Overall, he's "way past cool".

<p><center><b> The past of Jules The Hedgehog is a mystery to his son Sonic. Married to Bernie Hedgehog the two gave birth to a boy that would soon become one of the greatest heroes on Mobius. But according to some people his father was a bit of a hero himself as he used to posses the same powers granted to his son Sonic. Serving as a soldier in the kings army Jules and Bernie mysteriously vanished around the time of Robotniks takeover - thus leaving Sonic an orphan. The truth was that Jules was actually the first person on Mobius ever to be roboticised! The Great War had left Jules and Bernie severley wounded and as a way of trying to heal them Charles, his brother and Sonics uncle, roboticised them to help heal thier wounds. However because the roboticiser cannot deroboticise due to any maintenence upkeep the chance never came to deroboticise them. Chuck, out of his own guilt, soon took in Sonic to raise him in his parents abscence but was roboticised in the Robotnik takeover truly leaving Sonic an orphan and without any knowledge of what happened to his parents or his uncle. It wasn't until years later that Sonic had discovered his uncle and with the help of a power ring helped him regain his free will. But there was one problem - Charles remembered Sonics parents! Setting out to find them Charles took them helped them get back thier free will and hid them away from Robotnik (to keep him from dismantling them) and Sonic (to keep Robotnik from ever using Sonics emotions against him). It wasnt until after Sonic defeated Robotnik that he found out about Jules and Bernie and currently is trying to form a relationship with the two people he once thought dead - his mother and father.</P></center>

<p><center><b> It all began the night of Julayla's death. Julayla was the personal advisor to Queen Acorn and also served as nanny to the local children and royal family including Sonic, Antoine, Rotor, Sally, Bunnie and after his discovery - Tails. During the great Robotnik coup it was around the time that King Acorn gave the orders for Julayla and Rosie to be herded to Knothole Village for sanctuary - he wasn't again seen for ten years after that day....Assuming the worst, Julayla began to train Sonic and Sally and the kids - much to Rosie's exasperation - to become the group that they are today. Serving as Sally's mentor and giving advice when needed it was Julayla and Rosie that raised Sonic, Sally, Antoine and Rotor while Sonic "raised" Tails after the disspaearance of all thier parents and relatives. At the time none of them knew of the roboticiser and other such tools. Somewhere along the line Bunnie dissapeared only to show up again years later. And then around the time that Sonic and Sally turned 15 - Julayla died. Leaving Rosie and Sally in charge, Julayla left all she owned to Sally which led to the discovery of the hope chest that began the true adventures of FF's. Now for Rosie - On an interesting note, Time was also altered ( "Blast To The Past" ) as it was said that Rosie was captured and roboticised when they were children. Sonic and Sally went back in time and in effect prevented that whole ordeal from ever happening which shows why Rosie is not roboticised today, resulting to the timeline shift shown above. Rosie now serves as personal advisor to the Freedom Fighters in the wake of Julaylas death. And though she is definetely no Julayla she certainly can handle her own as she looks out for "her children".</P></center>

<p><center><b> King Acorn has led a life of tough decisions and harsh realities. It began around the Great War when he thought he lost his wife after an Overlander attack on the kingdom. After that came the Great Robotnik coup that would change his life forever as he ended up being banished to The Zone Of Silence for 10 years by Warlord Julian A.K.A. Doctor Ivo Robotnik !!! While there he also met with another old foe to the kingdom - Ixis Naugus, the mad wizard and creator of the zone Acorn had to spend his next ten years in! The effects of The Zone Of Silence are known to drive those in it to madness and the only way King Acorn could survive was by pledging fealty - and his kingdom - to Naugus with little or no hope of stopping Robotnik or ever escaping. Over time somewhere along the line the king lost total memory, and when Sonic and Sally came to rescue him they had no idea of what thier effects could cause. Prolonged exposure to the Zone Of Silence also brought along rapid crystallization to the body - Full crystallization meant instant death. Sonic, Sally, and Rotor managed to stop the process in time but for quite a while the king lay in a coma until Sonic probed his mind courtesy of Doctor Quack's Dream Watcher. The king is now fully uncrystallized thanks to the help of the magical Crown and Sword Of Acorns, but he has yet to realise that he is slowly distancing himself from theone person who fought so hard tosave him - his daughter Sally.

<p><center><b> Rob O' The Hedge comes from the area of the planet known as Mercia where he was the leader of The Krazy Kritter Freedom Fighters....until they were roboticised. It was in his country where Robotnik sent his underboss - General D'Coolette ( there known as The Highsheriff ). Like all the other underbosses The Highsherriff began his reign of terror by roboticising the public and forcing others into hiding in Deerwood Forest much like the Freedom Fighters of today. Setting up the rebellion in Mercia, Rob began to fight the good fight to keep his country from falling under the sway of The Highsheriff. Fearing the life of his cousin - Amy Rose - he sent her away to Knothole Village where he hoped that she would be able to avoid the war and its harsh effects....It wasnt until years later that Sonic and Knuckles discovered Rob. Though Robotnik had been defeated at the time, The Highsheriff still held sway in Mercia. Knuckles at the time - helping out The Forgotten Tribe and Sonic on the trail of Ixis Naugus agreed to help him in liberating his kingdom. By this time his entire Freedom Fighter group had been roboticised and he was the only one left along the last few people there. It was also by him that Sonic found out more info on Amy Rose seeing as how little to none knew of her past as well as learning another secret - The Highsherriff was Antione's father! Once thought a casualty to the war in truth he had been roboticised and lost of all free will! It was at this time that Rob met Mari-An - one of the members of the Lost tribe and they fell in love. After Sonic and Knux helped him destroy The Highsherriff's castle, Rob aided Knux in finding the lost city of Albion at Journey's End, as Mari-An decided to stay with the man she had fallen in love with....Currently the two are in Mercia cleaning up what is left of the castle and trying to figure out a way to deroboticise the Mercian FF's...</P></center>
