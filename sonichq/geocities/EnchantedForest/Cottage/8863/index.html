<p><center> This is the Sonic cartoon widely regarded by many as THE WORST of the Double Sonic Cartoons. This is the cartoon that the long running Archie comic book USED TO BE modeled on until readers began to protest. Featuring Sonic, Tails, Doctor Robotnik, Scratch, And Grounder it was produced by DiC animation in the early 90's also and killed itself due to sloppy animation and storylines. Many of the jokes were usually lame, a shame because this could have had the potential for an EXCELLENT cartoon. In fact because it came out at the same time as the SatAm cartoon it could be blamed for the demise of it. Below is a list of all of the 65 episodes (In order of showing) plus the additional Christmas Special along with a brief synopsis of each episode.</center></p>

hoard of diamonds, guarded by a miserly mole. Deciding they`re after
his treasure, he imprisons them, but they are forced to join forces
when the robots threaten to blow up the mine, and the mole sees the

right into her trap, but she has a sudden pang of guilt at his
sincerity, and saves him at the last minute leaving

Grounder, who use them to lure Sonic into the path of their new slow
motion ray. Sonic is then captured, but saved by Tails when he reverses
the effects of the ray and turns it on the sloths, turning them into a
high speed fighting force, before turning it on Sonic! One of the
better episodes for Tails fans, but the sloths` drawl sets your teeth
on edge within thirty seconds. </TD>

But, when they meet "Da Bears", a case of mistaken identity starts. "DaBears" think Scratch and Grounder are Sonic and Tails and are helping
Scratch And Grounder to guard a train full of missiles against the real heroes` attack!
! The first appearance of `Da Bears` (see `Mad
Mike, Da Bear Warrior`), a pair of dim-witted bikers.

After trying to get him into the army unsuccesfully tails notices a billboard which asks about a family and thier search for thier missing son - A TWO TAILED FOX ! One problem though - It's really Scratch and Grounder in a Doc Robotnik plot to kidnap Tails! Sonic takes him to the home and it's a sad good bye (well, notreally) as Sonic remembers that he gave him the name Tails and his family would have called him Miles. And its this error of judgement that Sonic sees the trap as he goes off to rescue his friend! One of the more tolerable episodes, with Tails` history as a redeeming feature.</TD></TR>

		<TD><A NAME="play">Sonic rescues old, out of shape, Captain Rescue. But at the end,it's
the other way around...Sonic`s freedom fighting efforts are suddenly
hampered by an incompetent veteran superhero with a lust for glory -
Captain Invincible. When Sonic rejects his attempts to `help`, he is
fooled by Robotnik into capturing Sonic, and too afraid of his own
incompetence to attempt a rescue, but Tails convinces him to save the
day. Another episode with the sentimentality laid on with a trowel.</TD>

him in fighting against Sonic! When she is finally brought back to
normal, Sonic arranges for her to meet her real hero. Bland, rather

		<TD> <A NAME="wisker">It MAY have been possible that this was PARTIALLY adapted in <i><b>Sonic The Hedgehog #9</i></b> but I'm not sure....Robotnik constructs a (frankly unconvincing) robot replica of Sonic, and instructs a young mouse to pilot it and ruin the hedgehog`s reputation on pain of his parent`s lives....The mouse comes to Sonic for help, but Sonic falls ill before they can reach Robotnik. Tails takes the suit in an attempt to be a hero, but is captured, and Sonic recovers in time to save the day. The plot is... to be polite, formulaic, and the animation is even <b>WORSE</b> than usual.</TD>

stolen by Hacker the mole, and finds its way into Grounder`s brain by
mistake! Grounder takes over as supreme villain, and even succeeds in
capturing Sonic; but he`s saved by Tails and Hacker, and Grounder is
defeated by Scratch`s stupidity. Another of the all too few redeeming
episodes for Tails fans, and patronising to computer users, as well! Debateably one of the best episodes in the season.</TD>

		<TD><A NAME="music">A decent episode with a lame ending. Dr. Robotnik has invented The Ultra-Freezomatic with his goal to freeze every being on Mobius and place on them little cigarette-patch looking "Servitude Chips" thus giving them complete obedience to Robotnik. But when he installs them in Scratch and Grounder with the program of "Get Sonic!" they end up prematurely setting off the Freezomatic instead. Thus in the ensuing chaos and messed up circuitry Scratch and Grounder fluctuate between Sonic and Robotnik being their master. And even worse still Tails is captured and a servitude patch placed on him.</TD>

		<TD><A NAME="split_up">This was one of the few stories to have a plot based on the game. Robotnik wants the Power Gems from the city of Submerbia in the Labyrinth Zone. And he kidnapps the Princess Bubbles in order to do it! Little does he know of the love between Bubbles and her estranged merman boyfriend - who after being rebuked by the King goes to Sonic for help. The horrible surfer dude accent on the boyfriend did nothing to help an already weak plot.</TD>

		<TD><A NAME="music">When the robots rip open a door to an alternate
dimension, a mysterious small purple alien blob creature from
another dimension falls through into Tails hands and Sonic lets him keep it. Simple? WRONG! The one problem is, the alien will only eat ... guess ... yep, Chilli dogs!!!!! And if it doesnt get them it
grows to a huge alien, goes ballistic and sucks everything up in site. The alien - now named Goopster, is in constant danger as the robots would
find it more use as a weapon, and areconstantly try to capture it. Doc Robotnik s tepsin, kidnaps it and Sonic and Tails must go to rescue it! But things get really haywire when Robotnik angers the alien and it sucks up Sonic and Tails!!!!!! The
heroes eventually trick the robots into sending it home to its parents.
A one joke show.</TD>

But in an attempt to reprogram his brain an explosion occurs in the lightning storm causing his reprogramming to go bonkers. And so his mind begins to switch programming from lost memory, to regular memory, to Robotnik created memory and the only true mind reviver being none other than chili. Plot sound familiar, it should. Look at "Sno Problem".</TD>

The minor you ask - TAILS !!!! The courts forcibly place him under her care, and she imprisons him in her fortress, using Tails, locked in her torture chamber, to keep him there!! Viewers will wish she`d stayed in the asylum.</TD>

into space whilst trying to prevent Robotnik from launching a deadly rocket towards a space station! When they arrive, they find the space station inhabited by a very hungry - and cold afflicted - alien, who views them as the first fresh meat for some time, but they bargain with the alien that it can chase Robotnik for as long as it wants, if it will help them return to Mobius! The sneezing alien is the only joke,
and it doesn`t work.</TD>

		<TD><A NAME="good_bad"> Mad Mike (last seen in `The Robotnik Express`), receives a blow to the head and suffers amnesia, which causes him to think that he is loyal to Robotnik! Sonic, Tails and Big Griz must change his mind. The plot and the jokes have been used before, and of ALL the characters used they had to bring back "Da Bears"! SHEESH !!!</TD>
		
	</TR>
<TR>		<TD>35</TD>
		<TD><STRONG> <center> "The Last Resort"</STRONG></TD>
		<TD><A NAME="split_up">When Robotnik announces his intention to give up villainy, Sonic is therefore forced into retirement, and the offer of an all expenses paid adventure holiday from a town`s grateful mayor seems like just a thing to relieve his and Tails` boredom. But -shock! horror! - the mayor was really a robot, and the entire island is populated by the duplicitous Robotnik`s troops, hellbent upon bringing
about the heroes` demise. Perhaps mercifully, this is completely bland...</TD>

<TR>		<TD>36</TD>
		<TD><STRONG><center>  "Robotnik's Rival"</STRONG></TD>
		<TD><A NAME="moondreams">A half man, half duck (yes, really) named Quark suddenly appears with his robot servant in tow, and attempts to oust Robotnik from the villainy stakes. The two attempt to co-operate and defeat Sonic, but rivalry and sheer stupidity mean that they fail and the newcomer is sent back to from whence he came. A very weak plot with
no redeeming animation quality, and the inclusion of an outside villain has its usual lack of success. Just reading this should make you weep in despair.</TD>

the Mobius mint before it can release a Sonic banknote, with the
ultimate aim of forcing it to produce currency in his own image.</TD>

Whilst they travel to the professor`s laboratory, the professor is captured and replaced by Robotnik, who gets the unwitting fox to help him to build his new anti-Sonic weapon! All is saved when Sonic accidentally shows up. The professor is as infuriating as ever adding his usual amount of lameness to what could have been a decent episode.</TD>

And just when it looks as if this could be one of THE BEST EPISODES all goes downhill - Then, the superhero suddenly realized that Robotnik had tricked him and his show wasn't on TV at all. He
rescued Sonic from the ball (but wait, wouldn't he have to go close to it? Why didn't it leak water?) and Sonic saved his friends by bailing water out with his Hero of the Year trophy.  Next stop - A surprise visit to Doc Robotnik!</TD>

		<TD> <A NAME="secret scroll"> Robotnik captures a master of martial arts (Miyagi by any other name), and steals his knowledge in order to turn Scratch and Grounder into better fighters. The master`s pupil comes to Sonic and Tails for help, and the trio then battle the robots for the sensei`s
freedom. Even more badly animated that usual..</TD>

		<TD> <A NAME="rules_game">How ironic that the LAST EPISODE is the best of the season. Christmas Blast is a Christmas Special that first aired on USA Network on November 24, 1996 at 12:30 PM/11:30 C. Based around "The Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog" (Weekday T.V. Show) elements such as Princess Sally were added from "Sonic The Hedgehog" (Weekend T.V. Show). DiC basically merged the two shows to create something like the Archie Sonic Comic Book when it first started.
Dr. Robotnik (posing as Robotnik Claus), takes Santa's place as an evil scheme to have people give him presents, instead of the other way around. Sonic and Tails are searching for a present for Princess Sally (Who is Pink and says nothing the whole episode) when they learn that Robotnik Claus has stolen every gift on the planet. Sonic and Tails go searching for the real Santa, who is locked away 7 miles south of the North Pole. Eventually finding him Santa points out a Special Ring that Sonic is wearing (that Sally gave Sonic the year before). that will give Sonic Super Speed if he passes a few tests. Can he pass these and save Christmas?.</TD>
