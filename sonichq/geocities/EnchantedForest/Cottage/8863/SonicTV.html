This series created by DiC was on ABC Saturday mornings for two seasons, 1993-95. It was also in reruns on the USA cable network until recently. I have compiled summaries, pics, and other various tidbits from this series - The absolute BEST of the Sonic toons!<P>

Sonic returns to his origins, as 2 cartoon episodes of Sonic were made in Japan. They're VERY hard to find, but there is one man who knows all about the Anime: Alessandro Sanasi. Credit goes to him for giving all us Sonic fans a look at this classic.<P>
