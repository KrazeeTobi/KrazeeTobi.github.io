The Saturday AM version of the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon series introduced the Freedom Fighters to the world, and many consider it the better of the two series. It was a great cartoon, 
but the fact that it was constantly up against Power Rangers led to its cancellation on a cliffhanger, and most recently, USA stopped showing reruns of this show. Thus, it's hard to find if you've never seen it, so let me get you familiar.<P>
