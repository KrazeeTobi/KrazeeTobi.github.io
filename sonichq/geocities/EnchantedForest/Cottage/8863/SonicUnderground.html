<CENTER>The bands ready to play - But it seems Knuckles, Tails, and Amy may want to renegotiate the contract deal....</center>

<p><center>"DiC has recently been working on a new Sonic series for the upcoming Fall." THAT's what we were told at the beginning of last falls season.....Reason to rejoice yes? Not quite....After Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgheog all we had left were reruns of the Saturday Morning Sonic by far the best for the three and the basis of the comic. But fans were mortified to learn that this new series will be a totally different spin from what the previous series were....</p></center></font>

<h3><font color="#8000e0"><p><center>"Here we will present some info and current news about the series due to premiere in March or September of 99. With the revival of Ghostbusters under the title "Extreme Ghostbusters" it was bound to happen. DiC Animation has been reviving its BEST cartoons and new to the flock is Sonic Underground"!</p>

<p>Special thanks to Allesandro Sanasi for providing Sonic fans with this new info !!!</p></font>

<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"> <p>Currently in the making, the first season will have 40 episodes with animation
done by either DiC France or DiC China. The show is supposed to be a mix between the syndicated and the SatAM cartoon (oh my.....) But it will be a completely new setup, with NO references to the original SatAM cartoon. This means no Sally, no Bunnie, no Rotor, no Antoine, no Dulcy, no Scratch, no Grounder, and most mortifyingly - SUPPOSEDLY not even Tails! Apart from Sonic and Robotnik, no other of the established SEGA characters seem to be in. It will most likely be shown on UPN or FOX. In the new episodes, Sonic will have a brother named Manic and a sister named Sonia, and together they form a music band they call "Sonic Underground". And while they travel from town to town in disguise, give concerts to raise the spirits of the oppressed Mobians' and help people in need, they are also searching for their mother, Queen Aleena Hedgehog, who is the rightful ruler of Mobius. But Aleena is constantly pursued by SWATbots, because Sheriff Robotnik wants to force her to marry him so he will become Rightful King - BUT....It seems things aren't quite as good as things the show will be premiering later than expected.....</p>

<p>Alas,
SEGA still keeps most of it under wraps, but I'll give you an overview
of the info that has already leaked out... and more.  Since everything
is still <i>unofficial</i>, of course the final version may differ from
what we tell you here.<P></h3></font>

<blockquote>


<font color="33cc66"> <font size="4"><i> The Great Legend </i></font>

<p>"One future day, the planet Mobius will be ruled in peace
by the Council of Four - Queen Aleena and her three children.  Sheriff
Robotnik will be defeated, and freedom will be won for all citizens."</p>

<p>When Robotnik learned that the Queen had given birth to triplets, he ordered
his SWATbots to capture them, so the prophecy could never be fulfilled.
But the Queen sent her children into hiding in different parts of the
planet, while she herself left her home and from then on wandered around
Mobius.

<p>

Years later, when Sonic had already become a Freedom Fighter, he learned
about his siblings, and from then on didn't rest until he had found them.</p>

<font color="ffffff"> <font size="4"><i> The Band </i></font>


<p>

The band "Sonic Underground" is formed by three members.  Sonic, who plays
a guitar, his brother Manic, who plays the drums, and their sister Sonia,
who plays the keyboard.

<p>

Together they travel around Mobius, always in hope to one day find their
mother, while constantly pursued by Robotnik's forces.  Whereever they go,
they try to help the troubled citizens they meet on their quest, and with
their music they spread the spirit of freedom in the minds of the oppressed
Mobians.

<font color="33cc66"> <font size="4"><i> The Characters</i></font>

<h3> Sonic </h3>

Sonic is the usual high-speed hero with fast moves and cool talking.  He
only fears water, since he can't swim.  His instrument is the guitar.

<h3> Sonia </h3>

Used to take care of herself before she joined the band, Sonia is quite an
independent character, and almost as eager to join any action that comes
her way as Sonic is.  Her instrument is a portable keyboard synthesizer.

<h3> Manic </h3>

Manic looks a lot like a buzzcut blond-wigged version of Sonic, wearing
black shades.  Manic often has his head in the clouds and is sometimes so
caught by his own beat that he forgets what happens around him, which can
bring him into dangerous situations from which Sonic and Sonia then have
to rescue him.  His instrument are a set of drums.

<h3> Robotnik </h3>

As always, Robotnik is the ultimate villain of the series, this time with
the difference that he has given himself the title "Sheriff".  To finally
become Rightful Ruler of Mobius, he is obsessed by the idea to find Queen
Aleena and marry her.

<h3> Sleet and Dingo </h3>

Sleet and Dingo are two Bounty Hunters working for Robotnik (a wolf and
a jackal).  Both are experts in camouflage, and have the ability to morph
into any object they want, although there will still be some characteristic
of their usual appearence (think "Little Wizards", if anyone remembers that
cartoon).

<font color="ffffff"> <font size="4"><i> The Rumours </i></font>

<p>

So far, it hasn't been revealed when or on which channels the new "Sonic
Underground" cartoon series will be aired, but according to rumors it
will start in September.  It is also said that one of the first stations
to carry it is the <a href="http://www.foxnetwork.com">FOX Network</a>.

<p>

There is also a rumor that <font color="#8000e0">Knuckles</font> will
