<H2>Sonic Episode Guide - Season 2</H2>
</CENTER>

Here is the complete 13 episode guide to the 2nd season of the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series. All episodes are rated by me on a 5 star scale. Episodes are in order. All episodes were written by Pat Allee &/or Ben Hurst (with the exception of "Fed Up with Antoine", written by Len Janson).
<P>
<H3>2nd SEASON - 1994-1995</H3><BR>
<B>Game Guy (** 1/2)</B><P>
A ram named Ari is being chased by SWATbots. Tails & Dulcy spot him 
and tell Sonic & Sally, who use a super magnet they found in a rundown 
hover unit to make the save. Later, Ari explains that Robotnik is 
holding his fellow Freedom Fighters in an old fortress. Sally gets 
suspicious at this, but Sonic trusts Ari, and is willing to help. 
Meanwhile, the others find out the SWATbots' orders: Pursue Ari, but 
do not capture, lure to the fortress. Elsewhere, Sonic brings Ari to 
the fortress, where Ari sets the trap before Sally & Dulcy can warn 
Sonic. Robotnik then reveals his trap to Sonic: a pinball game, with 
Sonic as the ball, and a portal to the Void as the end of ball 
penalty. In Robotropolis, Ari arrives, demanding Robotnik to release 
his Freedom Fighters since he trapped Sonic for him. Robotnik shows 
that he broke the deal and roboticized them instead. Sally & Dulcy 
break in to make the save, then head to save Sonic. Ari steps ahead to 
rescue Sonic, when Robotnik sets the game to suck itself into the 
Void.  Ari gets sucked in, but manages to tell Sonic about King 
Acorn's list of other Freedom Fighters before he disappears.<P>
A decent episode, and sets the first tone for the climax at the end of 
the season.  Also introduced the Void, which would also appear later 
in the series.
<P><BR>
<B>Sonic Conversion (*****)</B><P>
Robotnik tests his new VR ShriekBot on Sonic & Sally, but Sonic proves 
that it's not as fast as Robotnik thought. The two return to Knothole, 
where they test the deroboticizer on Bunnie. The test proves 
successful, and Sonic decides to go after Uncle Chuck. He restores 
Uncle Chuck's will with a power ring, but the derobotcizer 
malfunctions. Sonic then goes to Robotropolis to steal the main 
components from the roboticizer. Back in Knothole, the second try on 
Uncle Chuck succeeds. The victory is short-lived, as Bunnie suddenly 
reverts back to part-robot, and Uncle Chuck turns back into a robot & 
captures Antoine & Tails. Sonic follows, only to be caught in 
megamuck. Dulcy, Sally & Bunnie help him out, and Sonic heads for 
Robotropolis. He finds Uncle Chuck there, and helps him fight to 
regain his free will. Uncle Chuck then decides that he'll stay in 
Robotropolis as a spy. Sonic then proceeds to outsmart Robotnik's 
pumped-up VR Bot and escape with the others.<P>
Dan Drazen called this the breakthrough episode of the series. This is 
an incredible truth. The ultimate tug on your's and the Freedom 
Fighters' emotions. Sonic's state of sadness at the end of the episode 
is especially powerful, and again without complaint from Sega. If 
you've never seen any ep of the series before, I suggest this as your 
first.
<P><BR>
<B>No Brainer (**)</B><P>
A routine mission in Robotropolis is called off by Uncle Chuck. Sonic 
stays behind & makes a rescue. During the escape, Sonic is zapped with 
a ray that makes Sonic loses his memory. Snively finds him and 
convinces him that the two are friends and that the Freedom Fighters 
are the enemy. Snively tells Sonic to find Knothole & send the 
coordinates. Once that's done, Snively invades to round up the Freedom 
Fighters. The others, however, manage to save Sonic from his memory 
loss with a power ring. Sonic makes the save and turns the memory ray 
on Snively. They send him back to Robotropolis & adjust the computers 
to put Knothole's location in the Great Swamp.<P>
An off episode, one that was better handled in Sonic comics#27 & 28. 
Still, seeing Snively pester Robotnik at the end of the episode was a 
humoristic touch that was worth it.
<P><BR>
<B>Blast to the Past - Part 1 (****)</B><P>
Sally begins to get frustrated over failed missions, and Sonic wishes 
they could've stopped Robotnik before he took over. Dulcy suggests 
that they go to the Floating Island (different from the one we all 
know) to use the Time Stones to go back in time. The group heads there 
& passes a series of tests to earn the stones. Sonic & Sally travel 
back to the day of the takeover. There, they meet their 5-year old 
selves, and learn from Uncle Chuck that he was the inventor of the 
Roboticizer, but Julian (Robotnik) stole the plans. The three try to 
warn King Acorn of the coup, but convince him too late. Robotnik 
attacks, kidnapping the children & storming the palace. To be 
continued.<P>
This was the first time that the details of Robotnik's coup was looked 
into. Powerful emotions displyed by Sally, the humor of Sonic racing 
his younger self, and the entire adventure to this point is incredible. 
This all made for one of the more popular episodes. And it's only Part 
1.
<P><BR>
<B>Blast to the Past - Part 2 (****)</B><P>
Continuing from Part 1, Sonic escapes with Sally under insistence from 
Uncle Chuck. However, they're captured. Robotnik then changes the city 
to its present state. Sonic & Sally go to escape and rescue the kids, 
shutting down the roboticizer before Bunnie is affected. In the 
process, they notice the pollution ship heading for the Great Forest. 
The two use the time they have to destroy the ship. While they're gone, 
Robotnik sends King Acorn to the Void. Upon returning, they rescue the 
kids, but witness Uncle Chuck's roboticization. Rosie then takes the 
kids to Knothole, but first Sally asks Rosie to promise she'll never 
leave Knothole. Promise made, Sonic & Sally return to the present, 
eluding capture by Robotnik. The present is the same, except that Rosie 
is around (although never seen).<P>
Part 2 proved just as exciting and adventuresome as Part 1. The 
double challenge Sonic & Sally faced by having to prevent the kids 
from being roboticized AND preventing the ship from destroying the 
Great Forest & Knothole ups the intensity. All in all, this 2-parter is 
a must have.
<P><BR>
<B>Fed Up with Antoine/Ghost Busted (*)</B><P>
Two 15-minute episodes featuring Antoine & Tails.<P>
In "Fed Up with Antoine", Antoine is his usual self, annoying all in 
Knothole. Going off in the forest, he's taken by a biker group called 
Nasty Hyenas. They make Antoine their king, but don't tell him how they 
plan to eat him like all their kings. Sonic & the others come for the 
rescue.<P>
In "Ghost Busted", Sonic & Antoine take Tails on a campout/training 
mission. That night, Sonic tells ghost stories, and when Tails wakes up 
during the night, Antoine is gone. Tails notices a monster walking in 
the forest. After running scared for a few minutes, the monster turns 
out to be Antoine, who sleepwalked into some foxfire plants.<P>
Neither of these episodes had anything to do with the rest of the 
season. This is what made them so uninteresting. No Robotnik really 
takes away from it. Only salvagable thing was Tails' training.
<P><BR>
<B>Dulcy (**)</B><P>
During a routine mission in Robotropolis, Dulcy begins to experience 
strange feelings throughout her body. After saving Sonic from near 
roboticization, they return to Knothole, where the spells continue. 
Suddenly, she begins flying away from Knothole in a trance, and Sonic & 
Sally have to save her from being captured by SWATbots. It is 
discovered that Dulcy is being summoned to a place called Dragonsnest, 
the dragon mating ground. Furthermore, Robotnik has discovered about 
the place, and is heading there to capture all the dragons for 
roboticization. When Dulcy goes again, Sonic & Sally follow, and 
witness a dragon get captured. The three then find the dragon's egg, 
and manage to bring it back to Knothole for Bunnie to watch. The group 
then heads for Robotropolis. They save the mother dragon before she can 
be roboticized. Everyone gets back to Knothole just in time for the egg 
to hatch. The mom and baby then leave for a place where Robotnik won't 
find them.<P>
This was interesting, as it was the only time that dragon history was 
discussed. Still, they could've gone further into it. At least I got a 
big laugh seeing Bunnie getting tossed around while watching the 
bouncing egg.
<P><BR>
<B>The Void (**** 1/2)</B><P>
While heading through the Great Unknown, Sonic is almost sucked into a 
canyon vortex. Finding a strange ring, he heads to Knothole and fills 
Sally in on the Void and the ring. While Sonic heads to see Uncle 
Chuck, the ring zaps Sally & Bunnie, dragging them to the Void. In 
Robotropolis, Sonic learns about the Doomsday Project that Robotnik is 
planning, while Robotnik & Snively discover the emergence of the Void. 
They recall of the evil wizard Naugus who created the Void, and how 
Robotnik trapped him within prior to the coup. Back in Knothole, Sonic 
finds the others gone, but Nicole is still there. Sonic & Nicole head 
for the Void, but Robotnik is waiting. Sonic is cornered, so he 
retreats into the Void. There, he meets with Sally, Bunnie and Naugus. 
Naugus has explained that to escape, he needs Sonic's speed. Sonic 
is then trapped by Naugus trying to escape with the others. In another 
area of the Void, Sonic and the others discover a castle, and find King 
Acorn inside. Sonic takes him out of the Void, but the others learn 
from Ari that he actually took Naugus, and brings forth the real King. 
While Naugus reveals himself and tortures Robotnik, Sonic goes back in 
the Void for the others. Robotnik eventually gets away. Unfortunately, 
the King and Naugus begin to turn to crystal because they spent too 
much time in the Void. They are forced to return. Sally is brought to 
tears at this, and in saying goodbye, King Acorn gives Sally the list 
of the other Freedom Fighter groups.<P>
Reunions for the better and the worse. Sally meeting her father for the 
first time since the coup was one of the second most powerful pieces 
that was exhibited in the entire series. You can't help but feel sorry 
for her by episode's end. At the same time, our first knowledge of the 
Doomsday Project provides the first major setup for the finale.
<P><BR>
<B>The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (0)</B><P>
Another pair of 15-minute episodes, both starring Antoine.<P>
In "The Odd Couple", Sonic's hut is destroyed by Dulcy during a snow
storm. So, Sonic goes to stay with Antoine. Sonic's style of living 
turns Antoine's place upside down, & drives Antoine nuts. Sonic 
eventually gets so annoyed he leaves.<P>
In "Ro-Becca", Antoine is helping Rotor with a cleaning robot he's 
creating. However, Antoine gets so scared during a lightning storm that 
he accidentally activates the robot, which develops a crush on Antoine. 
Antoine spends the rest of his time trying to get Ro-Becca off his 
case.<P>
Unless you're an Antoine fan, these episodes are just incredibly 
unbearable, even moreso that the last double episode pack. One can only 
take so much of Antoine being his annoying self.
<P><BR>
<B>Cry of the Wolf (*** 1/2)</B><P>
In the Great Unknown, a band of Freedom Fighters known as the Wolf Pack 
succeeds in sabotaging a Doomsday test pod. Snively is sent to make 
repairs. Meanwhile, Sonic, Sally, Antoine & Dulcy are out seeking the 
Wolf Pack in order to establish the Freedom Fighter network. On route 
to the base, they discover an area that strikes lightining upon all who 
enter. When they reach the cave entrance to the base, Dulcy heads back 
while the others meet Lupe, the leader of the Wolf Pack and learn of 
their history. Meanwhile, Snively has gotten the test pod back online 
and has sent it through the area. The Freedom Fighters try to use a 
multitude of weapons stolen from Robotropolis on the pod, but to no 
avail. Sonic eventually destroys it by luring it into the lightning 
storm. Afterwards, contact is established with the other Freedom 
Fighter groups, and they gather together in Knothole to prepare for 
their greatest battle.<P>
This was the first glimpse into what any of the other Freedom Fighter 
groups were like. Another preparation for the finale as we would see 
the Wolf Pack again. Another plus of the ep was seeing Antoine go crazy 
every single time he thought the curse was coming to get him. Funny 
stuff.
<P><BR>
<B>Drood Henge (***)</B><P>
Uncle Chuck informs Sally of Robotnik's project to find the Drood Henge 
scrolls. The scrolls tell the location of the Deep Power Stones, which 
can provide awesome power or destruction based on how they are joined. 
Sonic & Tails discover Robotnik's plan elsewhere, harassing Snively in 
the process. When the Freedom Fighters regroup, they discover that 
Robotnik has the 1st stone. To prevent him getting the 2nd, Tails 
secretly devises a plan to trick Robotnik with a fake stone which they 
destroy right in front of him. Later, the gang finds the real stone, & 
Tails is officially made a Freedom Fighter.<P>
This is the episode that Tails fans enjoy the most, since it's the day 
he becomes a Freedom Fighter and is no longer treated like a kid. A 
good episode, and this plot plays again later on in the finale.
<P><BR>
<B>Spyhog (** 1/2)</B><P>
Thanks to info from Uncle Chuck, the Freedom Fighters stop another fuel 
shipment to the Doomsday Project. Frustrated, Robotnik believes that a 
spy is lurking about. He finds Uncle Chuck's bug and makes it 
malfunction, prompting Uncle Chuck to replace it. Meanwhile, Sally & 
Bunnie get word of this while accessing the plans to the Doomsday 
Project. The signal goes to Knothole, where Antoine goes to warn Uncle 
Chuck. However, Antoine's cowardice gets him captured, and Sonic must 
make the save. Later, Uncle Chuck is discovered & brought to Robotnik. 
Sonic saves him with a power ring before he is forced to reveal 
Knothole's location. Afterward, Uncle Chuck decides to stay in 
Robotropolis in a new outpost with some bots as disguises.<P>
Uncle Chuck was the main focus of this episode, and this time, he was 
the one who had a teary goodbye at episode's end. The fact that he's 
pained by not being together with Sonic is obvious and powerful. 
Meanwhile, the plans are now set for the ultimate battle that is...
<P><BR>
<B>The Doomsday Project (***** - DUH!)</B><P>
Robotnik sets the Doomsday Project into motion, launching pods all over 
Mobius. After Sonic takes out one that emerges near Knothole, Freedom 
Fighters from all over Mobius are brought together for the final 
confrontation. However, when a diversion attempt fails and all but the 
Knothole gang are captured, Sonic must go it alone. But Robotnik 
captures Sonic and sets him up for roboticization. Sonic escapes with 
the combined effort of 3 power rings. In an all-or-nothing final 
final effort, the gang resorts to using the Deep Power Stones. Sonic 
steals Robotnik's power stone from Robotropolis, and he & Sally use the 
incredible power they provide to destroy the Doomsday Project. Robotnik 
attempts to escape, his fate left uncertain. Snively, left behind, 
retreats to an underground elevator. As the Freedom Fighters celebrate 
their ultimate victory in Knothole, Snively emerges from the wreckage, 
vowing revenge. And behind him in the tunnel are the glowing red eyes 
of...<P>
The grand finale is easily the greatest and most powerful of all 
episodes. The cliffhanger ending is both the most intriguing and most 
infuriating element, particularly because this turned out to be the 
final episode. But more than that, emotions played just as strong here, 
if not stronger, than the adventure instinct. It is the ultimate 
expression of love as Sally vows to stand by her hero, willing to die 
for the cause as well. And the big kiss?...Well, what can I say? Words 
cannot descirbe how magical, moving and unforgetable it was. Next to 
seeing a marriage scene between Sonic & Sally (if we ever saw it 
happen), this is the most moving scene I've ever witnessed in all of 
animation. I would cry if I could. In short, it was a shame to see this 
show go.
<P><BR>
<CENTER><H3>The Lost 3rd Season</H3></CENTER><BR>
Well, I suppose after The Doomsday Project, you might be asking, "What 
happened next?" Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after 1995 
because the show's ratings bombed out versus Power Rangers. However, 
some time ago, Alessandro Sanasi (Tyro) caught up with Ben Hurst and he 
elaborated on what would have happened in the 3rd season.
<P>
According to Ben, the red eyes in the tunnel belonged to NAUGUS!  Yes, 
not Knuckles or Metal Sonic, but Naugus. Anyway, Snively tries 
valiantly to take control, but fails. On the verge of losing it all, 
he turns to the Void, where Naugus is torturing Robotnik (and having 
fun with it :-). Snively frees Naugus, and in the process also frees 
Robotnik & King Acorn. Now, Naugus assumes control, and starts his new 
command by trying to lure Sally into capture with the King as bait. 
Robotnik becomes Naugus' lackey. Snively, now a nobody, defects to the 
Freedom Fighters.
<P>
Well, while we may never see that 3rd season play out, we do have an 
alternative: the stories of Robert Brown & Francis Tolbert. Their 
stories began where the series left off, and every one has been 
exciting. Their stories are on Tyro's page 
<A HREF="http://www.franken.de/users/deco/stories/rbft.html">here</A>.

This is the list of episodes for the 2nd season. The 1st season can be
