<p>At a time when the videogame industry was pretty much all Super Mario, the struggling Genesis needed a name for itself.
Headed by Yuji Naka and The Sonic Team, Sonic The Hedgehog was created and soon took the top spot as both mascot and headliner
of a company. 

<p>The concept of STH is that of a fast-moving character running through various intricately-designed courses. 
The key feature (one which would remain a Sonic standard) is the Sonic's spin, with which the player destroys "badniks" 
and perform other tricks to advance to te goal. Ring-collecting introduced an innovative twist on the "coin collecting" system started by Mario. But instead of the rings counting as money, they were instead also vital to your life. 
You can live as long as you have 1 ring alone, but lose all rings, then touch an enemy and you die. And as each board progresses, it gets harder to keep the rings. ^_^ 
At the time it was released - Sonic 1 had a number of innovations to go along with its 16-bit graphics:

<p><table border=0><tr><td>
<blockquote><font face="Arial" size=-1>
<LI><b><u>Speedy Frames Rates</b></u> Speed of this caliber in a videogame had never been pulled off before.
<LI><b><u>Music</b></u> The only videogame at the time that had music of equal or better value is that of the Megaman series. 
Featuring catchy tunes composed by Koji Kondo, there are tunes from this game that are instantly recogniseable to some gamers.
<LI><b><u>Level Design</b></u> Linear gameplay but with a twist, instead of just following a straight set path, Sonic 1 helped cement exploration of levels. The more you explore, the more goodies you can find.
<LI><b><u>Character Design</b></u> Character design became vital to the existance of Sonic. Spiked hair, a red, white, and blue color scheme, and an "attitude" to match, define Sonics outlook.

<b><p>This is the first zone and the easiest. The main dangers are spikes, Buzzbombers, and other small enemies. Try and keep going fast, that way you can avoid more dangers and get to higher up power ups. The Act 3 boss is Robotnik in his Egg-O-Matic with a checker wrecker ball attached to the bottom. Get underneath the platforms when it swings toward you and duck at the edge. It won't hit you. When it swings the other way, jump on the platform and jump at Robotnik's ship. 8 such hits will destroy his ship.

<b><p>This one's a killer. The first in a long tradition of Pinball Sonic boards - those springs and bumpers get on your nerves after a while especially since they have a tendency of bouncing you into badniks. Just keep your head and you'll be cool. Watch out for that rolling ball badnik - Roller. He gets annoying after a while as well and tends to show up in the least expected places. The Act 3 boss is Robotnik with a spike on his Egg-O-Matic. He'll try to drop down on you with the needle. Dodge him and hit him as he does this. He'll come up with a block of the platform youre standing on, so get rid of him quick or you'll have no platform left at all!  8 hits will send him running.

<b><p>Get ready for an underwater extravaganza.  It takes 30 seconds to drown folks. It takes 5 seconds for the first "ding" 
warning, and the warning repeats at 10 seconds and 15 seconds. After 18 seconds (or 3 seconds after the 3rd warning), the 
"danger" music and countdown start. The countdown lasts 12 seconds. Make sure that you keep enough air 
to survive at all times.  Get air bubbles when you can and try to stay on the 
surface when you can.  Other than that, the zone isn't extremely hard.  The 
water slows you down, so be careful.  Robotnik is pretty easy in Act 3.  All 
you have to do is get to the top of all his traps.  When you do, he'll run 
away, leaving you to finish the zone.</center></TD>

Watch where youre going in hilly areas, especially since the bottom of the level is filled with pits. To beat the Star Light zone boss, get on one end of the spring that Robotnik doesn't drop the spike ball on.  When he drops the ball, it will bounce you up.  Bounce up and over him and hit him from the top.  Eight hits puts him out.

<b><p>This isn't extremely hard but it isnt exactly easy either.  Keep your wits about you though, or you'll be a Sonic pancake in no time!
