whacking them on the head with a RING! This Japanese-only game features 4 short levels.

    in this zone. Platforms you stand on sometimes aren't platforms but are disguised holes
    instead. Those platforms without grass on them are the holes while the ones with grass are
    regular platforms. The boss of this stage is a little bit tricky. He's a bouncing egg bot
    that shoots 4 plasma shots forward every time he jumps up. The best thing to do is stay to
    the left until he bounces and shoots twice. Then, spindash under him the third time he
    bounces just before he shoots. Hit him in the back continously. Just as he is about to
    jump on top of you, spin dash back to the left. Repeat this pattern until you have hit him
    8 times. He will explode and you will be free to move onto the next zone. </p>

    opening one of those annoying warp tubes. Break open the monitor and go into the tube. You
    will go through a series of loops before emerging near another tube. There's an
    invincibility monitor blocking the entrance again. Break open the monitor and enter the
    tube like before. You'll go through several tubes like this, all except the last one
    exactly identical to one another. Pay attention to this. It will help you to tell when
    you're in the last tube. When you reach an unfamiliar turn, hold up on the D-pad. You
    should enter a junction that will drop you next to the emerald.</b></font></td>

    into full gear - he's &quot;roboticised&quot; (for lack of a better word) an entire zone!
    Even more important the famous Green Hill Zone from MANY of the Sonic Games which has now
    undergone a cool slick metal makeover! At a lot of places in this zone you can break
    through the ground with a good jump. There may be more power-ups down below, so search
    carefully. Other than the slanted bridges again, this zone is pretty easy. The boss here
    is just as simple. A floating Eggbot will try to fire three lasers at you at different
    levels, the bottom, middle, and top of the screen respectively. Then he will fly back to
    the bottom and repeat the process. Be careful when you hit him. Beneath him are layers of
    spikes with one hole in the middle, so when you hit him try not to fall on the spikes. The
    easiest way to take him out is to jump on him when he's down low and keep bouncing up and
    down on him. This way, you'll keep hitting him without worrying about his shots and when
    he explodes you'll fall in that hole between the spikes where you'll be safe. Eight hits
    kills this dude. </p>

    <p align="center">Chaos Emerald #4 (White): Getting more difficult now, this level is a
    mad dash to the upper right edge of the board. Use the rocket shoes to get ahead, holding
    up and right on the directional pad until they run out for maximum distance. Partway
    through the level, you will reach what look like stairs with a spring that points to the
    left on each step. You can get past this spot by jumping on top of the springs as if they
    were ledges and being careful not to run into the spring on the step in front of you. In
    several other places, you may encounter another annoying obsticle, in the form of a
    downward slope that ends abruptly in a high wall. To get past this, spindash at the top of
    the slope, then jump just as you start to move downward. Your speed should carry you up to
    the top of the wall. This move is somewhat difficult to perform. Above all, try to think
    fast here, because you'll need every second you can get. The emerald is on a ledge in the
    upper right corner. I don't think you can reach it without rocket shoes. You can find some
    in the general vacinity of the ledge, a ways left of the nearby collapsing floor...</b></font><a

    Hey, wait a minute, there's no water here! We got shammed! Oh well. This zone is a heck of
    an easy one with no underwater action to worry about. The boss here, much like the others,
    is simple to begin with - but has numerous forms. About 6 little egg bouncers come at you.
    Just nab them all. Then, all of a sudden, a giant egg bouncer drops from the sky! He falls
    to the middle of the screen and uses the same technique as the Sleeping Egg Zone boss,
    except he only fires one shot. Your technique is different though. Go all the way to the
    right side of the screen. Stay there until he reaches your position. He gets close to
    crushing you, but can't because of the limited space. When he comes down, jump on him and
    continue to bounce on him until you've taken eight hits away. He will then fly up and his
    top half will detach from his bottom half. Six missles will then shoot out of the bottom
    half. The first three will come from the left and land at the left, the middle, and the
    right of the screen respectively. The other three will come from the right and will blow
    up at the right, the middle, and the left respectively. Dodge them all. Then, the egg
    bouncer will come down a little ways. Smash him now, and one hit will kill this form. He
    then explodes and you can go on to the last stage. </p>

    and may take several tries to complete successfully. You'll have to work your way through
    a complicated maze of high-speed tubes in order to reach the room that holds the emerald.
    Fortunately, to save you hours of pulling your hair out, I've solved the maze for you.
    Enter the tube in front of you and hold right on the directional pad until you enter a
    pipe near the top of the maze that is zig-zagging up and down, then hold down and left. If
    you did it correctly, you should be spat out into a new room and be careening towards a
    springboard. Jump <u>*immediately*</u> or you will hit the spring and go bouncing right
    back into the tube (argh!). Timing is <u>CRUCIAL</u> here, and it may take many, many,
    many tries just to make it past that bloody spring. Once you've successfully cleared this
    annoying springloaded obsticle, head past it and to the left, and you should find the
    emerald awaiting your grasp. .</b></font></td>

    annoying @$$ warp tubes all around the place and some of them lead to power-ups. Some of
    them however, lead to sudden death so be very careful and choosy about which warp tube you
    take. There are also mine carts that you can ride that will take you to power-ups or
    death, so be very careful in this zone. Slanted bridges are here too, most of which have
    spikes planted underneath. When you reach Act 3, jump in the first mine cart and travel
    down the hill. Just as it reaches the end, jump on the small platform and take the warp
    tube above it to 4 ten ring monitors. You'll need these, as you travel on to the final
    boss....Doc Robotnik! No special stage for this emerald - the Red Emerald. Just beat
    Eggman at the end of the game with the other five emeralds, and it's yours. <img

    <p align="center">In his first form, he'll come in a small walking mech. Jump on top of
    him and keep bouncing on top. He'll shoot lasers, some of which will bounce around the
    room. It's almost positive you'll get hit unless you get lucky. Be prepared and MAKE SURE
    YOU HAVE A RING - A WHOPPING Twenty-four hits will do this form in. Then, he'll come at
    you in his second and final form. The bottom of his mech will grow larger. First, he'll
    fly to the left at the top of the screen. Then, he'll zoom from left to right at the
    bottom of the screen. Jump him for now. Then, he'll come in a downwards arc from either
    side. He may do this twice. Hit him now! One hit will kill him in this form. Now, watch
    tubby try to run away from you. He'll jump on top a platform and escape. (how can that
    thing stay together with that much weight on it?) Congratulations! You've beaten the game!
    Now sit back and enjoy the credits! You'll now be able to see Sonic running and jumping
    inside a chaos emerald during the credits. Wow, I hear you say. At least it isn't a 'Try
    Again.'</b></font></td>
