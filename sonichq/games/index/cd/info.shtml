Dr. Robotnik's latest scheme involves the mysterious Little Planet, which appears on the last month of every year over Never Lake. The Little Planet houses the seven Time Stones, with which the holder obtains the ability to travel through time and space. With the control of time, nothing could stop the Eggman! Not to freak, because Sonic the Hedgehog is on the case! Unfortunately, Robotnik has decided to unleash Metal Sonic to keep the hedgehog hero at bay; and kidnap Amy Rose to further complicate the problem. Infact, Robotnik's already made use of the Little Planet's lack of any boundaries on time, and has placed robot machines in the past so he controls the future. Now Sonic's got to stop Robotnik, destroy the robot machines, collect the seven Time Stones, save Amy Rose, and deal with Metal Sonic on a tiny planet where time has no meaning. A hedgehog's work is never done....Introducing Amy Rose, Metal Sonic, and the Time Stones this is the first and only Sonic game to come out for Sega CD, with new characters, 3 endings, and anime entrances and closings this is considered by Sonic fans as one of the best Sonic games of all time! It came out in November of 1993, along with Sonic Spinball and was just rereleased for the PC in 1995, and the features are the same, the codes, the characters, everything. The only difference is that this time around they got Amy Rose's name right in the instruction booklet. This game presents time travel; Sonic can go into the past, present, and future realities of each zone! The future depends on whether you trash Robotnik's roboticizer in the past of each act; if you do, the future will be a good future where the animals are allowed to run free. If not, it will be a bad future where Robotnik is allowed to run amok. If you get the Roboticizers in the past of every act, you will see the good ending of the game. Otherwise, you'll see the bad ending...This game consists of the Palmtree Panic Zone, Collision Chaos Zone, Tidal Tempest Zone, Quartz Quadrant Zone, Wacky Workbench Zone, Stardust Speedway Zone - possibly the most famous Sonic Zone and the race with Metal Sonic - and the final confrontation with Robotnik, The Metallic Madness Zone!

This is a pretty straightforward zone.  After the first <B>BIG</B> loop, head 
to the left for some Super Sneakers.  There's nothing extremely hard about 
this zone except for avoiding those annoying Mosquito bots. Transport yourself to the past and stay at the upper part of the screen to locate the Robot Transport device and stay near the bottom areas of the levels to find The Metal Sonic Projection Unit. In Act 3 of every zone, you are transported to the future where 
you must fight Robotnik.  Here, you must fight Robotnik in a large walking mech robot.  
When you first start out, get behind him before he lands on the ground.  This 
way, you can attack him and he can't attack you.  Every hit you get, a part 
of him falls off.  After everything falls off, he'll fly away.  Go to the 
right and break open the Prison Egg to release the flower seeds.</P>

Another Casino Night / Spring Yard type zone here.  Flippers and bumpers bounce you around 
a whole lot and to top that spikes run rampant along with Batbots and those annoying Grasshoper things that shoot repeated blades. Spikes dot the area so be careful where you step.  In Act 3, 
Robotnik attacks with a machine that drops bubbles. Sounds stupid, yeah but he's not that easy to beat. Watch out for them and 
use the flippers to launch yourself at Robotnik. When you hit him he'll fly 
higher up to escape you. Avoid the spikes and use the flippers to get up there and plug him 
again.  After you hit him a couple of times he'll fly off leaving you to 
free the flowers.</P>

How come hedgehogs hate water, yet Sega won't stop putting in flodded zones?  
Some questions may never be answered.  At any rate, Sonic can't ponder over 
questions very long with the danger of drowning.  Gulp the air bubbles to 
keep yourself alive underwater.  Be careful in the currents and watch out for 
spikes.  In Act 3, Robotnik will attack with his Egg-O-Matic and a shield 
of bubbles surrounding him.  Dodge the gun blasts he fires and keep gulping 
the bubbles out of his shield to stay alive.  Once all the bubbles are gone, 
plug him once to get rid of him.</P>

A zone of shining crystals, Robotnik is searching for the Time Stones here.  
Many of the enemies are easily avoidable and easily killed.  Except for 
more spikes than Collision Chaos, there's not much to worry about here.  
Touch the arrows on the signs to reverse the directions of the conveyer 
belts.  In Act 3, you'll be running on a conveyer belt with spikes right 
behind you.  Keep running or else you're gonna be impaled.  Robotnik will 
drop spiked balls at you.  Dodge them.  Keep repeating this.  After a while, 
the conveyer belt will rub away the bottom of the capsule Robotnik is in.  
When it's all gone, Robotnik will run away leaving you to free the flowers.

Be careful in this zone, the ground is not always grounded.  If you're 
standing on it when it starts to flash, you'll be bounced <B>WAY</B> up into 
the air.  Other than that, there isn't much to watch out for.  There's a 
secret in Act 2 past.  At one point you'll reach an area that looks like the 
bottom-right side of a circle.  Go to the left into the wall to find a statue 
that when you touch gives away a hundred rings.  Leave the passageway and 
come back to get more rings. Act 3 is a little hard, Robotnik will float in midair and do nothing....sounds easy? NOT SO!! Hit him 
and he will fly up sending down a barrage of rocks, Jump on a SOLID block that falls.  Now the floor will begin to electrocute and go into bounce mode! When the elctricity starts, 
it will send the blocks flying in the air.  Quickly jump to another block 
and jump through the hole in the ceiling. Time your jumps carefully because Sonic's weight will make whatever block he is already on jump lower than the others. Hit Robotnik again and keep 
repeating this pattern. This time watching for falling spikes as well. When you reach the very top, hit Robotnik to get rid 
of him once and for all.</P>

This zone is pretty easy, at least the first two acts are. The hardest thing on the first two zones in avoiding The Double Flasher Badniks that follow your moves and connects with a ray beam. Hit a sign to 
close one path and open up the adjacent one.  This is a great way to escape 
enemies.  Act 3 however, is a doozy. In Act 3, you must race Metal Sonic in your final confrontation with him.  Robotnik flies behind the 
whole way shooting a laser beam, so don't lag behind or else you'll get 
fried.  When Metal Sonic glows yellow ala Super Sonic, DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!  When he just plain 
floats you can run right past him.  If you reach the finish line before he 
does, a wall will close in front of him and Robotnik will wipe him out by 
mistake.  If he reaches the finish line before you do, you'll get fried. Cross the finish line at the same time - you'll get fried. Its NOT as easy as it sounds...

This is the final zone in this game. Filled to the brim with spikes and badniks it can become QUITE annoying! When you come up to a tube that lets 
you choose your direction, try to keep going right.  Be careful on the 
platforms that rotate and drop you.  During the act, you may encounter a 
shrinking beam.  You'll have to run around small until you find a beam that 
enlarges you again.  In Act 3, Robotnik will attack in his Egg-O-Matic with 
4 pillars attaches to it.  He will try to roll over you.  Hit him twice to 
get rid of two pillars.  He will then shoot the pillars off to try to hit 
you.  Dodge them and hit him.  With only one pillar left, he tries to 
use the pillar as a pogo stick and crush you.  One more hit defeats him.  Sit 
back and watch the ending.
