<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>This zone is pretty straightforward. Rescuing the Flickies is pretty easy and virtually nothing will impede your path here barring a few bombs and lasers. In this game, there are 3 acts, but the third act is always nothing but a boss - usually Robotnik in varying forms of his Super Egg-O-Matic! In Act 3 of this zone, Robotnik floats after you and drops a spiked ball which chases you. Watch out for it and plug Robotnik when he comes down to pick up the ball. Its BEST to stand at the TOP of one of the inclines but try getting Rootnik to position himself at the BASE of the incline. This makes an easier jump for you as hitting the Egg-O-matic will do NOTHING but hitting the glass of the Egg-O-Matic produces the desired effect...Five hits gets rid of him</center></td></tr></table></div></a>

<a name="z2"><div align="center"><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>There's not much to worry about here - BUT when on the Saturn the fog and flamethrowers can be a DEFINITE hindrance...This zone is a bit more tough. The fog and rain also impede your search for the Flickies. Watch out for the flame shooters and the spiked balls rotating around. In Act 3, Robotnik equips the Egg-O-Matic to a large Lion/Knight statue that tries to crush you with its hands. Watch out and jump on the hand that hits the ground. When Robotnik brings the hand back up, plug him but BE SURE to aim for the windshield. Not only that but try to stay off the ground as much as possible due to the hail of bullets when shot...Five hits gets rid of him.</center></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>This one's a killer. This is one of the harder zones in the game and seeing it for the first time is one of the biggest reasons why. The zone was PURPOSELY designed to be distracting often tempting you to stray from the path and right into oncoming dnger...Watch out for holes in the ground, spikes come up out of them if you stand on them for too long. You better be glad that the game doesn't make you die after 10 minutes are up, because this zone would be mighty hard if it did! Its JUST that tedious...In Act 3, Robotnik has returned - but this time equipping the Egg-O-matic with LONG spiked arms meant to place permanent airholes in Sonic! Eggman attacks by slamming the ground with its hands - It sounds silly but playing it is a whole nother cup of tea...Grab one ring. Don't hog them all at once, you'll be able to take more hits this way. When Robotnik comes, run around in a circle on the raised area in the middle, the one with with the spikes on top, leaving enough distance between Sonic and Robotnik. Eggman does his Smash Attack him FROM THE BACK! An attack from the front would be suicide as you'd run right into his spikes. Jump back on the ledge and repeat this pattern HOWEVER duly note that EACH time you hit him, he gets faster and faster - so stay alert. After 5 hits he's gone. </center></td></tr></table></div></a>

<a name="z4"><div align="center"><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>This zone is sort of a break after Spring Stadium, but it isn't a picnic itself. Watch out for the exploding snowmen, they pack a wallop. Also be wary of the villians on the ice - sonic's shoes doesn't make very good traction and one wrong move will result in a loss of rings! Also, in snow movement areas, its okay to follow the flow of the current - BUT DONT follow too far as a bed of spikes usually await at the end...Other than the snowmen, this board isn't extremely hard. In Act 3, Robotnik returns with the Bomb And Freeze Generator in his Egg-O-Matic that he used in Sonic 3 (Ice Cap Zone)! However THIS TIME its got an upgrade....Robotnik will chase you around with six generators rotating around his ship, each one shooting out freezing air. So freezing, in fact Sonic will freeze if the air touches him. To get out of it, jump 4 times. Don't think the ice is protection, if you get hit in the ice, you'll get out of it, AND lose your rings. Next, Robotnik will drop snowman bombs. These will either go off after a little while, or when Sonic gets near them. He will drop one if Sonic just hit him, or two if Sonic didn't. He gradually loses the things rotating aroung his ship, but chases you faster. Eight hits is the max this time around....</center></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>This zone is PURE-D EVIL !!! And without the assistance of a flame shield it just gets worse. If you find one bully for you - KEEP IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE! This zone is a lot harder than Diamond Dust with all the lava around. Whenever you see a blue platform, jump on it and spin dash to make it go up. In Act 3, Robotnik has attached the Egg-O-Matic to his new Fire Cannon attached deep into the bubbling lava pits of Volcano Valley!! This boss is NOT easy especially with his homing flame the chases after Sonic!! There are two methods to beating him and both suck as far as easiness is concerned - 1) Get a few rings, jump on the gray base columns and keep hitting him until you're out of rings. Then get some more rings and hit him again! but be sure to keep a steady supply of rings, otherwise its fried hedgehog...2) Method to this isnt really that much easier...Get 1 ring. Run around, jumping from platform to platform, while the fire chases you. When the fire dies down , jump on the pipe, (careful now,) and hit him. Jump back on the platform, and repeat this procedure until he's burned!</center></td></tr></table></div></a>

<a name="z6"><div align="center"><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>In this zone, you must avoid laser shooting bots. Learn to manipulate the air jets make you float so you can reach higher platforms. Most of this stage is strategy but its NOT as easy as it sounds. More tedious like Rusty Ruin except toughter...When you walk in a small room, you'll be sent through the pipes to another area of the act. In Act 3, you'll face Eggman and The Conveyor Belt!!! Jump above the spiked bots and jump at Robotnik when you get the chance. Get 1 or 2 rings before the conveyor starts. Avoid the spiked object that come out. When Robotnik arrives, hit him, and avoid the missiles. I sugest hitting him from the side. When you do this though, if you take too long, those spiked things will come out before Robotnik's done! Eight hits will beat him</center></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>Welcome to Robotnik's final base !!! He's got a surprise awaiting at the end.....You're getting real close to Robotnik, he hasn't even had time to stick the Flickies in robots yet! Jump on the capsules to free the birds. In Act 2, there are no Flickies. Your main objective is to get up the large Robotnik robot being built and hop up its nose. When you do this you'll have beaten the act. In Act 3, Robotnik attacks in several different machines. In each form, he'll shoot weapons at you, whether it be lasers or small blue balls. Avoid them and jump at the shoulders of his arms. After 3 hits on each shoulder, Robotnik will escape to his next form, then follow him by jumping down the hole that appears. Phase I: (Hits: 8) Stand under the spike ball. Before it slams down, you'll hear a noise that sounds like Sonic going into a spin dash. When the mace slams down, you'll hear another noise. Remember it well. Before the noise stops, hit the colored light at the end of the chain the mace is connected to hit him. It takes 4 hits for one mace. Do the other one, using the same procedure. Phase II: (Hits: 8)Same thing as above. Start out on the left side. Hit the light before the noise stops. Then, run to the other side, before the fire catches up to you. Repeat, alternating sides. Phase III: (Hits: 8) Alternate again. This time hit the light ASAP. Then you'll have less bullets to deal with when switching sides. Start on the left. After you beat the third form, if you don't have all 7 Chaos Emeralds, sit back and watch the bad ending. If you have all 7, get ready for the Final Fight....</center></td></tr></table></div></a>

<a name="z8"><div align="center"><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="50%"><center>Welcome to the mystery zone - The Flicky Zone: Where Robotnik has now gained full access!!! Here, Robotnik attacks in 5 different forms - with his Egg-O-matic no longer functioning he has only one thing left - The Panic Puppet Battlesuit, miniaturized enough to give Sonic a run for his money!!! Phase I: (Hits: 1) Stand in the middle. When the hands are aimed at you. Run to the side. Do this again. When Robotnik goes into the luminated tiles, hit him. TAKE ONLY HALF OF THE RINGS WITH YOU!!!! Phase II: (Hits: 1) When Robotnik shoots the fire at you, run around the grid. He'll do this again. Keep running. When he pops up again, stand to right of him. When he comes into the tiles, hit him. If you miss. Next shot Robotnik takes, you can hit him. Just don't let his 3rd shot hit you! Phase III: (Hits: 1) Stand on the tile closest to you. When you hear the second noise run around the perimeter. Repeat this twice the hands will then position themselves. Stand on the tile closest to you. When they go in opposite directions, jump to the upper most corner. Again, hit Robotnik. Phase IV: (Hits: 1) Run around the tiles. Then the homing missiles probably won't hit you. When Robotnik pops up. Hit him. Do it quick. He won't stay in long this time. Phase V: (Hits: 1) Go to the area to the right of Robotnik. (The one you can see!) Go to the uppermost corner. No bullets can get you there! When he goes on to the grid, guess what! That's right! Hit him. Note: the Spin dash is no good in this boss. Phase VI: (Hits: 5) Phases I-V repeat themselves! This is why I ask you leave half of the rings. After you fully defeat the Eggman - sit back, relax, and enjoy your well deserved ending....</center></td>

<tr><td colspan=2 bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center>The means for getting to a Special Stage were identical in all three versions of the game (take 50 Rings to Knuckles or Tails), but the stages varied. The Genesis version has Sonic running along a pseudo-3D "bridge" above nothing - lava or Mobius, jumping over ridges, avoiding mines, and collecting the specified amount of Rings. The Saturn version's were identical to the old Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Genesis Special Stages, only in true 3D. Like the old ones, they had Sonic running through half-tubes collecting the specified number of rings, while avoiding mines and other obstacles. The PC versions appear to be similar to the Saturn's versions, only not quite as impressive.</center></td></tr></table></div></a>
