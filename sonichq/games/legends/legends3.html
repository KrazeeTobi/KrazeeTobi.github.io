Sonics TRUE origins lay in 2 places. Believe it or not, there are TWO origins which are considered canon by Sega Of America and Sega Europe. Sega of America - AS OF RECENT - has announced that it goes by the Archie comic as canon due to the coming of the new cartoon Sonic Underground. BUT Sega of America has Fleetways origin - the origin that was originally posted on Sega Of Americas page? So just WHAT is the correct origin? The only real and FAIR way to say it is that BOTH ARE as the comic has - as of late seemed to adapt certain elements of the "Kintobor" storyline used by Fleetway. One used by Sega America and one used by Sega Europe. Its complicated and would probably cause boatloads of arguments (as it normally does among Sonic fans) but to understand what we mean keep reading....

<p> The very first Sonic comic strip ANYWHERE was published in the United States as an Advertising Supplement in 'Disney Adventures Magazine' Volume 2 No. 1, November 1991 (the issue with Michael Jordan on the cover). Story & art were done by Francis Mao. This 6-page short story told its readers how Sonic got his blue color, and how a scientist named Kintobor was turned into the evil Robotnik. This comic is viewable in the comics info page. In the same year, on May 29, 1993, Fleetway Publications started another Sonic comic version in England. Unlike Archie Comics, Fleetway Publications used the same story about Sonic's origin that had aleady been shown in the previously-menitoned Disney Adventures Magazine, and created a background which was mostly based on the Sonic games from SEGA. In fact they even went back to eplore this fact and used it many times in stories - most notably "The Origin Of Sonic" and "Brotherhood Of The Metallix". And now for your reading - Sonic's original origin: Courtesy of Fleetway And the Disney Adventures comic....

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<p>In a feat that would forever change his life, a brown spiny hedgehog named Sonic found he had tunneled himself into the laboratory of Dr. Ovi Kintobor, a brilliant scientist. Dr. Kintobor told Sonic how he was trying to improve Mobius by ridding the planet of all evil. Sonic listened as Kintobor explained how he planned to do this using his invention, the "Retro Ortital Chaos Compressor" (or "ROCC" for short). The ROCC can attract and transfer evil from one object into another. Technically speaking, the ROCC consists of thousands of gold rings that constantly flow good karma around the machine's core as it transfers evil from one object into another. Dr. Kintobor found the perfect objects for the transfer: six dazzling emeralds, which he called "Chaos Emeralds." Kintobor managed to pack most of the world's evil into the Emeralds, but found that once the Emeralds became evil, they were highly unstable and could "blow" at any moment. To make the Chaos Emeralds safe, Kintobor began to search for a seventh Gray Emerald which would neutralize their violent forces stabilizing the Chaos Emeralds. 
Kintobor installed personal computers throughout the zones of Mobius so that anyone passing by could input information that might lead to the discovery of the Gray Emerald. He also had his ROCC ready to transfer the last bit of the world's evil into the Gray Emerald. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic and Kintobor became good friends. Under Kintobor's tutelage, Sonic developed his natural running abilities to an extraordinary degree. Using Kintobor's experimental, supersonic treadmill, Sonic trained every day to increase his speed until one day - he broke the sound barrier! 
Kintobor invented special red sneakers for Sonic to protect his feet from the intense heat generated by the friction on his soles. As a matter of fact, the first time Sonic ran at the speed of sound, his quills and body became blue-hot from the supersonic shock waves and from then on, Sonic remained permanently blue....

<p>One fateful afternoon, Sonic was hanging out near the lab reading. When Kintobor suggested they have a snack, Sonic raided the lab refrigerator only to discover a single hard-boiled egg. "Peee-euugh!" said Sonic as he sniffed the rotten egg. He handed the egg to Kintobor who was carefully entering a series of complex commands into the ROCC. Unfortunately, no one is perfect, including Kintobor...because when Kintobor entered a slight miscalculation, the ROCC began to spark. In just seconds, several astonishing things happened: The ROCC went bananas and zapped the Chaos Emeralds, Kintobor and the rotten egg in his hand... The ROCC began to transfer some of the evil stored in the Chaos Emeralds over to Kintobor, changing him into the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik...Robotnik immediately took on the physical characteristics of an egg, and bloated to grotesque proportions and the ROCC then exploded, scattering its golden rings throughout the zones. 
That's how the formerly good Kintobor became the now hopelessly evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik, a megalomaniac who wants to control all of Mobius.... </p>

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<p>"I shall control Mobius forever!" Robotnik ranted. 
"Oh Yeah? And how are you going to do that?" Sonic asked, cleverly fishing for Robotnik's plan. "The Emeralds - it's all in the Emeralds! Now I am evil like them. Beautiful, symmetrical, and unstoppable! I shall launch them into space and they'll help me control the world and NO ONE will ever find the Gray Emerald. No one!" Robotnik said as he was nearly frothing at the mouth with delusions of grandeur. All of the sudden Robotnik realized his mistake....."YOU! NOW YOU KNOW MY PLAN- you little walking pincushion! "YOU SHALL BE DESTROYED!" With that threat, Robotnik lunged at Sonic. But Sonic was too fast. He bolted out the back door to the lab and headed for the Green Zone to warn his friends as Robotnik's curses echoed behind him.</p>

<p>Archie Comics have always worked a tad different from Fleetway. Before, Archie was never considered canon as Sega Of America instructed them to follow the guidelines set about by the cartoons - which VERY loosely followed the games. The cartoon that Archie was instructed to follow was "Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog", a cartoon with about as much sense as an ongoing mack truck. Needless to say fans DID NOT like this version of the cartoon, and ADAMANTLY did not want it in the comic and wanted to see a change. There WAS another alternative. Waiting in the wings was the better of the two toons, a Saturday morning cartoon called "Sonic The Hedgehog" in which Sonic battled Dr. Robotnik with the help of the Freedom Fighters - Princess Sally, Bunnie Rabbot, Antione D'Coolette, Rotor The Walrus, and Tails The Fox. But there was a problem. While "Adventures" loosely followed the games, it is arguable that the Saturday morning toon went off on a tangent of its own at times. Due to fan requests Archie went to thier Sega liasons and requested that a change be made. Sally and the rest of the FF's were already in the book so it WOULDNT be hard ushering in the switches. And so around Issue 19, "Night Of A Thousand Sonics" which introduced the popular concept of parallel worlds to the book, fans began to see a gradual change. Now Sega Of America had for the LONGEST TIME used the Fleetway Origin, but due to asinine marketing on thier part we fast forward to 1998 where they have marketed out Sega to DiC Animation in making "Sonic Underground". A show that neither Archie, nor fans liked very much due to concept...It is as of recent that Sega Of America has officially considered Archie canon and as of now Archie, under SOA's liasons will be moving thier stories MORE towards the games. In fact, to further prove this, it was Ken Penders' (Archie writer) version of Knuckles The Echidna that Sega wished DiC to use as Knux would make his appearances in the new cartoon. And in order to blot out the problem that Sonic Underground causes due to continuity SOA has even allowed Archie to tackle it as an alternate universe so that the continuity that already is will remain in tact.</p>

<p>Sonic's origin story here lies heavily on the origins of Robotnik and even Mobius itself. Sonic and Robotniks origin have been let loose in small dabbles but its Robotniks origins origin that is more shrouded in mystery as the Archie Comic's base has always been that of revealing the mysteries one at a time rather than dumping them all extremely quickly. Specific stories to note are "Blast To The Past" (a cartoon episode), "The Naugus Trilogy", and "Brave New World".

<p>Many years ago, after the onslaught of the Great War, there existed a beautiful city called Mobotropolis. This city, under the rule of the Acorn royal family, became a hub of technological advancement, and it was this city that other countries around mobius looked up to. Ruled by the benevolent Queen And King Acorn, Mobotropolis became the envy of cities everywhere. But more imoportant was the birth of a single child that would change the life of those on the planet - Sonic The Hedgehog...Raised by his Uncle Chuck due to the mysterious absence of his parents, Sonic grew up among the other children of the city and gre to be VERY popular due to his speed and joviality! All was great for the children of Mobotropolis...until the day Robotnik came.</p>

<p>Sonic and the children watched in horror as they were separated from thier loved ones and herded off to the secret village of Knothole in the Great Forest! All that was known to them was that a man called Robotnik had invaded thier happy land...In reality however Robotnik had done more than just "take over". Banishing King Acorn into an unstable zone called "The Zone Of Silence", Robotnik systematically began to roboticise all of the helpless people of Mobotropolis. Using them as his own controlled army, he gradually began to take over the planet in various areas. Others rose up against him - but many failed in thier attempts. Soon Robotnik had moved from mere invader to near dictator! It would be years before Sonic would finally come face to face with the fatman but when he did, it would prove to begin what would be one of the greatest adventures of his life...</p>

Ten years have passed and Sonic - now in his sixteenth year - has never forgotten the events of those days. Over time many groups of "Freedom Fighters" have risen to the occasion 
But the greatest one is a team led by the King's own daughter, 
and championed by the fastest 
and way-coolest hero in the land!.... 
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG!
