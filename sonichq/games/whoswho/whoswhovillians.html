Every Good Guy must have a villian - and Robotnik is NO EXCEPTION. He's the core villian of ALL Sonic universes - Archie, Anime, and Sega - and everywhere he's recognised as the ultimate evil against Sonic! Also known as Eggman, Robotnik is the official villian of the ENTIRE planet! Dr. Robotnik, putting his genious I.Q. to work, devised a machine that turns innocent animals into robot slaves - the roboticiser!!! Sonic usually trashes his plans, but the Eggman's never without a new evil scheme up his sleeve, and he's persistent enough to try them all. He's even gone as far as roboticising ebntire zones! (<i>Sonic Chaos</i>)...Another frequent target of Robotnik are the Chaos Emeralds. With one of these all-powerful jewels, not even Sonic could stand in the way of the Doc's takeover plans. He hasn't managed to keep any yet, but his technology is only getting better, and from so many mistakes he could only have learned...Although his size keeps his pace down on foot, Robotnik gets around using a speedy hovercraft known as the Egg Typhoon. He used it in both Chaos Grand Prix tournaments, the World Grand Prix, and just about everywhere else. His main device however is the Egg-O-Matic which can "attach" itself to various weapons of destruction....Robotnik's home city is the Metropolis Zone, but he has a huge mini-planet known as the Death Egg as well as a super airship called the Egg Carrier, that could destroy Mobius in a second. Luckily, Sonic's frequently kept it out of space long enough to do any damage, but the Eggman never gives up...

Before there was the "Metal Sonic" there was the "Silver Sonic" !!! Built without free will like his counterpart - The Silver Sonic Prototype was Robotnik's first attempt at creating a robot version of his arch enemy, Sonic the Hedgehog. Although Silver Sonic was larger than Sonic, and had a deathly sharp version of the Sonic Spin, he could only work in closed arenas and couldn't nearly match Sonic's speed - making him easy fodder for Sonic to tear apart! When Robotnik created Metal Sonic, a sleeker and quicker version, the Silver Sonic project was abandoned and in its place came....

Defeat after defeat Robotnik wished that he could have some way to even the odds....After careful study of Sonic's anatomy, Dr. Robotnik created a perfect robot counterpart...logically called "Metal Sonic". Metal Sonic is the ONLY thing on Mobius (Robot or otherwise) that can actually MATCH Sonic's mindbending speed. He also has the ability to generate two types of electric shields around himself, both of which are capable of giving any outside receivers a painful shock. The first encounter between Sonic and Metal Sonic took place on the Little Planet...Robotnik unleashed the pseudo-Sonic to kidnap Amy Rose and keep the real Sonic busy...the whole while the Eggman was collecting the Time Stones. What Robotnik doesn't know however, is that when he scanned Sonic's biological data, Metal Sonic also obtained Sonic's feelings. He is still controlled by his programming, but something inside of him strives to break free. Maybe one day it will...So much so infact that Metal Sonic can turn himself into "Super Metal Sonic" just like his counterpart when he absorbs enough chaos energy. Metal Sonic even has his own slick & sleek racecar he calls the Blue Devil. He used it in the second Chaos Grand Prix. It's Super Dash ability puts the Cyclone's Dash to shame.

With the Metal Sonic on his side, Robotnik was a step closer to beating Sonic - with him he had come close MANY a time. But soon another spoiler was added to the mix - Knuckles The Echidna! As Sonic battled Robotnik within the Death Egg, Knux remained in the Sky Sanctuary Zone to save his homeland once and for all by the threat Robotnik left - Metal Sonic - who had now gone super thanks to the powers of the Master Emerald! It was through a great fight that Knux beat him and after the massive defeat of the Death Egg - as Robotnik licked his wounds he began to wonder WHAT could help him now that Sonic had another ally? His answer came in the form of "Metal Knuckles". Just as Metal Sonic was created as a perfect robot counterpart to Sonic, Dr. Robotnik created Metal Knuckles by scanning the guardian's own biological data. Metal Knuckles retains all of Knuckles' abilities enhanced to the max. His virtually endless and smooth glide puts the echidna's to shame. However, also like Metal Sonic, Metal Knuckles obtained Knuckles' personality when the echidna's biological data was scanned. Although he is still controlled by his programming, something inside strives to break free. Maybe one day it will... </blockquote>

Again - during the battle with Sonic 3, Robotnik happened to notice something. Tails The Fox had also been an ally to the hedgehog long before Knuckles had ever entered the picture...Botnik had come to the conclusion that EVEN IF he had the Metal Sonic and now Metal Knuckles on his side he would still lack that competetive edge...So why not a Metal Tails? It would work BUT Robotnik had a better plan....And that plan served in the creation of his strangest and most frightening expiriment - "The Tails Doll"....Tails Doll is a mysterious creation. He wasn't made using the same biodata-scanning technique that was used for Metal Sonic and Metal Knuckles. No one knows exactly what Robotnik's up to, but Tails Doll appears to be a stuffed toy with an odd red jewel dangling out of its forehead. Not only that BUT Tails Doll has no distinguishable personality, but just floats lifelessly most of the time, like a weightless zombie. His hover technology is unique, because he is not being held up by any visible rocket boosters, like most flying Badniks nordoes he rotate his twin tails like his counterpart. It's suspected that Robotnik is experimenting with frightening new technology, and Tails Doll is only a test... </blockquote>

Every Rogue's Gallery needs its wild card and nack fits the bill exceptionally !!!! Nack holds the "honor" of being despised by EVERYBODY from Sonic and Knuckles to Doctor Robotnik !!! Nack is VERY known to double cross ANYONE in his path and would stab his own mother in the back for a profit! Also known as Fang the Sniper, Nack the Weasel is a freelancing bounty and treasure hunter who will work for whichever side pays him more, but most often he'll just be working for himself. He knows every trick in the book, and a few that aren't. He gets around using a speedy little airbike called the Marvelous Queen (which he used for the second Chaos Grand Prix racing tournament), but he can also leap to lofty heights using his long tail like a spring. Like Sonic and Robotnik, he's got his eye on those shiny stones the Chaos Emeralds; but unlike Sonic and Robotnik he doesn't want 'em for the ensuing power...his goal is to sell them on the Mobian Black Market for the highest bidder!</p>

Sonic may have his Rougue's Gallery but Tails is NOT without his as well!!!! The Battle Bird Armada may not be as strong as The Badnik Army but they DEFINETELY hold nothing but contempt and hatred for a certain two-tailed fox!!! It all began when Sonic and Tails temporarily parted for a little vacation time, and Tails decided to visit his favorite getaway spot - a little island he discovered, and named after himself: Tails Island! Problem is, there wasn't much relaxing as tails came face to face with the heavily-armed bird army that swept through and wrought terror on the island! The inhabitants of the isle were in panic, and the woods were suddenly ablaze! Armed with nothing but a small arsenal of bombs located inside his submarine - The Sea Fox - Tails defeated the army and its leader - an evil fat bird that bears a striking resemblance to Bean the Duck - possibly a relation. But it came with a price as Tails was marked by the army that someday vowed revenge! Basically the Battle Birds do not seek to conquer like Robotnik, but instead loot and plunder like a band of pirates wherever they come upon next. And with little to no regard for any of the life in which they attack it makes them JUST as dangerous as Robotnik.....</p>

Dr. Robotnik is by far the most EVIL of all Sonic villians- but Perfect Chaos is THE MOST POWERFUL....Dr. Robotnik discovered the immense power the Chaos Emeralds while excavating to make a secret underground laboratory far after his most recent defeats. It was at the excavation site that he stumbled across some ancient drawings. The long-buried illustrations revealed the true power of the Chaos Emeralds, previously known only to civilizations that time has long since forgotten. But with his previous defeats what could be SO POWERFUL as to stop Sonic in his tracks FOREVER? A weapon even more powerful than the blue blur himself. Carefully aware that all of his previous mechanical creations have failed, Robotnik tried a new strategy: Perfect Chaos!!!! The Perfect Chaos, as it is called, is a liquid monster with the ability to change shape to suit any situation. The water beast literally feeds on the power of the Chaos Emeralds, and constantly grows in strength. It is even solely responsible for wiping out an entire civilization thousands of years ago, and it's in these ruins that Robotnik digs the living fluid up....With Perfect Chaos under his control, Dr. Eggman plans to use the beast to take over a large city to create the supreme home base: Eggman Land.....

They are the death machines - The new lines of "Super Badniks" thats sole purpose is to do one thing - ERADICATE Sonic The Hedgehog at all costs! Armed to the teeth with an arsenal that could level Cleveland, they have no qualms about killing the hedgehog on sight. It looks like Doc Robotnik has finally created the perfect war machines.....Little does he know that the second in the series, E-102, had a slight glitch....

A principal villian for Amy Rose - this swatbot stalks her from the very beginning of her part in the great Sonic Adventure, and is hellbent on eradicating it's target. However, Zero - no matter how powerful he is - is also slow in his attacks and has flaw in his design - namely a vulnerability to electricity...
