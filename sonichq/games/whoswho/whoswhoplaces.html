Every Hero and Villian has a place that they can call home - for the cast of Sonic The Hedgehog there is no home better known than Planet Mobius. Its location in the solar system is unknown but theres no doubt of the eerie parralels it has to Planet Earth. Maybe its just a coincidence. Maybe not...Either way Mobius holds MANY secrets. Another special thing about the planet is that along with the natural elements of earth, water, wind, and fire it has two more that can be QUITE resourceful - Chaos Emeralds (A large source of powerful unknown energy held inside an emerald) and Power Rings (Magic rings that enhance the abilities of whoever possesses them). It is these two baubles that Sonic uses in his near neverending quest to stop Robotnik. And it is these two baubles that the Eggman wants to use to turn the planet into a veritable wasteland of factories and roboticised animals....

South Island holds GREAT IMPORTANCE as its the location of the famous Green Hill Zone where Sonic began his first battle with Robotnik. South Island is considered Sonic's secret "Getaway" spot and he's VERY adamant about intruders invading its territory - One such incident was when Robotnik tested out his new chaos emerald and roboticised the entire Green Hill Zone turning it into the Mecha Green Hill Zone (<i>Sonic And Tails/Sonic Chaos</i>) that was the closest Eggman ever got to fulfilling his evil dreams. But you can rest assured that while the Eggman's sights are beginning to lay on Mobius as a whole - he has NOT forgotten about South Island. And neither will Sonic....

To say the Special Zone follows one specific pattern is not true. The Special Zone is NEVER the same thing from when it was before - always changing always moving. Reality holds NO FORM here! One thing IS a constant in this zone however: No matter what the change in structure of the zone, Chaos Emeralds And Power Rings can ALWAYS be found here in LARGE ABUNDANCE!!!!! There are two known ways to get into the special zone - Through mysterious "Starpost Warp Rings" that materialize and are put in view ONLY when you have 50 rings OR through Dimensional Rings - Giant Power Ring like objects that transport whoever steps into it into the zone...for right now ONLY Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails know how to enter this "Zone Of Mystery" but it is well known that SOMEHOW Flicky Birds are able to sneak in as well. So much so that they can be called upon by weapons as Tails in his "Super Tails" form. What is the mystery behingd the zones? Is it the large amounts of Chaos Emeralds that lay in its wake? The HUGE abundance of Power Rings? Mobius has YET to know...</p></b>

</blockquote><p align><b> "On the last month of every year, the Little Planet appears over Never Lake." It was known in only legends and stories - "A World that Defied Time Itself" - It is called The Little Planet and its connection with Amy Rose is even stranger...The tiny world that orbits around Mobius holds the the special "Time Stones" that alter time and change everything around them! Its even said that the planet's full of places that are completely ignored by the passage of time! It was on such a day long after Sonic's first bout with Doctor Robotnik - that he had young Amy Rose following hot on his heels! When they arrived at Never Lake, the Little Planet was there as expected.  But something was wrong.  Where there should have been tall trees and bright flowers, there was nothing but dry sand and jagged rocks.  The Little Planet was tethered to a rock with a huge chain, and its surface was covered with twisted, gleaming metal. And while Amy pondered over the situation, before Sonic could reply, something whooshed over them. Amy shrieked as she was snatched up, and she and her captor vanished in a blue streak of light! </p>


<p>It didn't take long for Sonic to realize what had happened as well as WHO was behind it! Robotnik had not been seen for a while since his first bout with the hedgehog but it was PAINFULLY obvious with what he was up to! Upon discovering the location of the Little Planet, the evil Eggman and his badnik Army had immediately set about converting it to a Giant Floating Fortress - Robotnik's ULTIMATE SUBBASE!!!  And as Robotnik saw Sonic approaching, via the chain tether, he had laughed triumphantly. He had learned from his previous assault the hedgehog could NOT be defeated by just himself alone! So dispatched his prize creation, the "Metal Sonic", to grab Amy and lure his archenemy into danger!!! "How convenient!" Robotnik crowed, bouncing about like a malicious rubber ball. This time his plan was sure NOT to fail as this time he had his OWN Sonic plus TIME ITESLF on his side! Once all the Time Stones were in his hands, he'd be able to completely manipulate time and conquer Mobius in ONE FELL SWOOP!!! Sonic stood on a rock and thought. Robotnik had total control of the Little Planet. He had Amy, and soon he would have the Time Stones...but not if Sonic got to them first! His adventure on the Little Planet was going to be more exciting and dangerous than he'd planned....Especially since waiting in the wings, was his "twin brother" the malicious Metal Sonic, hellbent on destroying his other....</b>

Its possibly one of the most famous zones next to Casino Night for MANY reasons - one of those being that its the place where Sonic finally comes face to ugly face with his evil twin !!! Amy being kidnapped is just ONE problem. The battle with Metal Sonic is another! Located just before Metallic Madness - Robotniks headquarters on The Little Planet - the Stardust Speedway sits as the ONLY entrance to the metal zone. Speed is the key which Sonic can handle, BUT Metal Sonic has other things in mind. But what makes this zone so darn famous? The memorable race between Sonic and Metal Sonic where the rules are race or die! And it is just SHEER FUN to play! In the end Sonic wins but only at the cost of Metal Sonic's complete accidental electrocution due to The Eggman!

Mount Mobius is known for being an active volcano BUT things just got a WHOLE LOT HOTTER....It is here that Robotnik decided to up the ante - his creation: The largest single roboticiser known to man! A special project that he called: "The Machine"....taking his prisoners captive - it was here that they were sent to become full fledged slaves of The Eggman! And to make make matters worse Robotnik decided it would be here that he'd make his ULTIMATE test. Noticing other trouble ares that Sonic had in previous zones like Casino Night City, Spring Yard, and Collision Chaos it was here that he decided he would finally destroy Sonic for all with his new - Pinball Defense System ! With Sonic bouncing around inside Mount Mobius like a hyperkinetic cork there would be no way he could have time to stop Eggman perform roboticisation on his prisoners! Sonic and Tails found out about it late but you can rest assured they were already on thier way to intercepting Robotnik ! HOWEVER on thier way there Tails' biplane was shot and Sonic lost his footing and plummeted into the ocean below....He soon emerged in the Toxic Caves deep below the surface of Mount Mobius, and realising that the fortress was BIGGER than he thought he was forced to make his way upward - his goal: Disable the Chaos Emerald power system, shut down the Lava Powerhouse fueling area, Destroy "The Machine" roboticiser, and prepare for the final showdown with Doctor Robotnik....</p></b>

</blockquote><p align><b>At the end of <i>Sonic The Hedgehog 1</i> the final battle between Sonic and the Eggman took place in Robotnik's central headquarters - a giant egg shaped building called The Scrap Brain Zone. But while The Scrap Brain serves as central command, we learn in <i>Sonic 2</i> that there's more to Robotnik's super citadel than we thought. The Scrap Brain is only ONE PART of the HUGE twising complex of factories, gears, roboticisers and deadly robotic traps that is called...."The Metropolis Zone". Known by some as "Robotropolis", this serves as Robotnik's death base to the world. A twisting heaving mass that stands as a testament to all the destruction he can impose if he is let loose on the planet. While this does serve as his MAIN base of operations - Robotnik does have several other places and areas all over Mobius that he can get around in as well. The Metropolis Zone is evil enough in its looks but it is here that Robotnik spawned one of his greatest and most DEADLY creations....

</blockquote><p align><b> Possibly one of Robotnik's greatest and most EVIL inventions, The Death Egg is more than just a "second homebase"! Spawned in the bowels of The Metropolis Zone, The Robotnik Death Egg serves as a gleaming sprawl of buttons and wires. It is literally a "Minuature Planet" !!!! With the image of the Eggman's moustached pallet sprawled across its face The Death Egg is Robotniks greatest twisted wish come to fruition - An item that can roboticise all of Planet Mobius with the single push of a button....It was the object that Sonic had his sights set on at the end of <i>Sonic 2</i>. Already fueled and ready for take off, Sonic infiltrated Robotnik's first airship - The Wing Fortress to try and stop him just before he could get the chance to FULLY activate it. In the end Sonic managed to fully totall the Fortress but Robotnik escaped just in time as the Death Egg was launched into Mobius' Orbit through launch bases of the Metropolis Zone!! But Sonic was far from over - NO MATTER WHAT Robotnik could not succeed! Tails, taking his biplane, piloted Sonic JUST close enough so that he could hang onto one of the rocket boosters and as Robotniks getaway pod docked into the hangars of the Death Egg, Sonic snuck away to confront his  arch-enemy once and for all. After making quick work of The Silver Sonic Prototype, Sonic then ventured into Robotniks' huge arena where he battled Robotnik in his ultimate battlesuit - The Eggsterminator !!!</p>

<p>After a LONG battle Sonic destroyed the suit - BUT there was one problem...The Death Egg was not yet at full power and The Eggsterminator's explosions set off a chain reaction on the ship! Sonic did all he could do to speed out and go into freefall as Tails and the gang below watched The Death Egg seemingly blow into a million pieces!!! Tails rescued Sonic from freefall via the biplane, both thinking Robotnik was finally gone but as they cruised the ocens towards home they saw something that made thier hearts drop - The Death Egg was NOT destroyed and from the looks of things it had seemingly crash landed on "an island in the sky". And as the island slowly fell from the heavens Sonic and Tails turned around unaware of just WHAT the Death Egg had landed on....and WHO would be waiting for them !</p></b>

Over the many years that mantle passed from generation to generation like royalty until it came to the head of Knuckles The Echidna.

Well Knuckles knows, and Robotnik discovered it by accident when he was with him before....The power fuel comes from none other than The Chaos Rings and The Power Gems !! And Robotnik planned to use that power to its FULLEST extent! From the Techno Tower Zone everything on Carnival island can be controlled! And it was here that Robotnik grabbed his grasp and began his plan to get that power as soon as possible! Knuckles knew VERY well that the items were hidden from Robotnik's grasp. But after his bout with him before with the Death Egg he knew THAT wouldn't stop him!

After the fiasco with the Death Egg and getting trounced by Knuckles on Carnival Island Robotnik decided to go for it again but whereas his previous incarnations were known, this time he decided to be quiet and make his Flicky Island Base in secret! And what did he build while there - he was CLOSE to completeing his latest inventions: "The Panic Puppet" and "The Dimension Ring Generator !!!" And while the LARGE Panic Puppet Zone would serve as his base of operations he was steadily awork on a small one that would serve as his newest ultimate battlesuit just in case a certain pesky hedgehog manged to arrive....And what about the generator? For years the Flickies had done what NO ONE ELSE on Mobius except maybe Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails had known how to do - gain access to the special zone! They could even be called upon by Tails when he turned into "Hyper Tails" showing just how much chaos enrgy they have. The trick is - how did they do it? Dimensional Rings! And after studying the Flickies, Robotnik knew just how to capture them and how to use the rings to his own good....Soon he could travel into the Special Zone and collect the emeralds - and come out wreaking MUCH havoc !!</p>

Though this has never been stated officially by Sega it is ASSUMABLE by very good reason that it was this island that holds the home to the Chaos Grand Prix (<i>Sonic Drift 1 And 2</i>) as it OFFICIALLY held The Sonic Racing Tournament that was sponsored by the Eggman in <i>Sonic R</i>.</p>

<p>Resort Island is a luxury paradise centered on one of Mobius' greatest pasttimes - racing! Basically its an island that serves as fun place to just get away from it all ! And you know that Robotnik has tried to get his grubby paws on it MORE than once...But the rules HERE differ - How? Because the rules on Resort Island go by one simple word - RACE !  Chaos Emeralds aren't as abundant here as everywhere else BUT if you race for them and make first place youre BOUND to get one sooner or later.
