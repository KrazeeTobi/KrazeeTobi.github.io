<p><b>
Faster than a speeding bullet - it's "Sonic the Hedgehog" and when he isn't rearranging the landscape with "little brother" Tails, he can probably be found on his hideaway base of South Island. An excellent athlete, Sonic has been known to clock speeds faster than Mach 1 - not only that, but he's a highly skilled acrobat as well....His arsenal of moves include the Sonic Spin which can buzz through the thickest underground passageways, and his Double Jump in which he goes SO FAST he can literally "jump on air itself". The Spin Dash, Super Peel Out, and Strike Dash are three different ways of utilizing his techniques - not only that but he has learned to completely manipulate such items as flame shields - in a fireball dash attack, excel even higher on a "Super Double Jump" with an energy shield, and do a "Super sonic leap" with a Bubble Shield.</p>

<p>Although racing isn't particularly Sonic's interest, he does have a sleek red racecar he calls the Cyclone which he has used in two of the Chaos Grand Prix tournaments. When Sonic collects all seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Sonic!!! As Super Sonic, all of his natural abilities are enhanced and his speed is so incredible that he actually hovers a few feet above the ground rather than running on it! He is completely invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning). His color also changes from brilliant blue to shining yellow. However, he needs at least fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back to normal Sonic!!!

Miles Prower has never been just an ordinary kid...He was born with 2 tails, and for most of his life he had been made fun of and teased by the other kids about it. Not only that but he's an orphan as well - abandoned by his parentsthere was no one he felt he could turn to with his problems. That is - UNTIL Sonic showed up. Sonic helped Tails turn his "burden" into his greatest asset by teaching him to use his twin tails in flight. Propelling him to speeds ALMOST as fast as Sonic. By whirling his tails together like a helicopter, he can fly for short periods of time, as well as propel himself along the ground...fast enough to keep up with his spiny blue hero! Aside from his standard flying maneuver, Tails is also an expert swimmer, and has learned how to use his tails to attack with a special Propeller Dash move. Tails' goal in life is to be just like his hero and best friend, Sonic the Hedgehog...living the life of an adventurer. What became of his parents is unknown, but he and Sonic bonded like glue from the moment they first met....</p>

<p>Tails is very wise for his age and its shown in his hobbies - as he owns a red bi-plane, known as the "Tornado", which comes complete with attached rocket boosters and jet flight skill! With Tails piloting and Sonic riding on the wings, they can clear oceans and mountain ranges in half the time it would take them on foot. Tails also has a small racecar called the Whirlwind S7, which he used for both Chaos Grand Prix tournaments. It's max speed isn't very high, but it's light enough to "jump" into the air without much force. When Tails collects all seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Tails. As Super Tails, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is also invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning), and glows a bright orange-yellow color. Four Super Flicky birds come to his aid, destroying every Badnik in sight and clearing a path for him. However, he needs at least fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back to normal Tails.

<BR><b>Quote:</b> "Born on an island in the heavens, the blood of my ancestors flows inside me. My duty is to guard the Master Emerald."

</center>

 <p><b>
Knuckles the Echidna is the last of a lost civilization of echidnas that flourished a over a century ago. This society mysteriously disappeared, and left many secrets and mystical powers in its wake - including that of: The Master Emerald - The LARGEST Chaos Emerald in existence. As the last living descendant of the civilization, it is Knuckles' sworn duty to protect Floating Island, all animals on it and the Master Emerald which keeps it afloat. When someone or something threatens the island, this feisty echidna's on the case! 
When the land is peaceful, however, Knuckles enjoys lounging around as much as Sonic does. He also knows all of the Floating Island's secret passageways and shortcuts, though, so even a little slacking off won't reduce his reaction time. Knuckles receives aid in his duty as guardian from the Chaotix: Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee. It was with their help that Knuckles was able to stop Dr. Robotnik's plan to steal the Power Emerald (which fuels Carnival Island) and save the six Chaos Rings that serve as its power source. </p>

<p>Occasionally - if time permits, he'll go down to the surface for a SMALL amount of fun. Knuckles has his own speedy little racecar known as the Tempest. This orange, jeep-like vehicle helped the echidna through the second Chaos Grand Prix tournament, and (like Tails' Whirlwind S7) is light enough to "jump" into the air with little force. When Knuckles collects all seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Knuckles. As Super Knuckles, all of his natural abilities are enhanced. He is also invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed and drowning), and glows a flashing pink color. However, he needs to have atleast fifty Rings to utilize Chaos Emerald power, and he must keep a steady supply or he'll turn back into normal Knuckles.

Amy Rose, the young hedgehog with a hopeless crush on Sonic! Sonic could do without her, but once she's got a hug in edgewise, there's no shaking her off...Little Amy is more than just an annoyance, though. She has links to the Little Planet, and can predict its future with tarot cards. She's also mastered the Heart Attack, a charm move that confuses its receiver into a mindless daze. She has few redeeming hand-to-hand combat qualities, but her Magical Hammer can easily pound a few braincells out of any opponents with just a light swing. It's this colorful, oversized mallet that she used to hold her own in the Sonic Championship fighting tournament. Her "Pico Pico Hammer Attack" also keeps her path clear in Sonic Adventure. 
Amy also has two small cars that she uses for travel. The Breeze is a small blue car that almost seems to have a mind and face of its own. It's the one she used for both of the Chaos Grand Prix tournaments. She's also got a red convertible, which she used in the World Grand Prix. It's lifeless and a little on the slow side, but it comes equipped with an automatic hover engine and a Turbo Boost!

<p><b>
Mighty The Armadillo is possibly the strongest of the Sonic cast seeing as how his strength is not that of a normal furry. He's very smart but often tends to jump into many situations without thinking.

<p>Mighty may be most known as one of the memebers of the Chaotix but he also shares a bond with Sonic as it was him, another associate by the name of Ray The Squirrel, and Sonic that thwarted a plan of Robotnik years before Sonic had met Knuckles. He's an old friend of Knuckles, and joined up with the Chaotix when Robotnik threatened Carnival Island and the Chaos Rings.

<p>He can jump up the steepest of walls with ease, and when he kicks-off, he can take even the most wary of Badniks by surprise. He can also accelerate top great speed by kicking off a wall and hitting the ground running.

Vector may have a BIG mouth but that nothing compared to the size of his heart. Brash and brazen yet carefree and happy-go-lucky, Vector never lets a serious situation get in the way of a good time (or his favorite song). This cool croc is NEVER without his headset, even in the most dire of battles. 

<p>If there's anything Vector loves as much as music, it's eating and speeding. He loves the rush of running when he isn't jammin' with his friends or investigating the local food courts. It's not yet known exactly how Vector got hooked up with the Chaotix...

<p>When Vector does a spin attack or spin dash, he rolls himself up into a ring shape. His Power Boost move works like a jump or spin-dash within a jump, giving this cool croc some extra height or some quick acceleration. He can also scale walls almost as fast as Knuckles.

Espio is quick and strong, and loves freedom.  He has an intense drive in everything he does - when he runs, he charges head-first and doesn't look back.  His hot temper often leads him into rough situations, and his friend Charmy Bee sometimes has to remind him of his manners. 

<p>Espio values his freedom above all else, and holds a grudge against Robotnik for trapping him in the Combi Confiner several years ago. It was when Knuckles rescued him from the machine that Espio joined the Chaotix, and vowed to protect the island alongside Knuckles at all costs. 

Espio's lashing Tongue Attack can whip the hardest of Badniks into shape, and his whirling attack - a tornado version of the standard spin - can leave any opponents spinning their heads! His unique ability to run along walls and ceilings can get him out of any tight spots, and he can also change his color at will to blend into the scenery.

Charmy Bee is the most sophisticated of the Chaotix...this guy knows his P's and Q's! Infact, he's often the one who has to keep Espio in line. Charmy flew to Floating Island several years ago in search of new types of flowers. It was there he met Knuckles and joined the Chaotix. Only he can handle tricky problems in such a cool and charming way, making him an invaluable member of the team. Charmy's small size and light weight make him a difficult target, which is compounded by his ability to fly out of any danger. Not only that - BUT his diminutive size makes for him being able to get into many places unnoticed. His unique Buzz-dash can tear right through the most powerful of Badniks with relative ease; and using Ring Power, this little honey bee is even strong enough to lift his friends into the air with him.

<p>Robotnik's former chief Mechanix, Heavy and Bomb defected during Robotnik's attempt to take over Carnival Island.  Heavy is very calm, and sincerely wants to help - perhaps wanting to make up for his past assistance to Robotnik.

<p>Although Heavy is very slow, he makes up for it with his incredible durability.  It's literally impossible for him to take a hit or lose rings.  He doesn't need to spin, either - he automatically damages enemies on contact.  Unfortunately, he basically has to be pulled through the zones by someone faster, and it's hard for that person to stop once Heavy starts moving forward.  By using linked rings, Heavy can act as a "ball and chain" - he'll slow down his companion, but the 2 of them will make a formidable opponent for Robotnik.</p>

<p>Robotnik's former chief Mechanix, Heavy and Bomb defected during Robotnik's attempt to take over Carnival Island. Bomb isn't really a fighter, but he is determined to help and puts his full effort into it. He is rather cautious, which is understandable, since he has a tendency to explode.

<p>Although slow by Sonic character standards, Bomb is faster and much lighter than Heavy. He can explode, and then quickly repair himself.  Unfortunately, this mechanism is set off if he takes a hit, and it can be very dangerous for any companion that is in range of the explosion.</p>

When it comes to bombs and explosives Bean is a certified genius - but when it comes to brains....well lets just say he's in need of some SERIOUS therapy....But what do you expect when most of your life consists of getting blown up? Bean is a bomb-crazed duck with a certain wild streak that far too often gets him into more trouble than it's worth. He's VERY unpredictable and you never know what this bird might do next...Never one to fear the consequences of his actions, Bean jumped on the opportunity to enter the Sonic Championship tournament. When he's too weak to negotiate, his endless supply of explosives will do the talking for him...Bean however has his roots in many other Sega games and it's rumored that Bean is related to the two somewhat quieter ducks, Bin and Pin. Bin and Pin - along with a human comrade named Suoy, haven't been seen for years...(Bin, Pin, and Suoy first appeared in the 1988 Sega arcade game, <i>Dynamite Dux</i>.) What happened to them - along with thier relationship to Bean still remains a mystery.....

So just whats the deal on Ray The Squirrel? At the moment nearly EVERYTHING about him is unknown. It IS KNOWN however that Ray was an integral part of Sonic Arcade - which also introduced Mighty The Armadillo. In that game, Ray was one of the the guys - along with Sonic and Mighty - that helped to defeat Doctor Robotnik. From what we have seen of him in pics and screenshots, Ray has been said to be quick on his feet, an almost "acrobatic-like character" that has limited flight/gliding ability! This was the only info provided for the longest time...Currently Sega Of America has provided Archie Comics with a bio of the character and he will finally make his American debut in the pages of the Sonic comic later this year as an added member of the Chaotix - Knuckles' group of friends on the Floating Isle.  This will be the only OFFICIAL info on him as it will be provided to Archie by Sega Of America. More info will be posted here until we find out...Stay tuned</p>
