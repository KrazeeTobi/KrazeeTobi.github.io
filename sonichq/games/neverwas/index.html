<p align><b>Video games are a lot like socks, in that they tend to disappear quite frequently and it may take months for you to notice they're gone. Between the way game news comes and goes among Sonic fandom, forthcoming Sonic games or ideas are announced and already announced games are updated with great regularity. But if a developer cancels a game and you miss the relative news story, you may not realize the title's been dumped until you try to buy it two months later and catch odd looks from the retail staff at Toys R Us. That's what this section is dedicated to - the Sonic games and ideas that you may NEVER see or that have been held in the smaller corner of Sonic fandom... 
</p>

<p align><b>You've seen the games. You've seen the way to play them and you've seen all the characters....or have you? Welcome to the "Hedgehog The Never Was" section of Sonic HQ ! For your eyes only we present the Sonic games that DIDN'T go into production, characters that never made it into the Sonic mythos, The Sonic 2 Beta, Sonic X-Treme, The elusive hacks that let you operate Super Mario in "Sonic 1", Sonic on the Super Nintendo, Sonic The Hedgehog 4: AKA Sonic Crackers, and the list goes on and on...

<b><center><p>The Sonic Graveyard is a chronicle of, or rather a digitized resting place for, info on those Sonic games or aspects of Sonic gaming that were for one reason or another, nipped in the bud or otherwise. Also here are the hacks, images, and any other type of information we can provide you with! This feature Will strive to be extensive; however, it's not without omission. Don't doubt for a minute that there aren't games that were merely a gleam in developers' eyes - and even some 60 percent builds - that the press never caught wind of. So with that in mind, if you have info about a game that was canceled, or if you worked on a canceled game or have more info about the titles we've listed here, <a href="mailto:Freddyg@sprynet.com ">e-mail us</a>, as we plan to hopefully update and expand this feature. Now on to the show! 

<p>This info came from <a href=mailto:JediYeerk@aol.com>JediYeerk</a> - It urns out that some freelance programmers in Asia managed to create a GameBoy version of Sonic 3D Blast!  Click <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011206000000/http://gameboy.s-one.net.sg/didknow014.htm>here</a> to see a pic.

<TD>Sonic 1 - in development for nearly a year and a half - was not without its share of issues. Did you know that the giant checker wrecker ball that Eggman uses was originally a hazard obstacle in the Green Hill Zone? What about the Clockwork and Sparkling zones? Check this out to see what the original concepts for Sonic 1 would have looked like - without all of its changes...

<H4><A HREF=s2.html>Sonic 2 - The Beta Backlash</A></H4>

<TD>The Genocide City Zone? The Wood Zone? The infamous Hidden Palace and Dust Hill? Probably our biggest section next to Sonic X-Treme, the Sonic 2 beta was let loose upon Sonic fandom a few months ago and now its added a whole new look on one of Sonic's greatest games...Check this section out to learn about what was probably some of the biggest changes in a Sonic game from a completely different Casino Night layout...
