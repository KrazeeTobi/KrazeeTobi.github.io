<b><a href="http://www.sonichq.org/general/">General Info</a></b> - Heya!  This is Pepperidge updating here.  If you don't know, I'm the unfortunate shmo stuck with the job of writing and maintaining the Games section of the Sonic Encyclopedia.  It certainly is far from an easy task.  But, in honor of the release of Sonic Adventure 2 (even though I haven't gotten it yet >_<), I decided to upload a few more profiles for Fang the Sniper, E-102 "Gamma" and Tikal.  Not only that, but I've also uploaded three new location profiles: South Island, Westside Island, and Angel Island.  And before the end of the week, I'll have some new pictures up too!  If you have any questions about the games portion of the encyclopedia, feel free to e-mail me at pepperidge@hotmail.com.  Thanks!<p>

<b><a href=http://www.dreamteamzone.org/satam/episod13.ram>Episode Of The Day!</a></b> - Because I like the idea so much, I've decided to keep the "Episodes Of The Day" going! ^___^ And what better way to start it off than with the very first episode of Sonic SatAM - the Saturday Morning ABC Sonic series!<br><br><p>Todays episode is the pilot, titled "Heads Or Tails". On a raid in Robotropolis to retrieve metal cotter pins, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday along with the rest of Mobotropolis. The Freedom Fighters also have to contend with a squadron of Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing Knothole. This is undoubtedly the debut episode as it was designed to attract the readers of the (then) new comic book, complete with the Pink Sally and a skinnier Rotor. In fact, All characters look as they did in the early comic days, even with Sally's original hairdo. The episode plays for the slapstick of the early comics all the way as well. Today's episode - "Heads Or Tails!" Be here for Episode 2 tomorrow! ^__^<br><p>

Continuing from the cliffhanger conclusion of yesterdays episode, Knuckles has a tough choice to make! It's either betraying his friends to Doctor Robotnik to save the planet, or find another way to contain the chaos thats quickly ripping Mobius to shreds! The answer is in short comings though, as the once harmless henchman Dingo absorbs the chaos energy and becomes a mutated monster on his way to destroy Robotropolis and the world!

Its supremo late (or rather EARLY depending on how you look at it) and before I hit the sack, I thought I'd update the Episode of The Day! ^__^<br><br><p>Today we present the second half of the Chaos Emerald Saga "No Hedgehog Is An Island". This episode is important in a LOT of ways. Both fans of the comic and of Knuckles in general will want to see it, as its starts a primary "Knuckles themed" episode. It also introduces to us for the first time, Grandfather Athair! But this Athair is VERY VERY VERY different from the Athair you know in the Archie comics...Chaos has broken out all over the planet as Dingo accidentally drops the Chaos Emerald and cracks it! Now the triplets, teamed up with Knuckles, must seek out Knux's great grandfather, Athair, the echidna sage, and the only person on Planet Mobius that knows how to contain the chaos energy, before the whole planet is destroyed...! <br><br><p>Todays episode - "The Chaos Emerald Saga: Part Two - No Hedgehog Is An Island". See you tomorrow for the conclusion of this episode and SU Week!<p>

<b><a href=fanfair/edited>SHQ Game Hoaxes</a></b> - <p>**Incoming Transmission**<br><br><p>Lectran here - I've added alot of hoaxes...  Sorry to those who didn't get their hoaxes up soon.  I went on a *cough* vacation, then extended it, then extended the extention, and so on.  So most of the hoaxes are up now.  So you can now send hoaxes, and they should be put up within 48 hours.  Also, so every knows, I only accept hoaxes in GIF or JPEG format, and they can't be over one MB (megabyte, or 1000 KB).  And with that, start sending!<br><br><p>Lectran OUT.<p>

<b></b> - Alright, I'm so sorry for the lack of updates at Q & A on my part, but a lot of things came up recently (such as trips to that desolate state of Maine). I'm going to try to update at least one or two questions every update, which will be about every day. I won't be able to do it this weekend, however, because I'm going back up to that stupid northern state. See ya! <br><br>   Joey<p>

<b><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bsonichqcommunity>Sonic HQ Forums</a></b> - The forum system has been TOTALLY overhauled. Due to popular demand, the everyone.net system of posting is no more, and we now have EZboards which so far have gotten some pretty nice remarks! Included are the Mobius Forum, The Trading Post, The News and Editorials forum, The Role Players Guild, and the Carnival Island Fan Projects forum. Coming within the next week will be a Sonic videogames forum which I've been debating on and offhand. ^___^ We hope you like it - pop in and say hi! And NO, on this one you don't have to worry about registration. :O)<p>

<b><p><a href=news/news.htm>News</a></b> - Upon my return: The news page has been given a bit of a new touch - First of all, look there to find two new editorials as well as a new Editorial focus for the month of June on Sonic The Comic and Ken Penders/Ben Hurts Sonic Movie Proposal. Secondly - theres a large influx of new articles up worth chacking out, one of which is bound to please Nack the Weasel fans. ^__^ Finally for those of you that use the public news poster, the rules have been GROSSLY revised (something they long needed) and its imperative that you <b>all</b> read them. If you have any news that you need to post today, I ask you to refrain until tomorrow as I need to get a CGI quip worked out with Vector. Until then, have fun with the editorials and make sure you check it out!<p>
