<b><u><center>Sonic & Megaman HQ Community - Rules And Regulations</u></b>
<br>Modified As Of: Janurary 23, 2001</font>

<p><font face=arial size=-2>The Mobius Forum...the oldest and most treasured part of Sonic HQ, its the place of love, war, peace, hatred, friendship, flame, knowledge, news, nonsense, thinkers, debaters, intellectuals, bouncing rubber chickens, evil dictatorial madmen in capes, harmless kitty porn, knuckles fanatics, lemonade stands, and last but not least, Sonic. 

<p>Since its incepton back when Sonic HQ was ten times smaller, its blossomed into a full fledged "Sonic HQ Community" now residing on our EZBoards! Anyone thats been a poster here, either past or present, can tell you - WE CARE ABOUT OUR FORUM AND WE TAKE IT QUITE SERIOUSLY. And we don't like seeing it defaced, defamed or any other thing. So for the newbie, the flamer, and even that person that thinks that any old schmuck can come in a rule the place like its thiers, we've set up a few rules. All rules were designed and agreed upon by all the moderators. Each forum has its own sorta set, but the last bit is advice sprinkled in that we give to you all for posting. So read these and the "Things to know" before posting and we're sure you can fit in here just like everyone else. <img src=http://www.geocities.com/blackbat4/smilie/biggrin.gif>

<br>Any posts dealing with material that is lewd and outright near pornographic will be deleted. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. No one wants to hear you graphically describe your sexual fantasies with it or something weird like that. Keep it to yourself. Thats just nasty and intolerable. >:P The characters are <b><u>NOT REAL</u></b> and its also very rude and disrepsectful to others on the board who have to read that kind of stuff when looking for a valid post.

<br>Flames are not tolerated</u> nor is severe cursing at another or rude jerkish innuendo (i.e. coming in and acting like an ass :P). Though the majority of the forumers can be teens, try to remember to keep it at a PG level because we have kids who do post here. Feel free to debate, but don't get devolve the debate into mindless flame wars over game systems or different Sonic universes (the two biggest best examples of this are Amy/Sally Discussions gone wild and the PS2): 
<p><LI>When you do debate, try to use solid arguments instead of just acting as if it's true only because you said it or because you heard someone else say it. "I HATE AMY SHE'S A STUPID B*TCH!" is not an argument no matter what spin you put on it. :P However "I hate Amy because she can be such an airhead. Look at how..." is a valid argument. See the difference? <p><LI>_DO NOT_ post a super-flame with mad cursing and then afterwards say "Oh I was just kidding!". Thats annoying as all hell. Do it and try and see if you can kid yourself out of a warning. If you were "kidding" you wouldnt have spent the time to type such garbage in the first place, and no one wants to sift through your "moment of glory" to see you fly off the handle like a bat out of heck.
<p><LI>If a admin or mod feels that your post has gotten out of hand and could possibly start a flame or a flame war, he or she has every right to delete it. If someone does get out of hand and we havent caught it, tell an admin and let us handle it. You get two warnings - continue to do this, you will be asked to leave or given a temporary ban. Flame bait, flames or anything remotely resembling the like won't be tolerated on the board and will involve immediate deletion - no questions asked. 


<p>Lastly, we encourage intellectual, cool, or funny discussion on all boards. Feel free to debate others ideas and opinions if you disagree--but not the people expressing them. If you don't like someone: take it to email. <b>You can disagree with someone's opinion without resorting to petty insults to make your point.</b> Our forum is not a place for you to let loose grudges or point out what you don't like about someone else.

<br>Just because someone doesnt answer your post or if its skipped over doesnt always mean anyone didnt read it. We get a high volume of traffic and sometimes they can be moved down the board. Sometimes people may not reply because, quite frankly, they dont have anything to say. :P If you post frequently, or try to talk with the people and/or be friendly, the local forumers may be more responsive in replying to you.  Furthermore - if your post is nothing but pure spam, people are gonna skip over it regardless. :P As a bit of advice - try posting topics that others are interested in, dont post things that have already been said somewhere else (theres no need for 5 consectutive topics on Metal Sonic when another already exists and is still going) or try to make good conversation in already existing ones. Dont be afraid to say "I disagree" or add something new to the conversation. <u>BUT DO NOT</u> clutter the board with "WHY ISNT ANYONE RESPONDING TO ME YOU ALL DONT LIKE ME!!!!" and DO NOT overreact by saying you'll gouge your eyeballs out or slit your wrists, because nine times out of ten, stuff like that only makes people NOT want to respond and makes them more annoyed.

<br>This may sound brash, but if you're going to post at all, post something that worth discing and not stupid spam. There's a board SOLELY for site ads, a board specifically for testing your signatures, a Guestbook Extension and boards designed with specific topics in mind where you may get a better response. The Mobius Forum is our large general anything goes area, but ABOVE ALL there is NO general discussion on Station Square. That board is solely for news and/or news discussion, discussion of polls, editorials or editorial discussion, or debates on topics you and ohers created. "Sonic is cool" or "Archie sucks" is opinion, but it's not really discussion material unless you have something you or someone else can reitterate on it. Post WHY you think something, and be ready to discuss or prod discussion on it. Stuff like this clutters the board. And no one likes to wade through it. See the Spam List to the right. Posters who consistantly post spam will be asked to stop twice, then asked to leave or be temporarily banned.

<br>DO NOT ABUSE THE POLLS, DO NOT ABUSE THE SMILIES! Remember that half of the things you say can sometimes be said without a poll to do it. Try to use them if you want a general opinion on what a broad range of people think on a certain subject, otherwise dont bog down the board with them. Vapid polls along the lines of "SONIC IS BLUE! DO YOU LIKE IT! YESNO!" or "Why do you not like me?" will be <u>deleted on contact.</u> :P Concerning the smilies, dont place so many smilies in a post that you cant load it. :P And by that I mean like 50 lines worth of the same grinning circle. Not everyone has DSL thank you. :D

<br>This is a topic we're lenient on in some areas and not in others. But it needs to be in writing. If you're pissed off, its OK to let it out and curse if you wish. But <u>dont</u> curse like a drunken sailor on crack and NOT expect to be told to tone it down by an admin. Whether we see them or not, kids post here and if thier parents are doing thier jobs like thier supposed to, then they dont want thier kid reading "F**K YOU @SSH*LE!!!!!!!!" every five minutes and neither do a lot of other people. The EZBoard cursing sensors are on, but they dont delete @$$, hell, or sh*t because whether you think it vulgar or not, some people DO wish to talk without being censored and you have to compromise between the teens, kids, and adults in a place like this. 

<p>HOWEVER we WILL censor the over the top stuff (anything sexually related and/or just plain horribly obnoxiously vulgar). Constant incessant cursing and carrying on like a hot-and-bothered twit ALL THE TIME is definetely a no-no. Lastly, try to refrain from using the "b" word (female dog) as its very rude and disrespectful to the ladies of the forum. The best thing we can say is if youre going to use a curseword, do it in moderation out of respect for others, or better yet, try to keep it at PG. :)

<br>It doesnt matter how long a thread is, but what does matter is the main page only holds 25 threads before its moved to the next. Don't start a new thread addressed to only one person, unless it's something everyone can respond to or unless its urgently drastic. If you're going to be making a lot similar-subject posts (such as questions, a "quote or post of the week" or episodes of a story you're writing on the forum), make a favorite or bookmark of that thread and post the other posts as responses to it. A good example are Questions Of The Week or Random Thoughts or the Shadow Game. This will bring it to the top of the forum automatically and makes it easier to archive the forum and to find your similar posts when the post get too big. :)

<br>Overall use plain old common sense when posting. You'd be surprised how many people often dont. >;) Be open minded - a lot of people, from a lot of cultures, believe or do different things or have thier own quirks. You wouldnt expect someone from Britain to behave or understand some the cultures and quirks of all Americans (and vice versa). Dont be arrogant and think that your way is the only way that exists. If you have a question about other cultures or quirks from someone, feel free to ask it but dont belittle because of it. You may even learn something about others since we often have a broad range of people visit here from Malaysia, to Australia, to Great Britain, Canada, and America. Be tolerant - someones quirk that you dont like, may often be someone elses normal way of living and doing things. If that thing offends you, don't ram it down thier throat or attack that person but try and talk to them. Maybe that person can see your way of thinking or in turn try to compromise, so that way you both can agree. Be respectful - Respect others and thier beliefs. You'll get a lot more respect in return. 

<p>And lastly: <b>_HAVE FUN_</b>. We may be a little strict sometimes, but we want everyone who visits to have a good time, have fun and or just live life without fear of being maimed by a flamer or caught up petty arguments and spam. :) We have our ups, our downs, and our sideways. Instead of being down all the time, try to be up about it, after all this is a message board. The server or webpage does not make a board, its the people and the ATTITUDES that visit.

<P>Smilies (or emoticons) can be used to accent your conversation. :D But sometimes, the standard ones dont always convey that feeling you need. To remedy this, we've created the Smiley Repository, a list of over 100 smileys for the boards and how to use them in your posts. <u>Don't abuse the smilies though</u> (in other words flooding the board with them until your posts wont load) or we'll send the Smiley Police after you and give you a good thumping! ^__^ To see the full list of smileys available and directions, click here: <a href=http://www.sonichq.org/forum/smilie/smilie.html>The Smiley Repository</a>

<p>The admins arent here to be bullies or dictators, but rather try to keep everything in line and make sure the board doesnt fall headfirst into the flaming pits of internet hell. ^__^ If you disagree with something an administrator has done then try and talk to the admin and figure out if you two can solve the problem <u>peacefully</u> so you both can avoid it again - in other words dont come barging in like a ninny demanding someones head just cause your toes got stepped on :). That way you can avoid confrontation and everyone can be happy. ALL Admins reserve the right to delete or edit what they deem fit, HOWEVER no admin is allowed to abuse thier status or others. Board Moderators are chosen by how long you've been at the board, if youre a trustworthy and/or cool person and if the others agree to it. :)

Flaming someone, spamming/flooding the board continuosly, acting like you rule the boards, posting lewd sexually explicit material and/or just plain acting like an obnoxious unlikeable jerk will get you banned. Depending on the severity the ban can either be temporary or permanent, and we CAN ban by IP number. 

<p>If someone can vouch for you or if we feel the ban isnt bad, then it can be lifted. Otherwise it stays.

<img src=http://www.geocities.com/blackbat4/smilie/spam.gif align=left><img src=zeropic.gif  align=right>
<P>Blah blah Blah - Spam!!! In a place like the Mofo or the other boards, sometimes its hard to distinguish whats considered Spam for certain areas. What is Spam? Spam is anything that "clutters" the board needlessly and is either WAAAY off topic for that area or is just insanely vapid with no reason for it to have even been posted. For instance theres the good spam (authorized by the SPA ^__^) that can make you laugh out of your seat or bad spam thats just mad stupid and is posted for the simple fact of cluttering the vicinity. Either way - TOO MUCH of that bad spam can get on everyones nerves and can be subject to a deleted post if youre not careful. :P 
<br>
<br>We're not being anal, but here's some things that we and other posters consider "bad spam". Try to avoid it when posting:

<p><LI> One word and/or single sentence topics - "Do You like Sonic!" Well DUH! This is a Sonic messageboard. Messages with nothing more than "Sonic is cool! I like his spikes!" or just plain "Wow" are really fruitless topic wise - you know, topic that take little to no brain power and are just stupid can be really annoying after a while if you let them build up. Try to stay away from that.
<br><br><LI> Poll Abuse - <u>PLEASE DO NOT ABUSE THE POLLS !!!!</u> See the rule to the left for more expansion on it. But the polls are not meant for little stupid stuff like "Do you like me? YES NO!" and abuse of them will constitute as spam. Don't post a new poll everyday with nothing on it but "Are my shoes green? YES NO!" or "Do you like Segasonic? YESNO!" If theyd idnt like Sonic, they wouldnt be here. Remember - sometimes a simple comment can be said without the use of polling every minute thing in creation. ^_^ And before you poll - try and see if anyone else has asked that question previously. That way you can save space. :)
<br><br><LI> Smiley Abuse. Smilies rock ^__^ A million smilies that wont load do not. :) Use them to your hearts content - thats what they're there for, but dont get obnoxious with them. :D
<br><br><LI> Post Counts - Try to keep your post counts contained and dont scream everytime you reach a landmark. ^^ For example, its cool if you hit 200 or 500 or youre close to a thousand and wanna tell everyone! Thats no problem. :) But we dont need to an announcement every 25 posts or banners that you hit 62 or or -3 or 616 or 796.8999999.... :P
<br><br><LI> Try to stay on topic for the board youre on - Look at the board you're at. If you're posting on the Segasonic board, we dont need to know everything about the characters in Archie Sonic. Or if you're at Knothole Village, you're certainly not going to talk about STC or vice versa. This <u>ESPECIALLY</u> goes for Station Square which is solely a news and editorials (or discussion on said editorials) board: NOT GENERAL DISCUSSION. 

<p>Overall, remember to use common sense when you post. :) Try to keep your topics interesting and something that everyone can participate in. Encourage discussion rather than discourage it.

<img src=rollpic.gif  align=right>
<P> So you make a post and next thing you know - it vanishes!

<p>Check the rules. Did you break one? Did your post fall under anything in the Spam List? Or maybe one of the admins felt that your post was better suited in another forum and it was just moved. Before you scream bloody murder, if there was another dominant topic, check to see if it was moved somewhere. We wont delete a valid post thats in the wrong area unless its just spam or flames. ^_^ Old super large posts are often retired to the archives or off topics moved to their respective forum. If not then you probably posted spam OR broke one of the community rules and one of the admins deleted it. Heck - it could even have been a complete accident and yours got deleted when it wasnt meant to be. Its happened before. :P
