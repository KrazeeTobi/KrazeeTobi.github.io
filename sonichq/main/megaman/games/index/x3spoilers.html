The maverick virus is actually Sigma's true form.  Whoever came up with this plot evidently ignored the fact that Sigma was a maverick hunter before he went maverick, and was not the first robot to go maverick.  When X confronts and defeats Sigma, Sigma attempts to take over X, but he is destroyed by either Dr. Doppler or Zero, depending on whether Zero gets damaged.  X gets philosophical again and we get the teaser that X must someday destroy Zero.This plot is interesting, but it takes away a bit from the original X storyline, in which "going maverick" seemed to be a conscious decision by sentient robots.
