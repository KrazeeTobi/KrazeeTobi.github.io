<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Intro</div>

<div class=itemtext>This is where the repetition starts in the MM series.  The plot and castle areas have obviou similarities to those of MM4, and the final boss is an almost total clone of the boss in MM4.  However, if you don't worry about that, MM5 could be considered the best game of the entire MM series.  It's extremely well balanced and polished, and many of the enemies use brains against you rather thn brawn.  Very few of them take more than a few hits to defeat, but most are shielded, attack at odd angles, use speed, fire multiple sprayed shots to make it difficult to dodge them, or even duck.  This is definitely one of the best MM games.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Story</div>

<div class=itemtext>8 mysterious robots have appeared, trying to take over the world under the command of... Protoman?  Protoman starts to act even weirder when he kidnaps Dr. Light, leaving his scarf behind for Mega Man.  SPOILER: Mega Man fights his way through Protoman's fortress, encountering 3 increasingly mobile robots (or is it 1 robot with upgrades?) named Sentinel 1, 2, and 3.  When he reaches, Protoman, he is reluctant to start a fght, and Protoman basts him, taking his energy to 1 point.  Suddenly, a whistle sounds, and another Protoman, this one with a scarf, appears, and the 2 start to fight.  The scarfed Protoman wins, and the unscarfed Protoman's disguise disappears, revealing a 4th sentinel-type robot.  Protoman gives Mega Man an L-Tank, which restores his energy immediately.  When Mega Man wins, Dr. Wily appears, surrprised that Mega Man had defeated "Dark Man."  He tells the Blue Bomber that Dr. Light is in Wily's castle.  After Mega Man defeats Wily's saucer, which is only a SLIGHTLY different version of the MM4 saucer, Wily runs away, and Mega Man chases him to where Dr. Light is.  MM rescues Light, but the castle starts to explode, and the roof falls.  Mega Man catches it, showing strength that makes Guts Man look like a shrimp.  Wily gets away, and you then hear a whistle as part of the wall is blasted away, giving Mega Man and Dr. Light a route out.  The walls is held up by someone just while MM and Light get out of the castle.  In the next scene, Wily's saucer is seen flying away, Mega Man and Dr. Light stand oytside the exploding castle, and Protoman is seen watching them.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Unique Features</div>

<div class=itemtext>Besides the Super Arrow, M-Tank, and Beat, MM5 is most unique for the way its enemies are handled.  As I mentioned before, most of them are lightweights who are placed strategically or use special techniques.  Mega Man also uses this strategy, as most of the special weapons in MM5 are light-powered, designed mostly to give Mega Man a way to hit enemies in many situations, or even block shots.  It should also be mentioned that this is the first game in which Mega Man uses an actual vehicle that he finds in a level.  Most of Wave Man's stage is played while Mega Man is riding a jetski.<br><br></div></font></td></tr></table>

<font face=Arial size=-1 color=black><div class=titlebar>Weapons</div>

<div class=itemtext>Gyro Attack<br>
Usefulness: 7<br>
Energy Cost: 1<br>
The Gyro Attack is similar to the Magnet Missile in MM3.  A gyro is fired stright forward, and you can press up or down to make it change direction vertically.  It's useful for hitting enemies at odd angles and has above average power.<br>
Napalm Bomb<br>
Usefulness: 6<br>
Energy Cost: 1<br>
This bomb rolls along the ground and explodes when it hits something.  You can shoot 3 at a time, which makes it handy for defending the ground directly in front of you, and it's very powerful, although you'll have to get close to use it against most large enemies.<br>
Star Crash<br>
Usefulness: 4<br>
Energy Cost: 3<br>
A one-hit 'rotating shield-type' weapon, the Star Crash can be used as its name implies, or thrown by pressing the fire button a second time.  It's very useful for blocking the falling crystals in Crystal Man's stage.<br>
Power Stone<br>
Usefulness: 4<br>
Energy Cost: 1<br>
This is an interesting weapon.  3 stones appear around Mega Man and quickly move outward in a spiral, covering a large portion of the screen.  However, the stones each have below average firepower.  This is a useful weapon agaibst flying enemies and in situations where many enemies are on screen at a time.<br>
Crystal Eye<br>
Usefulness: 4<br>
Energy Cost: 1<br>
The Crystal Eye is fairly powerful and a very cool concept, but there aren't really many situations in the game where its special properties become particularly useful.  It fires forward as a large shot and becoms 3 small shots when it touches a wall - one bounces back towards the direction it comes from, and the other 2 bounce off at 45 degree angles around it.  The shots continue to bounce around for a number of seconds.<br>
Charge Kick<br>
Usefulness: 4<br>
Energy Cost: 1<br>
The Charge Kick makes Mega Man's slide offensive.  It will go through some shields, such as the flipping shields of the ground turret enemies, though its power is just about equivalent to 1 or 2 regular plasma shots against most enemies.  Be sure to avoid sliding unecessarily, as it will count as a shot with your weapon energy.<br>
Gravity Hold<br>
Usefulness: 3<br>
Energy Cost: 4<br>
This weapon flashes and hits every enemy on the screen, floating any enemies it defeats into the air.  However, it only has as much power as a regular plasma shot.<br>
Water Wave<br>
Usefulness: 2<br>
Energy Cost: 2<br>
The Water Wave travels quickly along the ground.  Each Water Wave contains 3 waves in one, so it's usually good for multiple hits.  Although its firepower is less than average and it's difficult to hit enemies with it, the Water Wave has the unique ability to block enemy shots.<br><br></div><div class=titlebar>Items</div>
