<p>50 years ago, Professor Gerald Robotnik, the grandfather of Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Dr. Eggman), was one of the greatest scientific minds to grace the Earth.  He was the world renouned creator of the world's first space colony, the ARK.  It was aboard the ARK where Gerald, along with all his colleges and his granddaughter Maria, performed his research to create "the ultimate life-form", with the goal to ultimately find a way to benefit mankind.  That is, until the Government military, G.U.N., closed down all operations, and had the professor arrested for his "dangerous" experiments and taken to Prison Island.

<p>A short while later, Gerald learned that the ARK had been shut down.  Many people were killed aboard the colony, including his granddaughter, Maria.  Maria was all Gerald had left, and he now felt he had lost everything.  He completely lost his mind, and blamed the mankind he had sought out to protect, for all the misfortunes that had happened to him.  He wanted revenge.  He knew that he would be executed before he himself could do anything, so, making calculations on his own prison wall, he devised a program for the Eclipse Cannon back on ARK.  If the cannon were to be activated at full power, ARK would fall out of orbit, and impact the Earth, wiping out every human on the planet.  He also completed what truely was, the ultimate life form, Shadow.  Before he was killed, Gerald left behind his diary telling to release Shadow, in order to fill the world with hate and dispair, the same pain that he had to live with.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Next to nothing is known about the flying squirrel they call Ray.  He once worked along side Sonic and Mighty in destroying Eggman Island.  Afterwards, the three went their seperate ways, and Ray hasn't been heard from since.

<p>What is known about Ray is that though he is a little on the slow side, he's very agile, and obtains the ability to glide.  He's also able to swing on to things using his tail.  That's about it..</div><br>

<p>Sneaky and sly, when it comes to top secret spies, Rouge the Bat fits the profile perfectly.  She's hired from the government to investigate strange matters, one of which was the disapearance of the military's cancelled project:  Shadow.  She was ordered to find Dr. Eggman, and follow him aboard the Space Colony ARK to investigate what they were up to, and even went as far as to steal 3 Chaos Emeralds from the military's Federal Reserve Bank, just to keep her cover.  Though you could imagine she enjoyed that little endeavour, as Rouge has an obsession with jewels to go on the side of her spying methods.  This same obsession lead her to stumble upon the Master Emerald, as well as Knuckles.

<p>Rouge will go to any lengths to track down new and interesting jewels, and has developed what is practically a natural radar to help her track down jewels.  She has also learned many techniques to allow her to search for them virtually anywhere, such as digging and scaling walls.  Rouge is a true treasure hunter at heart, and perhaps this certain nack will lead her back to a certain echidna she's keeping her eye on...</div><br>

<p>The original concept for the ultimate life form was a creature who would open the doors for a better world.  That is until Prof. Gerald Robotnik went insane with rage, and created the true ultimate life-form, Codename: Shadow, to bring fear and destruction to the people of Earth.

<p>Finally freed from the military base 50 years later by the one, the only, Dr. Eggman (grandson of Gerald), Shadow wasted no time in carrying out the wishes of his creator, and had all of the Chaos Emeralds brought aboard the Space Colonly ARK to power the Eclipse Cannon, which he promised the mad doctor he could use to take over the world.

<p>One very important ability given to this hedgehog is Chaos Control.  By using this method, allowing him to warp time and space and instantly transport from one place to another, is what truely makes him the ultimate lifeform.  That is, until he learned that another hedgehog had mastered the trick, and had equaled him in power.  With the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds, Shadow becomes Super Shadow.  Super Shadow is invincible, and just as strong as Super Sonic.

<p>Though Shadow is a wee bit wound up in himself with being the "ultimate lifeform" and all, he does have and ooey gooey caramel center inside.  Shadow has memories of a mysterious girl named "Maria".  The young, crippled girl was one of his only friends aboard the space colony ARK.  Before being sent to Earth, he made a promise to her:  to make every human on Earth happy.  Shadow lived up to this promise by helping to defeat Biolizard (prototype of the ultimate lifeform) aboard the ARK and preventing the space colony from colliding with the Earth by using Chaos Control to transport it back into orbit around the planet.  In doing so, Shadow sacrificed his own life, just to keep his promise.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Silver Sonic was Dr. Eggman's first attempt at creating a robot duplicate of Sonic.  The only problem is, while Sonic is sleek, fast and light, Silver Sonic is the exact opposite.  He's slow, big and clunky, and relys greatly on razor spikes that stick out when he's rolled up in a ball (and how).

<p>Silver Sonic was first used to guard the Death Egg from Sonic.  It probably goes without saying that he failed miserably.  Silver Sonic was then rebuilt in a much more tall and imposing mech, and used to guard the Sky Sanctuary Zone while the Death Egg was being relaunched from Angel Island.  He was reactivated AGAIN afterwards to make one final attempt to steal the Master Emerald.  And he put up quite a fight to keep it by actually absorbing its power to become Super Silver Sonic.  But it just wasn't enough to defeat Knuckles, and the remains of Silver Sonic went down with the Sky Sanctuary Zone.

<p>Appearantly, Silver Sonic was rebuilt again, and was placed within an energy tube in the Final Egg.  Unless you count the exploit in Sonic Pocket Adventure, that's probably where he is to stay...</div><br>

<div class=profile>Faster than a speeding bullet - it's "Sonic the Hedgehog" and when he isn't rearranging the landscape with Tails, you may be able to find him chillin' on the beach of South Island, but for the most part, Sonic's on the move, discovering exciting new places, and waiting for adventure to follow.<p>

Perhaps the most interesting thing about Sonic is the fact that we know almost nothing about him!  He goes through life always facing forward to the future, ignoring everything behind him.  Almost nothing is known about his past, except that his is long time enemies with Dr. Eggman.  It's not known just how long Sonic and Eggman have been enemies, but though Eggman sees Sonic as a fierce adversary, Sonic thinks nothing of Eggman at all!  But ever since his first attempt to steal the mystical Chaos Emeralds from South Island for his own evil purposes, Sonic has always been there to meddle in his plans.<p>

Sonic owns (or owned, anyway) a red plane known as the Tornado, which he used to explore many mysterious areas of the world, including the legendary Westside Island.  It was there that he met his trademark partner, Miles "Tails" Prower, with whom he bacame instant friends.<p>

An excellent athlete, Sonic has been known to clock speeds faster than Mach 1 - not only that, but he's a highly skilled acrobat as well....His arsenal of moves include the Sonic Spin which can buzz through the thickest underground passageways. The Spin Dash, Super Peel Out, and Strike Dash are three different ways of utilizing his techniques.  Not only that, but he has learned to completely manipulate such items as shields - he can do a forward flame dash with a flame shield, a dpouble jump with an electric shield, and a bounce attack with a bubble shield.  When he isn't using a sheld, Sonic spins so fast that he can generate a temporary one with static electricity, increasing his attack range and making him temporarily invincible to some attacks.  This move even allows him to hit through the Egg Mobile's shielding rather than aiming for iys weak spot.  When Sonic obtains the Light-Speed shoes, he can charge up energy to launch himself at rings or objects.<p>

Although racing on anything but his own feet isn't particularly Sonic's interest, he does have a sleek red racecar he calls the Cyclone. When Sonic collects all seven Chaos Emeralds, he can utilize their positive energies to become Super Sonic! As Super Sonic, all of his natural abilities are enhanced and his speed is so incredible that he actually hovers a few feet above the ground rather than running on it! He is completely invincible to all attacks (except getting smashed or drowning). His color also changes from brilliant blue to shining gold.  When he harnesses the full power of the Chaos Emeralds, he becomes the indestructable Hyper Sonic.  Words cannot describe the power he possesses in this form, which includes the ability to wipe out all nearby enemies in a single blinding flash!  Sonic also possesses the unique ability to use Chaos Control, a move in which he can transport from one place to another instantly, thought only to be used by the ultimate life-form, Shadow.<p>

Though Sonic has made many friends (and enemies) in his time, everything is just a blurring flash in the eyes of this speeding hedgehog, always running forward.</div><br>

<div class=profile>If there is any well known name amongst the locations of Sonic, South Island would most certainly be it.  It houses the classic Sonic atmosphere with sparkling waters and checkered hill sides.  Though it has never been confirmed whether or not this is Sonic's true home (though in all honesty, does Sonic really have a "home"?), it is home to an assorment of different little animals including Flicky, Ricky, Pocky, Picky, Cucky, Pecky and Rocky.  It is home to probably more zones than any other location, and is also home to the biggest, and probably most over explored zone, the Green Hill Zone.

<p>Perhaps the strangest quirk about the island is it's cirular rotation in the ocean.  It was because of this rotation, along with the island's unique shape, that the mystical Chaos Emeralds drifted endlessly through a torison between the rifts of time and space.  That is until Dr. Eggman discovered their secret, and attempted to obtain them by building his base, the Scrap Brain Zone, in the exact same shape as the island, probably in hopes that the dimension would open within the base, handing the Emeralds, straight over to him (even though we all know he can do better than that).

<p>One last note would be that in Sonic & Tails, it was said that the island required the Chaos Emeralds to support its vitality, otherwise it would sink into the ocean.  It's hard to say whether this is true, but because the Chaos Emeralds have long since been seperated from South Island, it can probably be disregraded.

<div class=profile>Long ago, Tikal was the daughter of Pachacamac, chieftan of the Echidna tribe.  She, believing strongly in peace and harmony, was very turned off by the tribe's greed and warful ways.  Seeking relinquishment, Tikal felt at peace when at a nearby mysterious temple which held the seven mystical Chaos Emeralds (the servers), and the Master Emerald (the controller).  This shrine was also home to the Chao, who lived in peace under the protection of a powerful and trusting force.  Tikal had easily made peace with this force, and in return it allowed to play peacefully with the Chao.  It was this same barrier that was preventing the Echidna tribe from stealing the seven Emeralds for their own power-hungry purposes.

<p>Tikal did all she could to prevent their full on attack against the shrine, not even the emotion of her cause was enough to sway the decision of her greedy father, who had her, along with many innocent Chao, trampled by his men to clear the seemingly clear path open to harness this emmense power.  But then, the shrine's once peaceful and gentle guarding force, now filled with rage and anger as thick as the atmosphere surrounding it, absorbed the power of the Chaos Emeralds, and slaughtered every last one of the Echidnas.  Though she hated them, Tikal, barely able to withstand the horror of this meaningless destruction found only one solution.  She used the controlling powers of the Master Emerald to seal the guarding force, Chaos, along with her own soul, within the gem's confines.

<p>Much time passed, and eventually the Master Emerlad was shattered open by Dr. Eggman, releasing both Tikal and the still vengeful Chaos.  Using her ability to show visions of the past, she assisted our heroes in defeating Chaos, and turning him back into the loving, peaceful creature he once was.  Afterwards, they both dissapeared.  Where?  We may never know.</div><br>

<div class=profile>Vector may have a BIG mouth but that nothing compared to the size of his heart. Brash and brazen yet carefree and happy-go-lucky, Vector never lets a serious situation get in the way of a good time (or his favorite song). This cool croc is NEVER without his headset, even in the most dire of battles.

<p>If there's anything Vector loves as much as music, it's eating and speeding. He loves the rush of running when he isn't jammin' with his friends or investigating the local food courts. It's not yet known exactly how Vector got hooked up with the Chaotix...

<p>When Vector does a spin attack or spin dash, he rolls himself up into a ring shape. His 8-directional Power Boost move works like a jump or spin-dash within a jump, giving this cool croc some extra height or some quick acceleration. He can also scale walls almost as fast as Knuckles.

<div class=profile>Though a small and, for the most part, normal island, Westside Island, also known as the Island of Illusions, holds many secrets.  Including the remains of a long lost civilization.

<p>It is said that long ago, these people used the power of 7 magical stones to build a powerful (and clearly Roman-esque) society.  But of course, this power followed only in greed, and those stupid people started fighting over control of the stones.  Of course, the gods (or what is said to be the gods) weren't too pleased with this, so they took these stones away from the people, and hid them where they would never be found.

<p>Westside Island is relatively small with about 8 zones, but houses some unique animals (Locky, Wocky, Becky, Tocky, and an unidentified rat) as well as the native animals found on South Island (minus Picky.  Man, I miss that little guy...).  Westside Island was also the home to everyone's favorite trademark sidekick, Tails!

Even with all the mystery and adventure still hiding in the island, Sonic and co. have never seemed to have decided to make a trip back there, and sadly, probably never will.</div><br>
