implementing ideas! The local HQ goofball and a college student also, Dub is responsible for the upkeep of the various pages, making sure games and comics are done
as well as getting new sections out when necessary and making updates when he sees fit. Jonathan currently maintains the 
News, Comics, and games page. An artist in his own right, Dub also has a section on the fan art page. His future wish it to become a cartoon animator and produce his own series.</TABLE>

Vector and WB.<p>

<p>Big ol' Tony Baloney !!! We still think he has issues - 100 paper origami flowers? Tony - what ON EARTH were you thinking? *grin* Tony is VERY VERY generous for letting us use his site space for the massive graphics files on the comics page!
He even comes in sometimes and fixes errors he sees. Overall Tony is our third hand - but he's a GREAT third hand. He has to be great being related to Lien, little-brother and all ^___^

Knux is the guy furthest away! Would you believe he lives in Malaysia? Well he does! And I for one think its cool. How many people do YOU KNOW that you can say live in Malaysia? None. I thought so.
Knux hosts the fanmade Sonic RPG page in his spare time and also serves as a contributor to Sonic HQ. Malay schools are a lot different from American ones so he comes in when he gets his free time. All in all Lee is pretty cool. </TABLE>

<p>Everybody loves Raymond...erm....Roger !!! Yes, everyone needs a Fishboy on thier staff! Fishboy's are housebroken, they're nice and kind, and they don't wet the floor - well...not much....for a fish...
All you need give them is water and a Directory Page and you can be forever happy! Take Roger for instance - our local Fishboy - he's a really nice guy! He got us on various webrings, sorted our what was once our messed up Links Page, and is even making a 404 page for us.
All in all Fishboy is a great guy, and he'd make a nice entree at Captain D's too! ^_______^<p>
Fish also runs his own personal (and very good) Sonic webpage <a href=https://web.archive.org/20011101000000/http://sonicsages.cjb.net target="_whole">Sonic Sages</a>.</TABLE>

<p>I have NO IDEA what that giant sock monkey thing is to the left of here. ^_^ (Its off the Neverhood & Skull Monkeys game, fool  :) - Rlan) Joey is one of the younger of the staff, but he's cooler than an 
ice cube! Joey basically does a little of a lot of things around here, but mostly he updates Q&A - "Our Letters Page". ^_^
When he gets out of Middleschool (and then Highschool) he'd like a career in animation....computer graphics/animation
He also likes to listen to/ read almost anything, and play videogames and the computer.
