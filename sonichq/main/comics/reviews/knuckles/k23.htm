          This issue is the continuation of the story started in Knux #22.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First off, We get 
          a special broadcast by counciller Pravda, from last issue, saying he 
          will announce his successor for Councilor in a rally in Guardian's Park. 
          From there, we go to the reactions. General Stryker suspects Echidna 
          treachery (Sharp guy!), While Constable Remington starts planning some 
          extra troops just in case (you can never have enough soldiers in a rally). 
          Knux and the gang, however, are mixed on the subject. Vector says all 
          politicians are liers (True), while Espio says it doesn't matter who 
          gets elected. Knuckles says none of this involves him, but he still 
          goes to the rally along with Julie-Su and the Chaotix, saying he goes 
          wherever he's needed when Vector teases him about it. Remington comes 
          up and has a conversation with Knux about keeping in touch and the reasons 
          for the rally ( he doesn't know why it's held either). Just then, Pravda 
          and company show up in a fancy car, authorized for High Councilors. 
          Knux remarks how strange it is for the leader of a culture that renounced 
          technology to have such a fancy car. Good Point, Knux! I guess we shouldn't 
          mind the fact that Echidnas generations ago made a vow to give up tech, 
          huh? Prvada comes up to the stage, followed by a guy no body knows. 
          To give you a clue, it's the guy we saw next to brainwashed Pravda at 
          the end of last issue. Pravda makes a short speech to introduce his 
          replacement for High Councillor, Benedict! (The name you can trust!)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Benedict starts 
          on a speech of his own, glorifying the Echindas who saved Echidnapolis 
          by raising it above the clouds, and then makes Dimitri and his brother 
          martyrs of science oppressed by a demonized Council of Science. Just 
          as a squad of Dark Legionnaires Goose step in to the park, he then offers 
          the people (read Echidnas) a choice: Continue to follow the corrupt 
          old regime, or following the new path made by Dimitri, the Technology 
          Now party. He pounctuate his speech with a thinly veiled Reich salute, 
          immitated by many Echidnas, but not by any other creatures. (Nope, no 
          nazi references here).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut to Haven. The 
          Brotherhood (present: Thunderhead, Sojourner and Sabre) are monitoring 
          the speech (You kinda knew they would. Gardians know everything...). 
          They are presently engaged in a debate on wheter or not Echidnas where 
          right in going back on their vow of rejecting technology. Sojourner 
          is against the use of tech, Sabre is all for getting all the advantages 
          needed, and Thunderhawk is playing mediator. Their debate is suddenly 
          interrupted By an invasion force of Dark Legionnaires, who plug all 
          the brethren with sedative darts (they know everthing...except when 
          there's company at the door...).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back to the rally. 
          Benedict has finished his speech, and Remington now confronts him about 
          how he's linked to several known criminals. Pravda orders him not to 
          press charges on the DLs and to join him in the car to discuss this 
          in private. I suspect Remington's next on the lobotomy club list. Knux 
          and Co. come up form behind, curious as to why Remington hasn't already 
          ordered the mass arrest of all those Dark Legionnaires, seeing as they 
          tried to take over Echidnapolis recently. The puzzled crew leaves the 
          park, wondering on the DL's plan this time, while Vector and Julie-Su 
          go into their ritual "You're still a DL."-"No I'm not!" tirade.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We cut to the Dingo 
          Ghettos, where General Stryker is evaluating how to best use the present 
          infighting amongst the Echdnas to better his people's situation. General 
          Stryker seems to be a novel idea in the Segaverse: A character who is 
          neither a hero or a villain, but a shade of grey. He is willing to do 
          anything to help his people, which is both his quality and his flaw. 
          His conversation with Gerbil, his second in command (Gerbil? This guy 
          had a cruel mother!) is interrupted by spotlight and an order to surrender, 
          to which Stryker responds with a threat of his own. This Cyber-enhanced 
          Echidna called Xenin pops-up and clobbers Stryker before ordering his 
          DL stooges to take him away to the commander center.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, Knux and 
          Co. are walking to his Mom's apartment (doesn't he have his own place?), 
          and Espio starts feeling nostalgia about the "simpler times", before 
          the DL and Echidnapolis. Knux answers he doesn't feel anything like 
          that. Vector suddenly notices a truckload of Dingoes having been rounded 
          up and hog-tied in the back. Before they can act, however, the gang 
          is ordered to surrender by a few memebers of the DL retreival force, 
          flying squad (litteraly), led by Xenin, the Echidna-borg we saw earlier. 
          He tells Julie-Su she'll come back with them, wheter dead or alive. 
          Knux, the ever chivalrous guardian, takes off an rushes to take down 
          Xenin, who shrugs off Knux's best punch, then takes out our hero with 
          a single punch! (Knuckles is slipping...First off, he couldn't take 
          on Mecha-Sonic without getting Robotisized, then he needs his daddy's 
          help in taking Down Dimitri, then the Dark Legion, and now he gets nocked 
          out by a single punch, while it took two to take down Stryker...shame, 
          Knux, shame)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back to Haven. Our 
          three elders are tied-up, with Thunderhawk wondering how the DL got 
          into Haven. Sojourner answers that only one could have done this, of 
          course. Moritori Rex, everybody's favorite deep cover mole. (You'd think 
          the brotherhood would have did a security update after they learned 
          they ahd been breached. go fig.) He shows up just then, after getting 
          an intro by the female Dark Legionnaire who resembles so much a Dark 
          Lara-Le. Once there, he uses Haven tech to contact his own grand-dad, 
          Dimitri, who is pleased with the report, but wants Locke and Spectre 
          located. Just as Dimitri hangs up, we hear some one tell him in a familiar 
          defiant tone that he'll never get away with this new scheme. That's 
          our guardian for you. He doesn't beat up the badguys often, but he stays 
          optimistic and confident. We then see Knux, Julie-Su and Gen. Stryker 
          hanging up-side down in the middle of another Dark Legion HQ. Dimitri 
          is astounded by Knux's defiance (So am I, honestly; with his track record, 
          you'd think he'd be more afraid) Knux then says if this up-side down 
          thing is his worst, he'll be sleeping for a while. Dimitri answers that 
          this only the beginning, and that he's looking forward to some screaming.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          I personally thought that this was a pretty decent issue of Knuckles. 
          Just not one of the best. The Dark Legion as Nazi-like characters was 
          pretty predictable, but justly so. I Personally suspect that Echidna 
          culture as a whole is somewhat chauvinistic as a whole, with Knux and 
          close company as the notable exceptions. That Echidna in good neighborhoods 
          and Dingoes in ghettoes does mirror some present situations in America 
          today, doesn't it? The art is getting better, but not by much. All in 
          all, the episode lacked a little something... It was VERY plot heavy, 
          without much action in it. To compare it to a Star Trek: Deep Space 
          Nine episode type, it was a character development episode, but without 
          the character development. In my opinion, the fight between Xenin and 
          Knux could have lasted longer, especially if we're to believe that Knux 
          really IS some sort of special Guardian. Spectre's sudden disappearance 
          leads me to believe that he will pull a "Batman" (referring to the fashion 
          now used in DC's JLA of having Batman save the whole JLA single handedly) 
          and save all of Haven all by himself. Other fixtures were as espected, 
          but not a lot of development there. Even Vector and Julie-Su's argument 
          seemed tacked-on to fill in a panel. All I have to say about this is 
          the climax had better be good! In conclusion, I give Knuckles #23 3 
          out of 5 rings. They really need to shape up by next issue, or at least 
          by Knux #25. That's it.</font></p>
