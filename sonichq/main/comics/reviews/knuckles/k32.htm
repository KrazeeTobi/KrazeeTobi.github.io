          time for the conclusion of the last Knuckles comic storyline. Ho hum...</font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Well, we catch up 
        with Knuckles and Monk, the reluctant duo, as they decide to go into Hydro 
        City, a hidden city known to few that supposedly predates Echidnapolis. 
        They hope to evade Hunter this way. On the surface, however, Hunter follows 
        their trail to the Hydro City entrance and follows them down.
        <p></p>
        Back to Locke and Archimedes, they find what one can assume is Hunter's 
        ship (the art of it isn't very good, and no clue is left to identify what 
        it is). They poke around, trigger the ship's security systems (which blow 
        it up) and barely escape, unwittingly stranding Hunter on the Island with 
        them. And so ends chapter one.
        <p></p>
        Chapter two begins with Hunter closing in on Knux and Monk, unaware his 
        ship has been destroyed. After he takes a few pot shots, they elude him 
        again and try to set a trap. He catches up with them and shoots again, 
        making Knux duck down a level, causing the pain-collars to activate. While 
        Hunter is dumb-founded at missing a target for the first time, Monk decides 
        to attack him, tackling him to the floor. After a short struggle, Monk 
        becomes the latest casualty of Archie's more "Mature" storytelling and 
        gets killed by Hunter. This pisses Knux to no end, and he unleashes his 
        "Inner Chaotic Energies" to strip Hunter of all his equipment and knocking 
        him out, solving the problem "Deus Ex Machina" style.
        <p></p>
        When Locke and Archy finally arrive, they find the unconscious Hunter 
        and Knuckles grieving over Monk's still form. The next scene, we see Hunter 
        held imprisoned within Haven, in a prison pod (a large, life support connected 
        bubble held in a large vat of water), where he'll stay until he's either 
        dead, or until the writers need him for another storyline.

          Well, for the storyline that concludes the Knuckles comic series, I 
          must say I am tremendously disappointed. The storyline was thin, badly 
          executed and poorly drawn. They introduce a character like Monk, who 
          obviously has a rich history with Knuckles and the other Guardians, 
          only to kill him off now. That is a poor writing decision, since it 
          eliminates potential stories. Then again, since the title is getting 
          cancelled, I guess it's unimportant... Still, It probably would have 
          been nice if Monk had lived. Who knows, he could've been a good character 
          in the future. Oh well. Let's hope Knuckles gets a better treatement 
          once he returns to the Sonic comic. </font></p>

        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Espio 
          the Chameleon<br>
          Chapter Three: &quot;The Worst of Enemies&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Well, 
          this final chapter of Espio's story ends on a very sad note: Liza, Espio's 
          friend, has been roboticized by Valdez, former Secret Service agent, 
          another old other friend of Espio's, and now a reprogrammed robotic 
          minion of Robotnik's. Espio, who looks suicidally depressed, agrees 
          to lead Valdez to the Chaos Emerald, or Valdez will Roboticize the rest 
          of the Chameleons.</font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As Espio leads his 
        captors through the forest, he tries again to appeal to Valdez' memories 
        of who he is, but Vald just responds that if Espio pulls any tricks, he'll 
        use a radio signal to blow up the ship where the Chameleons are held. 
        Espio still leads them to a set of underground canal ruins that he claims 
        are the sewer systems (though it could just be Hydro-City, as featured 
        in the main story).
        <p></p>
        Once there, he fades into the shadows, and before Vald can react, he falls 
        down a trap door to a level below where Espio wrestles him into the water. 
        After they fade from view, we see Liza and the Shadowbots, wondering what 
        happens now that they've disappeared.
        <p></p>
        As we wonder that ourselves, we cut back to Valdez' ship, where Espio 
        shows up and frees all the others, before the ship blows up. He then says 
        Valdez was a warning shot to the otuside world, and that those outsiders 
        can't be allowed to drag the Floating Island into their mess.
        <p></p>

        <br>
        </b> Truth be told, this story was badly drawn, badly written and a bad 
        idea on its own. Espio looked terrible, was written as being a completly 
        passive fool most of the times, and his "dealing" with Valdez had "cliched 
        ending" written in neon letters all over it. If this was a sign of things 
        to come, it may be just as well that this title is being cancelled. Let's 
        hope the future Sonic issues deal with things much better.</font></font></td>
