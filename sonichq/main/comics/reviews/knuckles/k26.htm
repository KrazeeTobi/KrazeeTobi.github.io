        <p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">W</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ell, 
          after Knuckle's Big silver anniversary, we were left to ponder how they 
          authors would top that off. Here we have their attempt. Knux #26 starts 
          a new stoyline that is completly unlike the last few issues: A romantic 
          comedy! It might work... Let's start reading it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We join up with 
          the Chaotix eating in the restaurant area of a mall, discussing the 
          absence of Charmy. (Seems they're not too shaken up by whatever the 
          Dark Legion did back in #24, if anything happened) Vector seems to miss 
          the little guy, but wouldn't want the guy to give up the luxuries he's 
          being given with the throne: Status, money, babes... But when Espio 
          mentions Charmy's been betrothed to Safron (Last seen in K#14), the 
          concept seems to turn Vector off. I guess he doesn't want to lose his 
          precious bachelorhood. The conversation soon turns to a discussion of 
          women, which brings up Julie-Su.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking of her, 
          she's presently venting her rage at beeing left behind last issue, by 
          shooting pictures of Knux, generally feeling sorry for herself and blaming 
          Knuckles for everything. Knuckles, on the other hand, has just gotten 
          up in Haven, and his father is making him breakfast (Seeing how the 
          Chaotix just ate burgers, one can wonder if it's the Chaotix who don't 
          have proper diets, or the folks at haven who just get up late). Knux 
          doesn't seem to have slept well, and when his father asks him what's 
          wrong, he says he wants to know why Boys and Girls get together (Locke 
          seems to be Waaaaayy overdo with that talk, it appears). After the coffee 
          drinking Locke does the appropriate spit-take, he starts doing the old 
          Q&A routine with Knux, helping his son realise he's presently feeling 
          the Soultouch with Julie-Su. The Soultouch is the Echidna version of 
          "Love at Frist Sight", a way for nature to make sure the intellectual 
          Echidnas know when to mate with a compatible partner from the opposite 
          sex. When Knux asks the delicate question of why Locke and Lara-Le aren't 
          still together, Locke answers he still isn't quite sure about that. 
          When Knux says he still can't figure out this Guy/Girl thing out, Locke 
          tells him he should talk to Julie-Su before discussing matters any further 
          with him. Gee, what great timing! Maybe when Knux meets up with her, 
          she won't blow his head off just yet!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We catch up with 
          the Chaotix, who are walking down an avenue, chatting about girls (If 
          age questions are consistent, they should all be about 15-16, so it's 
          natural for teenage boys to talk about girls :-P). Vector says he's 
          a Real Casanova, and Espio dares him to put his money where his mouth 
          is. Vector, P.O.d, goes off to find a date. After scoping out some potential 
          dates, he tries to make the moves on one ("Doing anything this weekend?"), 
          who brushes him off (I'm studying to become a missionary"). Ouch! Oh 
          well, better luck next time, Vector.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back at her place, 
          Julie-Su decides to take a walk. She stops in front of a store where 
          she eyes a nice dress and hat. This Echidna guy walks over to her, and 
          says the hat would look good on her. Intrigued, she walks into the shop 
          with him, and lets him buy her the hat. He then asks her out for lunch. 
          Uh oh... Looks like Knuckles might have a few more problems in store 
          when he decides to go talk to her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking of Knux, 
          we catch up with him back at Haven, apparantly Sulking. Archimedes 'ports 
          in, and says he wants to talk, while his dad is doing his morning routine. 
          He wants to know how Knux is doing, and Knux says he doesn't know. Knux 
          is glad to be with his father, but keeps thinking of Julie-Su. He tells 
          Archy he's talked about it with his father, who didn't seem thrilled. 
          Archy says it's because he doesn't want his son exposed to the harsh 
          realities of love (understandable, since his own marriage went the way 
          of the Dodo...); he then tells him this ain't an easy matter, and that 
          only by taking chances will he make progress. Knux makes a decision, 
          and has Archy teleport him away, most likely where Julie-Su is, just 
          as his father is about to walk in. Knuckles needs to work on his timing, 
          or at least take time to say "I'm leaving, see you later!"</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before learning 
          where Knux and Archt end up, we find Vector at a Diner counter, sulking. 
          Seems he's been striking out regularly, by the looks of it. Then, this 
          nice Swan waitress asks him what he wants. Vector, apparantly charmed 
          (the hearts around the character never lie), decides to try his luck. 
          We'll have to wait until next issue to see if he succeeds, however. 
          We catch up with Julie-Su, who seems to be having a nice time, dining 
          out with the male echidna, who's named Raynor. Raynor asks him if she's 
          seeing anyone at the moment, and just as she says she doesn't know, 
          Knuckles and Archy pop in! To be continued!</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personally, I liked 
          this issue. It had a great storyline, and believable character portrayals 
          of each character. Despite the continuity flaws (What DID happen to 
          the Chaotix after the DL attacked?), this is one of the better issues 
          of Knuckles in a while. The heavy issues of K#22-24 have been left behind 
          for a light-hearted storyline. Let's hope things go right for Knuckles. 
          One thing that spoiled my reading of this issue was the inconsistant 
          art of Chris Allan, especially when it came to the Julie-Su's proportions. 
          Half the time, it looked as if Julie was flat-chested and with a huge 
          beer-gut! Pretty lame, seeing as almost all the other females in the 
          issue were shaped like super-models! Let's hope Allan gets his act together 
          by next issue (why does it seem that every new artist on the book takes 
          a while before getting the art right, and then, only just before they're 
          done with the story arc?)</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mighty 
          The Armadillo - Part One: &quot;Friend in Need"</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mighty 
          the Armadillo has an unexpected visitor at his place. Nic the Weasel, 
          a female weasel who bears some resmemblance to Nack the Weasel (aka 
          Fang the Sniper). In fact, she claims to be his sister, and is a bouty 
          hunter as well (Guess it runs in the family). It seems she needs Mighty's 
          muscles to perform a specific task, which seems to have something to 
          do with an egg-shaped object. When Mighty asks why he should cooperate, 
          she shows him a red collar, which Mighty recognises as belonging to 
          Ray the Squirrel, an old friend of his and Sonic's (from Sonic Arcade, 
          as I've been told).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Nic flys Mighty 
          to the mainland in her plane, he begins to remember how he, Ray and 
          Sonic first met, about 6 or 7 years ago. He and Ray were prisonners 
          aboard a slave barge, beeing brought to Robotropolis. Sonic was aboard 
          the same barge, but he wasn't a prisonner. he was a spy, sent by Sally 
          to infiltrate the slave camp to gather info. After saying what he was 
          doing there, Sonic split, saying they'd only cramp his style if he brought 
          them along. Mighty then remembers that they would meet again soon, but 
          that's where the Flash-back sequences ends.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nic lands in an 
          area Mighty find familiar, and they begin to look around, when suddenly, 
          they find they have company: Fiona Fox, last seen in ''Growing Pains'', 
          in Sonic issues # 28-29, paralysed by rust in a desert island. And yet, 
          when Mighty sees her, he screams out her name, as if knew her from somewhere. 
          What gives?</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          story is very well done. It fufills a continuity need by exploring the 
          shared past of Sonic, Mighty and Ray (rumored to join the Chaotix in 
          a few issues), and does a nice job of tying together the game continuity 
          of Sonic Arcade to that of the comics. Nic seems like an interesting 
          Char, for as much as we've seen. Further more, if you like mysteries, 
          you've just been given reasons to tune in next time with Fiona alone! 
          What past could she have with Mighty? Could it be her construction actually 
          predates "Growing Pains"? And what is she doing up and about in the 
          first place? I can't wait for next issue to find out!</font></p>
