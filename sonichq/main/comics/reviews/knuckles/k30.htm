          story starts of with a zinger: We see an overlander pull out what seems 
          to be a rifle, assemble it, kiss it (this guy needs a life) and shoot 
          a harmless bird! What a shocking scene!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, after that 
          teaser, we shift to the ground of Mobius Prime, on a mountain top in 
          the eastern hemisphere, where a purple ape in a diaper is revveing up 
          a lasso while the Floating Island approaches. He lassos part of the 
          Island's underbelly, then climbs all the way up to the edge of the Island 
          (Impressive feat, seeing how big the darn thing is), where he proceeds 
          to do a "Kong" number, boasting of how he's gonna get even with Knuckles. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our boy Knuckles, 
          meanwhile, is catching up on some ancient Echinda litterature his father 
          gave him. It's about the past accomplishments of the Echidna culture, 
          when their people explored space, with far-off worlds like Saturn and 
          Europa. When he wonders why an Echidna would be named Dave, and what 
          happened to a monolith (for those who are really clueless, he's reading 
          an Echidna version of 2001: A Space Odessy), Catweazle the rude bird 
          from last issue flies in! He warns Knux about the hunter from the beggining, 
          and Knux flies out. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In mid-glide, Knux 
          is hit by a rock and falls. He finds himself confronted by the Gorilla, 
          who's name is Monk. We get a brief flash-back showing us some history 
          between the two. Turns out Monk is an old childhood bully who took advantage 
          of a young Knuckles (must've been before he learned to fight). One night, 
          Monk was caught by the Brotherhood, tied up and, in a display of cold-bloodedness 
          on their part, kicked off the Island, litterally! He landed in the ocean 
          far below, and barely survived. Without so much as an explanation, Monk 
          attacks Knuckles, who fights back. They scuffle a bit, but while they 
          do, the Hunter is approaching...</font></p>

          For the last story arc this title's gonna get, (Knuckles ends with #32) 
          It seems like Ken Penders isn't trying very hard... The set-up is somewhat 
          sketchy, the characterisation is a bit off: The Brotherhood, whom we've 
          been told are wise and good, just perform what is essentially a sommary 
          execution! If Ken is trying to show us a new side of the Guardians, 
          I think it's a bit late in the series. The art is also a bit questionnable, 
          as Monk, who is supposed to be a Gorilla, seems only like a very ugly 
          and hairy human. All in all, not really what I'd call the best storyline...</font></p>

          the Chameleon Chapter One: <br>
          &quot;Hiding in Plain Sight&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
          if that wasn't the most obvious titles for a chameleon story... Julie-Su, 
          looking for Knuckles (who's been off in the wilds since Issue #29), 
          rides her Pasha to the outskirts of Echidnapolis and meets up with Espio, 
          Mighty and Ray, who's joined the Chaotix. They haven't seen him either. 
          Mighty takes Ray to check out Echidnapolis, while Espio hops along with 
          Julie to help her look. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          a while, Espio grabs the reins and stops the Pasha. It turns out they 
          were gonna trample an aged hidden chameleon, but Espio knew what to 
          look for (maybe Knuckles knows too). Espio runs to him, and sees it's 
          someone he knows, called Barney (if anyone has a purple reptile joke, 
          us it know...). Barney's hurt, so Julie decides to take Barney to the 
          Echidnapolis Med-center, while Espio stays behind to check things out. 
          After Julie-Su is gone, we learn the Chameleons don't interact much 
          with outsiders, and Espio gets some grief about his friendships. He 
          meets up with some other chameleons, including a femme called Liza.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liza 
          greets him, then she and the others lead him to see someone who was 
          looking for him: Valdez, who's been Roboticized, with a pair of Swatbots 
          behind him! To Be Continued... (annoying, ain't it?)</font></p>

          This story wasn't BAD, but it wasn't exactly GOOD either. The art was 
          good, and the writing was believable. But it's going so fast, you have 
          trouble keeping track of it all. Maybe if Ken had skipped the set-up 
          with the Chaotix and skipped to having Espio pay a visit to his Chameleon 
          friends, with some internal dialogue telling us about Chameleon Xenophobia... 
          Oh well. This is better then the last few back-ups, at least. </font></p>
