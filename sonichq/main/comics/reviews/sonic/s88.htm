          after the mediocre "storyline" of Sonic Adventure, we finally get a 
          story that goes somewhere!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          6 months of the SA adaptation and it's consequences, the Freedom Fighters 
          finally return to Knothole, and find the King leading an army of furries, 
          to rescue Prince Elias. The king gives us a short recap: Elias was captured 
          by Robotnik's troops, while bringing back a cure for Queen Alicia from 
          Robotropolis. So now Acorn's gonna lead his troops to save his son from 
          getting roboticized. (What some fathers will do to watch over their 
          kids...)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sally 
          orders Sonic to protect her father, while Geoffery is to make saving 
          Elias his first priority. Meanwhile back in Robotropolis, Elias tries 
          to reason with Chuck, but doesn't get through to the robian... Back 
          in Knothole, King Acorn excuses the wounded Antoine from battle, who 
          gets some reassurance from Bunnie, who stands by him (aaaawwww... ^^). 
          Sonic takes the time for a brief reunion with his folkds, then goes 
          to meet with the war party. As the heroes leave, Sally remains in Knothole 
          to wait for the doctors to treat her mother.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later 
          on, the attack begins and actually goes very well for the people of 
          Knothole, which forces Chuck to hasten the Roboticizing of Prince Elias. 
          Meanwhile, back in Knothole, Antoine and Bunnie request from Sally a 
          leave of absence to go to Mercia, where Antoine intends to confront 
          his father, now the High Sherrif of Mercia. Amy, who's Rob'o the Hedge's 
          cousin, decides to go with them. Sally was worried enough about her 
          mother and her brother, and starts to cry after Antoine and Bunnie said 
          they were leaving for Mercia... Poor girl's world is crumbling around 
          her...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
          in Robotropolis, Sonic, Geoffery and the King manage to keep Chuck from 
          roboticizing Elias, but fail to save Chuck and Muttzki, who, just as 
          they start to recover their senses, disappear behind a secret panel, 
          before Sonic can try to reach out to them. Just then, however, King 
          Acorn gets blindsided by a Shadowbot and knocked out!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          story ends back at Knothole, where Dr Quack leaves the operating room 
          after working on Queen Alicia. Sally is about to ask Dr Quack if her 
          mother's gonna be alright, when Sonic walks in carrying her unconscious 
          father. Geez, as if Sally didn't have ENOUGH on her nerves as it is... 
          She's on her way to a breakdown, mark my words.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Folks, 
          this is the first time in a long time I've rated a Sonic story 5 rings, 
          and believe me, I'm glad I did. Whatever curse was on the Sonic titles 
          has been lifted, and we're getting some great stories again. Karl Brollers 
          has shattered my expectations concerning plot and characterisation, 
          and I thank him for it. Even Fry's art was virtually perfect, combining 
          simplicity of basic design with extensive styling. Made for some great 
          visuals, including the "Army Assembled" scene on page 7. Check it out, 
          it's great.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's 
          good to see Karl Brollers finally giving all the characters some exposure, 
          and some plotting that actually leads into the following stories, including 
          Antoine, Bunnie and Amy's departure from Knothole, which leads directly 
          into this issue's back-up story, which we'll cover soon. Even Sally 
          gets some great characterisation, as everyone in her family suffers 
          in some way or another, causing her to worry more and more as the story 
          goes on, until that climactic scene where she sees Sonic, carrying her 
          fallen father... Boy, is Sonic gonna get it next issue.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Picking 
          up the Pieces" </b> </font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No 
          credits, but it looks like the same crew from SSS#14's storyline.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          now, for the back-up story, which picks up directly after the events 
          from "The Best of Times, the Worst of Times" from SSS#14, which left 
          everyone on the Floating Island trapped inside another Zone, with the 
          exception of the Dark Legion, which where the ones behind the incident, 
          and Knuckles, who fell off the Island and landed on some debris in the 
          middle of the Ocean.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
          wakes up and finds himself alone, in the middle of the Ocean, wondering 
          what happened to his people, and what to do now. Just when he asks, 
          he promptly gets a mystic vision of Athair, who tells him he must go 
          to Mercia to find Rob o' the Hedge, who will guide him to a solution 
          to his problem. He uses the Guiding Star Gem to go there.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          Mercia, Rob o' the Hedge confronts some weary travelers, whom he believes 
          are agents of his arch enemy, the High Sherrif. They turn out to be 
          Antoine, Bunnie and Amy, who were making their way through the forest. 
          BTW, fun fact: We get a small appearance of Mary-lin with Rob before 
          the confrontation... and it would seem She and Rob have already had 
          a child... Gee, those two work fast...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rob 
          first doesn't believe Amy is who she is, then believes she's bewitched, 
          and accuses Antoine, whom he realizes resembles the Sherif, of being 
          the one behind this. Before the argument can degenerate into a fight, 
          however, Knuckles arrives in extremis and stops the argument, and clears 
          matters up for everyone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          Antoine explains his reasons for being there, Knux reveals he's going 
          to Albion, where he believes they were all fated to go there. "...I 
          can't believe it's a coincidence we five have come together here!" And 
          so the collected crew prepare to leave for Albion...</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          story was as good as this issue's main story, actually. We get some 
          great characterisation from everyone from Knuckles to Rob, with Amy 
          getting a realistic reaction to her "aged" condition from Rob. The plot 
          moves at a good pace, with the plot not taking a backseat to the acting 
          of each character, but not ignoring the characters either. Very well 
          done. The art was also great, with everyone looking terrific.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
          in all, I can't wait for the next issue. After a long while, I'm finally 
          excited about an upcoming issue of Sonic... Happy Days! ^^</font></p>
