<p><b>The Cover: Very nicely drawn by Spazainte and Harvo, too bad
Heroic Age didn't do their part in coloring it. I have noticed some-
thing and you might have, too...the Knuckles comic has way better 
covers than the Sonic comic, both art and coloring. Oh well...at
least there's no more Manak covers.       
       The Text Page: A well drawn picture by John Hebert and Harvo
of Sonic running on water. Too bad it's covered by useless text again.
What happened to those classical Splash pages anyway?
    
<p>I was surprised by how
well Nelson illustrated this issue (better than his previous works).
John Hebert did a nice job, too even if it was really detailed.
       
<p>Pages 1-3: On the first page, the writer informed us that
Knothole Village is now a ghost town because everyone's moved to
Mobotropolis...blah blah blah...one former villager still embraces 
the familiar surroundings...and on and on...ok, here come the important
part and I quote "One who has became so accustomed to the way of the 
warrior, that leaving his city behind was the only real alternative."
Now, this is the first clue that hints the soon to come break up of
the Freedom Fighters I've seen. On with the story...Uncle Chuck and 
Tails were measuring Sonic's "air" speed. But Sonic wasn't in the mood,
he accelerated too quickly and wrecked Uncle Chuck's equipment...
evidently his still mad at Sir Charles for not telling him that his
parents were still alive.
       
<p>Pages 4-7: Later that day, Sally held a meeting with all the 
Mobians and selected a new council for the city of Mobotropolis. Dr.
Quack, Rotor, St.John, and Sonic were the members selected in to the 
council. Sonic was bored to sleep...we then jump 1500 miles to Devil's 
Gulag. Lieutenant Smiley and Commander Fleming were delivering the 
crystallized Warlord Kodos and Uma to the prison complex...then we
jump back to the meeting. Now everyone's gone, and Tails woke Sonic 
from his sleep. Time to measure Sonic's "ground" speed. Now, I might
be wrong, but isn't the Great Plains about 500 miles from Mobotropolis?
I know that Sonic and Tails can travel that distance in half an hour,
but how did Sir Charles keep up? Anywayz, Uncle Chuck gave Sonic a set
of headphones and Sonic started the test.
       
<p>Pages 8-10: As Sonic was running the test, he had a flash back
of the not-too-distant-past: "Uncle Chuck came up with the idea that
all the roboticized mobians move to Knothole. Sally agreed with the
idea and was going to okay the move with King Acorn. After a while,
Sonic arrived at Castle Acorn and saw in his uncle's face that the king's
said no." After the flash back we again jump to Devil's Gulag, where 
Snively overheard the MP's conversation about Naugus escaping from the
Zone of Silence. 
       
<p>Now we stop for some fan art and The Find Your Name In Print
Page. Hmmm, I wonder how old the fan arts are, I mean it's gotta be
at least 8-9 month ago when everyone still thought Sonic Jam would
be a basketball game.      
       
<p>Pages 11-14: Sonic, Tails, and Uncle Chuck arrived at the beach
of the Mobian Sea to measure Sonic's "water" speed...so, Sonic can
run on water. As he ran, Sonic had another flash back of a few days
past: "Rotor wanted to go search for his parents but Sally said no, so
Sonic decided to help Rotor out and go talk to Sally. Sonic found 
Sally and told her that she should know what it's like to want to find
her parents, Sally's response: "We need Rotor's technological skills
now more than ever if we're ever going to get back on track." Well,
Sonic agreed to that and left." Then we jump to Devil's Gulag again,
by this time Snively have heard the whole story and decide to go find
the wizard. So, he pushed something on his thumb...
       
<p>Pages 15-19: Sonic, Tails, and Uncle Chuck were back at 
Knothole Village. This time to measure Sonic's speed in artificial
environment. Sonic again blamed Uncle Chuck for not telling him
that his parents were alive, even Tails knew that it was not cool.
But before anything else can happen Sonic started the test. As he
was running, Sonic had yet another flash back of just a few hours
ago: "Sonic was walking through Mobotropolis and saw Rosie, he talked
to her about his problem, that he wasn't able to make a difference
now that Robotnik's gone. Rosie told him that the only difference is 
the one he makes...." Then we jump ship again to somewhere near the 
Devil's Gulag. Snively's radio signal set off the metallic eggs, and
they all cracked. Out came the Eggbots, their mission: Find the wizard
Ixis Naugus.     
      
<p>Pages 20-22: On page 20, panel one was drawn by Spazainte, now
you know...Sonic, Tails, and Uncle Chuck walked out of Knothole and
entered the Great Forest. Tails went off chasing a dragonfly(?) while
Sir Charles and Sonic stay behind to have a hedgehog to hedgehog talk.
Sir Charles said that is he told Sonic that his parents were alive, 
Sonic would stop thinking clearly until they're freed. Robotnik could've
used Sonic's emotions against the Freedom Fighters. Here comes the most
emotional picture I've ever seen SONIC in (Sonic hugging his uncle), 
with pretty powerful words, too (Uncle Chuck: "Please believe me." Sonic:
"I do...I do. It's all part of making a difference."--You wouldn't expect
this coming from Sonic.). Suddenly a strong breeze started to blow, 
and the three look up and see the Eggbots. Just then, Sally called and
told Sonic to get back to Mobotropolis right away...........NEXT ISSUE:
KHAN! As in Monkey Khan.

<p> This issue was REALLY GOOD. Karl hasn't seemed to grasp the "Sonic style" of writing though - but that doesnt make this issue not good!
Character development is one of the major things lacking in the books right now, and that page with Uncle Chuck hit the spot. Its obvious Karl works MUCH BETTER
with a longer story. Lets see just how well the new guy will do next issue?

<p>Sonic-Grams: Nothing new here, except that you get to find out 
#55 would come out in December, not November. Ok, Archie, what's going
on here? Did some artist take a vacation? Anywayz, the next issue 
would be chronicled by Frank Storm (new guy?), and inked by Ken Penders.
