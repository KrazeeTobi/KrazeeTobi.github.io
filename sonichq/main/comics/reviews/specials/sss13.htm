          the time of the apostles, 13 has been a number used in superstition 
          to announce terror, bad luck and calamity. The thirteenth issue of the 
          Super Sonic Special series only serves as proof that sometimes, superstitions 
          hold true. SSS#13 isn't a very good special.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                  starts out with a two-page recap of the last few issues, up 
                  to Sonic #82's fight between Sonic and Chaos. We then cut to 
                  the Station Square hotel, where Sonic brings everyone up to 
                  speed on his fight. Mayor Bullyani thanks Sonic, but makes a 
                  comment on how the creature Sonic fought sounds like an old 
                  local legend: Perfect Chaos, which is linked to the ancient 
                  ruins outside the city. Before he can say anymore, however, 
                  Nate asks where Amy went (You'd think he'd wait until after 
                  the plot information is completed before bringing her up).</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No-one 
                  knows where she's been since yesterday afternoon. Gee... and 
                  to think, they brought her along so they could KEEP TABS ON 
                  HER... Anyways, Sonic comes to the speedy conclusion that Amy's 
                  disappearance and Chaos' first appearance are linked, and that 
                  Dr Robotnik is the connection. Sally decides to split up into 
                  3 teams, so as to give the illusion that the teams Sonic isn't 
                  on will be doing something important.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                  Antoine and Bunnie are set on the sidelines with the excuse 
                  of "looking for Amy" in the city (like that's gonna do any good), 
                  Sally and Nate go "hunting for background" at the Station Square 
                  library and learn of Chaos'origin. For those who didn't get 
                  Sonic #82 (and I nearly didn't), a wandering tribe of Echidnas 
                  who entered the territory of Perfect Chaos, a living God of 
                  Water, and pissed it off. Chaos' people, the Chao, trapped Perfect 
                  Chaos' energy into 7 Super-Emeralds, unique items that were 
                  spread across the globe. Now, for those who keep track of continuity, 
                  one of them was the Super-Emerald Nate Morgan found a long time 
                  ago in the Temple in Sonic #67, and which was later used to 
                  give Sonic his Sonic Adventure Make-over and then made into 
                  the power-source for Sonic and Tails' new plane. And Nate also 
                  made the wish-granting Ring of Acorn out of it's energy. Not 
                  good for Amy, who is now impermeated with it.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  cut to Sonic and Tails, (aka the "Important ones"), who are 
                  flying around in their plane, looking for Chaos. They go check 
                  out those ruins the Mayor mentionned earlier, and find Knuckles, 
                  along with Tikal (spelled Ti<b>c</b>al now) in "flying ball 
                  of light" mode. But before Knux can finish explaining why he's 
                  there, Chaos attacks. Chaos knocks back Knuckles and steals 
                  the Chaos emeralds he had, absorbing them into himself. Tails 
                  sees some more Master Emerald fragments and decides to save 
                  those before Chaos (who's gotten larger) can get past Sonic 
                  and Knuckles to get at them.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
                  Tails gets tripped by Dr Robotnik, who scoops up the Emeralds 
                  and feeds them to Chaos, who grows even bigger and changes shape 
                  a bit. Dr Robotnik then explains that whenever he feeds Chaos 
                  a shard of the Master Emerald, Chaos grows more powerful. And 
                  when Chaos aborbs all seven Emeralds, he'll become Invincible, 
                  and destroy the hidden city of the Ancients, so he can build 
                  Robotnikland!</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hold 
                  it right there. Which is it? seven Super-Emeralds, or seven 
                  pieces of the Master Emerald? This is my only beef with Archie 
                  continuity, really. The undefined and ever-changing concept 
                  of the Chaos Emeralds. In the games, it was simple: there were 
                  Seven Chaos Emeralds, which were like a set of unique magical 
                  items. Sonic would need all seven items to become Super-Sonic, 
                  and so on. Then Archie messed it up by turning Chaos Emeralds 
                  into rare, but still plentiful rocks that irradiate energy or 
                  some such. Which gives us complicated attempts to mesh with 
                  the game continuity. But that's a whole other rant.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
                  to the fight: The Triple Threat do a triple move on Chaos, with 
                  Knuckles knocking it into the air, Tails blowing a sandstorm 
                  on in and Sonic using super-speed friction heat to incase it 
                  in glass. It almost works, until Chaos breaks free and escapes 
                  with Dr Robotnik.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  leave our heroes (who decide to go in pursuit) and cut to Big 
                  the Cat, aka "The Sideshow", who's tracked his frog buddy by 
                  smell into the middle of a river. While he decides what he do 
                  next, Robotnik's new Egg Carrier emerges from the depths right 
                  under him, stranding the poor Cat on top of it.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                  short moment later, Sonic and Tails catch up to the Egg Carrier 
                  in the Tornado, and get shot at by it. Odd how Robotnik's security 
                  systems can notice the approach of Sonic's plane, but completly 
                  miss a large Cat right on top of it, huh? Figures Eggman would 
                  mess THAT up. Sonic and Tails transform the tornado into it's 
                  jet mode (in a panel clearly drawn by Spaz) to dodge the missle 
                  fire, but have to crash unto the Egg-carrier since there's no 
                  landing gear in that mode.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  cut to Knuckles, who apparantly has been spending the past hour 
                  or so standing on a cliff, pondering (brooding heroes like him 
                  tend to do that) and finally decides to go to the Hidden City 
                  of the Ancients to warn everyone of Chaos. Back on the Carrier, 
                  which is shifting into Drill Mode to go through the Hidden City's 
                  mountain walls, Sonic and Tails move to the bridge, where Robotnik 
                  and E-102 Gamma await. Eggman just sics Gamma on them and leaves.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back 
                  to Knuckles, who's flying around when he gets a wierd vision 
                  of Tails' plane flying towards the Egg Carrier (never mind the 
                  fact they're actually miles away), inwittingly delivering a 
                  Super-Emerald to them. Knuckles decides to help them, and <b>Suddenly</b> 
                  finds himself on the carrier, wondering how we got there. Honestly, 
                  so do we. Must be Bollers and Penders being lazy writers. It 
                  would've been easier just to have Knux tag along with the Knotholers, 
                  mind you.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
                  Sonic beats Gamma rather easily, but gets interrupted by Amy 
                  just as he's about to tear it apart. Amy tells Sonic Gamma saved 
                  her, and begs him to spare it. We then cut to Big, who finds 
                  his froggy pal, who coughs up a Chaos Emerald, which matches 
                  one Big found on his way there (I guess that's something from 
                  the game, though we're never told) While Big wonders what to 
                  do, Robotnik snatches the stones and feeds them to Chaos, while 
                  telling it to absorb the frog too, which still contains Chaos' 
                  tail (so that's what it was the frog drank).</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                  Chaos transforms, Sonic tells Tails to get Amy out of there, 
                  while Gamma just leaves. Sonic then goes after Chaos, finds 
                  Big, and just sits on the sidelines while Big's pet frog leaps 
                  into Chaos, going after one of those Chaos emeralds again (geez... 
                  can you say STUPID?). While Knuckles arrives and sits by Sonic, 
                  Big uses his fishing rod to pull out the frog and walks away, 
                  leaving Sonic and Knuckles to wonder, most likely, where in 
                  their contract it states they have to step aside and let a bit-part 
                  character take the spotlight away from them.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
                  Dr Robotnik finally goes into action, summoning Ice-bots to 
                  attack Sonic and Knuckles, who have finally started moving against 
                  Chaos. The ice-bots freeze the heroes in place, while Chaos 
                  approaches (That's Robotnik's definition of a "fair fight", 
                  by the way.) Before Chaos can fully absorb Knuckles, however, 
                  Sonic knocks an Ice-bot into it, freezing it solid and giving 
                  them the time to break free from their ice-shackles before shattering 
                  Chaos into a lotta pieces.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  somehow provoques a chain reaction that blows up the Egg Carrier 
                  (villainous ships ALWAYS blow up at critical times. It's a rule), 
                  forcing Robotnik to fly away. Sonic wants to use the Tornado 
                  to do the same, but Big rudely steals the plane before he can 
                  (that's the second plane Sonic loses. You'd think he'd start 
                  using the Club), forcing him to bum a ride with Knuckles.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                  end this special with a short multi-panel scene showing Sonic 
                  and Knuckles parting company ('till next issue), Amy being reunited 
                  with the Freedom Fighters, Big having crashed the Tornado back 
                  home and Dr Robotnik flying off with a piece of Chaos still 
                  stuck to his egg-pod. Looks like this storyline is on-going...</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  story could've been better. MUCH better. Ron Lim doesn't seem 
                  to be good at drawing furries, as Sally and Bunnie look like 
                  shaggy dogs rather then a bunni or a squirrel. Bollers and Penders 
                  seem to be having quite a lot of difficulty joining the game 
                  and comic universes (not a new problem, but this is the first 
                  time it's been this messed up), especially with the Chaos Emerald 
                  situation, an issue someone at Archie comics needs to define 
                  seriously.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  plotline, at points, looks like it was hacked and poorly reassembled, 
                  such as when Knuckles is "teleported" unto the Egg Carrier by 
                  <i>writer's fiat</i>, or when the main heroes have to take a 
                  back seat while Big the Cat does "his stuff".</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, 
                  the vaunted "complete adaptation" of the Sonic Adventure game 
                  is anything but "complete" We barely get a fraction of Sonic 
                  and Knuckles' games, none of Tails' game, only a few scenes 
                  from Amy and Gamma's games and Big the Cat taking up everything 
                  else... Makes me wonder how much Big paid Bollers and Penders 
                  for the extra lime-light.</font></p>
                
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's 
          hope the following titles will be better then this. In the mean-time, 
          I'll be patiently waiting for a "Sonic Adventure Director's Cut Mini-series" 
          to wash up the mess made by this poorly designed storyline "event".</font></p>

          not this one. I expect a special to wrap up the story, hence the name 
          "special". There were many plot holes, (Like where Knux was all that 
          time before he met up with Sonic and Tails) that will be filled in soon, 
          but that just showed rushed writing, and filling plot holes later is 
          just a lame excuse to explain things later when the couldn't be fit 
          in. The art was okay, but not its best, and the dialouge was confusing 
          at times. If you hadn't read previous regular issues, you'd be confused 
          by this special. And if you had read the regular series, there's no 
          reason to get the special, because more than likely, things will be 
          explained in the next issues explaining what happened in the special, 
          which makes no reason to get the special.</p>
        <p align="left">Melissa "T2" Prower: (2.4) The art was okay, but the story 
          was BAD IMO. It could have been written better.</p>
        <p align="left">Nakkurusu: (4.0) The artwork was awsome, the writing was 
          good, dialoge was average and I was a little biased as Knuckles was 
          on half of all the pages of the comic...</p>
        <p align="left">jgehrts: (4.0) Ron Lim's art was pretty good, plus the 
          storyline on the whole was good too. As a longtime Sonic comic fan (since 
          issue #1!) this is what call the best long storyline in the series and 
          I give credit to those at Archie who've put this story together, especially 
          the Super Special in question.</p>
