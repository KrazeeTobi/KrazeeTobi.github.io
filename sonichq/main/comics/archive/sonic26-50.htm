                      in the middle of summer! Of course it's a plot by Dr. Robotnik! 
                      After lowering the temperature on Mobius, his plans will 
                      involve using infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded 
                      Freedom Fighters. Sonic and the gang take shelter in a cave, 
                      where they encounter a group of Polar Mobians that were 
                      trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived 
                      in hiding ever since! But after initially attacking the 
                      Weather Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the 
                      Knothole gang is then captured by Snively! Can the Polar 
                      Mobians come to their aid help destroy the Annihilator?</font></p>

                      Network) in Robotropolis, Sonic collides into a Swatbot 
                      with sufficient force to knock himself out! Coming to in 
                      Robotnik's headquarters, Sonic displays all the symptoms 
                      of amnesia! And Robotnik to his advantage passes himself 
                      off as Sonic mentor and advisor! After destroying some of 
                      the Freedom Fighter Auto-Automatons left over from the Princess 
                      Sally Miniseries, Sonic unknowingly has a microtransmitter 
                      planted on his person, as he is sent to Knothole to "observe 
                      the underground terrorist group"...Sonic then enters the 
                      secret tunnel entrance to Knothole Underground. But Rotor's 
                      security system detects the bug as Rotor tries everything 
                      he can to stop Sonic before he can get out of the tunnel! 
                      Sonic spins his way out to the surface and enters Knothole... 
                      apparently under the impression that his orders are to combat 
                      rather than observe... And in the meantime Robotnik sqeals

                      Village as our story is continued...</font></p>

                      are preparing to test the Transdimensional Transporter"

                      something goes wrong as the fat man ends up trapped in the 
                      Void! And as Snively, taking advantage of the moment, decides 
                      to go off to show Robotnik how to properly crush a rebellion, 
                      neither of them notice the one flaw in the explosion - Uncle 
                      Chuck has regained his consciousness and free will! So who 
                      else pops up just where Sonic is but Uncle Chuck!! But before 
                      there can be a tearful reunion, he warns the Freedom Fighters 
                      about the threat of Snively, who has plans of mounting a 
                      mini-transporter on the nose of a Robotnik Hovercraft and 
                      suck whole sections of The Great Forest into the Void until

                      but Sonic ends up sucked into The Void!!! With Sonic held 
                      captive can Uncle Chuck save the Forest, Sonic, and Knothole!

                      years ago, he wanted to use the Zone of Silence, developed 
                      by his "mentor", Warlord Kodos , as a sort of interdimensional 
                      concentration camp... Unfortunately, once he sent King Acorn 
                      there he realized that it was unstable and would soon absorb 
                      Mobius as well! Subjecting the zone to a steady stream from 
                      a photon cannon managed to keep it in check, but with the 
                      cannon destroyed by Sonic there may be no hope!! Robotnik 
                      gives Sonic an "energy inhibitor" as he convinces Sonic 
                      to detonate it within the Zone, but despite serious reservations, 
                      Sonic, Sally, Tails, and Antoine all enter when they confront 
                      a dark rider flanked by some weird Toad-like characters...

                      is to hover over the city in a giant saucer-like craft loaded 
                      with his Swatbots until the quake ends. And he doesn't particularly 
                      care what happens to the roboticised Mobians in the process! 
                      Uncle Chuck's plan: while Robotnik is hovering, they enter 
                      his HQ, reactivate the main deroboticizer and treat as many 
                      worker bots as possible before the quake hits! This assumes 
                      what Uncle Chuck doesn't: that Robotnik left a comfortable 
                      margin between takeoff and the quake. Unable to deroboticize 
                      the Mobians one at a time, he plans to blow up the roboticizer 
                      by overloading it, counting on the diffusion to deroboticize 
                      the Mobians in bulk, as it were! the plan works but the 
                      plane Rotor arrives in proves to be too small! And as the 
                      rest leave, Sally tries to find out from Nicole what's the 
                      best way out of Robotropolis during an earthquake... as 
                      a sizable chunk of masonry lands on top of her!!! Can Sonic 
                      get them both out in time? </font></p>

                      starts out as an annoying itch turns out to be a spreading 
                      case of roboticization!! Thanks to a convenient hologram 
                      of Robotnik to describe the plot, it turns out that Bunnie 
                      may have been partially roboticized at one time, but a "microscopic 
                      device" implant has started to finish the job!! And it is 
                      on the verge of total roboticization, she leaves Knothole. 
                      After traveling all night she falls asleep and wakes up

                      has just proposed that he allow himself to be roboticized 
                      with a Neuro-Overrider (Sonic 29) to counteract the effect 
                      on his mind so he can trash Robotnik! Rotor's objections 
                      are seconded by Bunnie, who literally puts her foot down 
                      on the subject! And as Sonic walks out abominably frustrated, 
                      Antoine questions his loyalty...Something that Sally DON'T 
                      like!!! To work off his frustration, Sonic heads for a "new 
                      training facility" in the Great Forest, conveniently located 
                      next door to the "Knothole Jail". Sonic no sooner walks 
                      in the door as Nack the Weasel drops a barbell on Sonic's 
                      head as he continues on with the plot from Triple Trouble 
                      to deliver Sonic to Robotnik for prompt Roboticisation! 
                      Upon arriving at Robotnik's, Nack informes the big guy that 
                      he won't turn Sonic over until he's been paid. Robotnik's 
                      counteroffer is that Nack gets to leave Robotropolis alive, 
                      and he brings in a giant Crabmeat bot as the dealmaker!! 
                      Nack sees the fairness in this arrangement and goes off 
                      into the sunset to be seen in Sonic 40! Without further 
                      ado, Sonic is then transformed into Mecha-Sonic! His assignment: 
                      level Knothole Village! But Mecha-Sonic's initial attack 
                      is blunted when he's confronted with multiple holographic 
                      images of the Freedom Fighters to shoot at when who should 
                      arrive on the scene but a Bunnie Rabbot as her and the roboticised 
                      Sonic go one on one! Sally puts in a call for help, which 
                      Tails relays from Knothole to...The Floating Island! Robotnik 
                      meanwhile has been monitoring the fight and promptly sends 
                      a electric current through Mecha-Sonic and into Bunnie and 
                      in the end bunnie is a shriveled unconcious heap, next to 
                      Sally! Now there seems to be nothing standing between Mecha-Sonic 
                      and a soon-to-be flattened Knothole! Tails, meanwhile, has 
                      been briefing Knuckles, who's glad to take on Sonic because 
                      of previous grudges, but this goes nowhere as Knuckles is 
                      out of commision from the start! So Sally orders, with much 
                      regret, "Operation Last Resort" -- as our story is to be 
                      continued in The Mecha Madness Special!</font></p>

                      Acorns... An ancient scroll is trotted out, which indicates 
                      that the true crown may be located in the Hall of Limbo. 
                      Next step: get enough power rings to fire up Sonic's brain 
                      cells so he can get to the Hall! But early next morning 
                      Sonic, Sally and Tails rendezvous with Sleuth Doggy Dogg

                      he brings in a welcoming committee of Swatbots, with a roboticized 
                      Fly Fly Freddy providing air cover as it leads to a free

                      up to Sonic to use the power ring to boost his brain and 
                      travel to the Hall of Limbo. And upon his return he declares

                      That's the question as, in the Knothole Infirmary the gang 
                      holds vigil over the crystallized body of King Acorn. And 
                      in a small adaption of Blast To the Past (Sonic the Hedgehog 
                      - SatAM) we go into the kings mind as we see Sonic and Sally 
                      as children... Julian of the War Ministry was supposed to 
                      be overseeing the dismantling of that department; he, however,had 
                      other ideas - And changing his name to Ivo Robotnik, he 
                      staged a coup that would have devastating effects. And as 
                      King Acorn has been banished to the Zone Of Silence, he 
                      lets out a horrible cry... Sally has come to the conclusion 
                      that something's bothering her father but she can't say 
                      what. And thus we are first introduced to the Dream Watcher, 
                      a device that will have great ramifications in the upcoming 
                      Endgame story arc as Sonic has been assigned to begin a 
                      journey into the King's head... Sonic and the King encounter 
                      each other in a space-like void, only now the King has no 
                      trouble recognizing Sonic as Sir Charles' nephew. But before 
                      they can say thier hello's enter - Warlord Kodos (Sonic 
                      #36) and Feist; One the former Warlord of Acorn and the 
                      other an evil being with a strange look! But is this all 
                      real or is there more to these strange attacks...</font></p>
