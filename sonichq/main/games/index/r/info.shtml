Welcome to the world that is Sonic R!  The second NEW Sonic game for the Sega Saturn platform, Sonic R defines a new definition of speed as Sonic and his friends race to the finish line!  You can choose from up to 10 different characters to race as through 5 fully 3D levels!! Sonic and Tails are enjoying a little time off from their latest adventures. The trip they have planned will be a nice, relaxing vacation.  Or so they think...
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Tails spots a huge sign alongside the road they are currently traveling on. It is a recruiting advertisement for the Mobius Grand Prix.  When tails spots a sign advertising the Mobius Grand Prix it becomes a chance for the ever ego-boosting Sonic The Hedgehog to show his fantabulous speed! But the real interesting thing about the race is that Robotnik is one of the racers! And where there is Robotnik, there's sure to be trouble! And trouble it is! Robotnik has set a trap for our heroes as well as laying the grounds for an elaborate scheme to get his hands on the Chaos Emeralds as well, especially since now he has learned of thier location!!! But Sonic is not the only one who will be racing with Dr. Robotnik! Sonic's rival, Knuckles, has learned that Sonic will be participating in a very important race and Knuckles never turns down a chance to be around Sonic when the action starts! And Amy Rose will be there too. After secretly overhearing Dr. Robotnik's plans, she also will be racing to find the Chaos Emeralds! So now there's an all out free for all to see just who will first find the Chaos Emeralds and win the Mobius Grand Prix!!! Let the races Begin!

<p><b>Clean Pause:</b> While playing, pause the game and press X + Y + Z at the same time. 

<p><b>Duplicate Characters:</b> Player 2 can play as the same character as player 1. The first player picks a character then the second player high lights the same character. Hold X + Y + Z. This also works for Super Sonic and all hidden characters. 

<p><b>Manipulate The Title Screen:</b> To have a little fun with the title screen, wait a moment, then fiddle with the D-pad. the "R" will rotate to your will. If you press the B button, the color of the R will change to a metallic outlook. Pressing the A Button restores the R to its former color. Pressing Y and X will darken or lighten the R. 

<p><b>Trouble With Metal Sonic ???:</b> An easier way to beat Mecha Sonic after collecting the 5 tokens is to first capture The Tails Doll who is easier to get than the Metal Sonic and then use Mecha Tails against Mecha Sonic, cutting across the water to get a lead. Always make sure you run through the ruins or the open 20 ring door. 

<p><b>The Ring Station:</b> After the accelerator in Reactive Factory continue to go straight forward. When you come to split in the road take the left road. If you continue up this road you will end up passing by a sign on the side of the road that says RING. Stop at that sign, and if you wait rings will come to you, giving you up to 999 rings. 

<p><b>Zoom In / Zoom Out:</b> On the main screen, the character screen and most screens, push the L button to zoom in and the R button to zoom out.

Sonic is the fastest of all the racers. He’s so fast that he almost lifts off the ground when he runs. Because of this, his cornering is often not as good as other racers, be wary of high, sharp curves. Sonic also has excellent jumping ability too! Due to the fact that he goes SO FAST he can literally "jump on air" allowing him to often pass others that barr him going any further, or crossing obstacles that would normally give him a hard time. Sonic can also perform spin jumps as well! If you hold down and continually press A, C, or Y, Sonic will rev up a spin-dash - let go and off you go like a hyperkinetic cork! You can spin-dash right from the start of the race to get a head start on the opposition. Simply start the spin-dash before it says "Go", and release Down right when it says it to get ahead.

<b>Sex:</b> Male<BR>


</center>

</blockquote><p align><b>
Tails is not as fast as Sonic, but he accelerates and corners well. Jump and grip are fairly good too, but best of all, he can fly! But one of his most surprising abilities is propelling himself underwater - a great way to get ahead of the rest of the racers! However, his speed will never allow him to beat Sonic or Knuckles in a straightaway...Like Sonic, Tails can jump in the air and spin-dash. He can also fly for a few seconds by jumping in the air, then pressing and holding A, C, or Y while up there. Tails can also spin-dash from the start of the race to get ahead. </p>

</blockquote><p align><b>
Maybe Amy’s car doesn’t have a very high top-speed, but there are some pretty wonderful things it can do. For one, it acts as a fast hovercraft on water. And look out when she fires the turbo boost! It can DEFINETELY get you into first place, but it can also make you lose control if not used well! But it will NOT work on water...Amy's hovercraft can automatically hover when you go on water. When a tire symbol appears in the top-right area of the screen, press A, C, or Y to fire your turbo boost and rocket ahead! Even though you can't turn too well while using the turbo boost, you can press L and R to help turn a little bit. Like Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, Amy can jet forward in front of all the opposition at the start of the race. Simply hold A, C, or Y until the announcer says "Go" to boost ahead for a head start. Amy is best for exploring the course for secrets, not in a straight-out race. Use her to learn the tracks in a Time Trial race....</p>

</blockquote><p align><b>
Knuckles is the overall well-balanced contestant in the race. His ability to stay on the road is outstanding, and cornering is quite good. Knuckles can also glide after jumps, BUT he can NOT keep up with Sonic...Knuckles can jump and spin-dash just like Sonic and Tails. To glide - jump in the air, then press and hold A, C, or Y. Knuckles can spin-dash as well at the start to gain a lead.</p>

</blockquote><p align><b>
Robotnik has returned in his faithful Egg-O-Matic to even up the odds!!! The machine cruises over water and is good for cornering, but no contact with the ground means no grip! But you know the dubious doc ALWYAS has tricks up his sleeve...namely the homing missiles! Like Amy, Robotnik can hover with his Egg-O-Matic. He also has homing missles you can use by pressing A, C, or Y whenever a green target appears over a racer in front of you. You must have 10 rings to use a missle. He's great fun in two-player matches when you feel like blasting people out of the water, but not good to use in races. Use him to learn the courses as well.

Metal Sonic has one edge that Sonic doesnt - the ability to hover. And this can make him faster in some areas while he is not faster than Sonic himself! However - along with his good, MS has his faults as well. For one thing Doc R screwed up again in the design - its true that he hovers, but if you stop moving he falls into the water like a moron. It's even more important to watch your speed on corners as his speed cant handle them well at all... </p>

Possibly one of the creepiest of ANY Sonic characters, the Tails Doll does not rejoice at the end of laps, it does not make any kind of gestures during a race....Complete with the stuffing down his back it just sits and stares like a blank zombie...His flight mode is absolutely perfect just as long as you dont slam into an object, such as a wall. He also hovers over water while standing still and will not fall in at all. He's a little bit slower than Tails and wobbly as well and cant take to flight immediately if jumping off of hills....

Metal Knuckles can be considered as a balanced racer with a few more faults than Knuckles....Along with good speeding, gliding, and hover capabilities, Metal Knux also posses Metal Sonics faults - not being able to corner well and falling into water like an idiot after hovering and not moving. </p>

He's baaaaacccckkk.....The ULTIMATE SONIC is back and rarin' for action!

It’s a wonderful day for a race on this tropical island paradise. A nice blue sky, lots of greenery, a pretty waterfall…it’s all here. Get too enchanted, though, and you might slip into the water or bump into a coconut tree. Take the time to hop around the smaller islands. Going for a little rock climbing is well worth the effort too. 
</P>

<p>Location Of The Tokens - </p>

Token #1; On the 1st bit of track you usually pass under a rock 
formation. Look on the top of it. <BR>
Token #2; Behind the waterfall after the rock formation.<BR>
Token #3; In a 20 ring tunnel at the right of the entrance to the ruins bit.<BR>
Token #4; On a solitary island right of the hairpin turn.<BR>
Token #5; Just before the loop there is a split in the track. Take the left (longest) route here.<BR>

This course is plenty wide. Gaps in the railing aren’t just accidental breaks! Waterways look like slow going at first, but they can save you some time if you know which turns to take. And speaking of turns, there are a couple of tight ones to add to your fun. Ever wondered what it is like to be a pinball? 
</P>

<p>Location Of The Tokens - </p>

Token #1; After the 1st dip in the track (with the water) keep left and drop down the hole. <BR>
Token #2; Same as above, but do NOT drop down the hole, jump on to the track. Continue forward and smacsh the barrier.<BR>
Token #3; After getting the above coin, Get back on the main track, and 
you'll see another route behind you. Back-track down this route.<BR>
Token #4; Continue forward from the last coin, and smash through a barrier seen at the right of the track. The coin is in the middle of
the huge pinball table.<BR>
Token #5; Just before the speed up, there is a 20 ring passage to the 
right. As well as hiding a coin, this is an excellent shortcut.<BR>

This one's a killer.  These ancient Egyptian remains are an archaeologist’s dream (or a nightmare, depending on if you like mazes or not). The main path is pretty easy to follow, but there are many little roads and nooks which could be hiding treasure, so search well! Springs might help you out of tight spots in this course. </P>

<p>Location Of The Tokens - </p>

Token #1; After the 1st turn right, there is a hump and a left turn. Go over the hump. <BR>
Token #2; Coming up to the built-up area there is a slope with two 
springs to the left. Jump on the second one you see.<BR>
Token #3; Just follow the track as the CPU racers do... It's pretty highup.<BR>
Token #4; Finishing the lap (almost), stick to the left on higher ground. 
You should see it.<BR>
Token #5; At the right of the slope mentioned for the 2nd coin. Go up 
some stairs and follow the path around.<BR>

Here you are transported into the future! Enter the factory of tomorrow, a completely automated wonder. There is lots of room to run, but there are also many hidden surprises and traps. What appears to be a simple course is really the hardest of the four. </P>

<p>Location Of The Tokens - </p>

Token #1; Continue forward from the start line, and it's behind a grey submarine. <BR>
Token #2; Now turn right around and head for the right of the track. 
Jump a small pool and get the coin. Head to the tower, and behind 
it is an entry. Hit the spring to get out quickly<BR>
Token #3; Hit the track's speed up when you see it, and when your burst 
of speed ends, take the right hand route and backtrack to find a 
coin in the track centre.<BR>
Token #4; ... And follow the route around to find another coin! That's 
why you should have back-tracked!<BR>
Token #5; Near the end of the track (If you stick to the track proper - 
the topmost routes) There is a 20 ring entry to the right of the 
track. It's here.<BR>
