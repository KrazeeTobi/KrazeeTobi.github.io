Created by The Sonic team, Sonic Jam are the four ABSOLUTE, UNDENIABLY BEST SONIC GAMES of all history "jammed" onto one CD with some extra stuff thrown in just for good measure. Sonic The Hedgehog 1, Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Sonic The hedgehog 3, and Sonic And Knuckles!!! And aside from the camera needing just a tad of tweaking, it looks absolutely incredible. Also included was the incredible 3D Sonic World - making this a total of 8 Games In One!!!</p>

<p>There are eight missions to complete around the Sonic World...complete them all within the time limit, and...well, I won't spoil anything. The missions are a nice way to pass time, but like many of those in Mario 64, they're just plain pointless. The GOOD STUFF however comes in the various museums. There's a nice art museum, a character profiles building, and a sound test shrine!!! But the two shining graces are the Movie Theater and the Hall of Fame! The Hall of Fame gives a COMPLETE and THOROUGH timeline of events since Sonic's conception in 1990! The movie theater has some really cool (and sometimes just plain bizarre) clips. There's the opening and ending animation to Sonic CD (with the original Japanese songs, "You Can Do Anything" and "Cosmic Eternity"), as well as a short preview of the head-over-heels Japanese Sonic Anime, a clip of high-quality American animation which NO ONE has yet to identify (It's not the SatAM or AoStH toons we've all seen...), an unpublished computer-animated "Sonic Ride", and a junk load 'o Japanese Sonic commercials. </p>

<p>But at the core of this cosmetical fluff is a 100% tear-jerking, those were the good ol' days, 16-bit heyday journey through Sonic's history. At first, you're a little disappointed that the original 16-bit graphics and sound were there, but you get over that in a Sonic second, and the more you played the more you appreciated the fact that they kept everything in its ORIGINAL form. The ONLY REASON Sonic Jam doesn't score a PERFECT 10, was because it introduced nothing completely new. That's absolutely the ONLY bad thing I can mention about this game. Everything else is sheer gaming bliss in its finest form. The features of having each Zone become a playable Time Attack level, three different difficulty settings (With some change in object-placement within the levels!!!), and a new save feature in Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 make it worth the price of admission even if you already own all four Genesis versions. The complete English and Japanese manuals are also available (The Japanese manuals are full-color throughout!), and the option to play the Special Stages without actually having to do the whole 50-Rings bit in the games!!! Experience classic Sonic gameplay in its absolute finest form. You will see the sub-conscious messages. You will offer sacrifices to the Great Blue One. You will steal all the rings and emeralds in a jewelry store thinking you are in a Special Stage. You will...ummm....*ahem*

<p><b><center>The Code Bank</center></b></p>

<p><b><center>***NOTE*** All codes for Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and Sonic And Knuckles are located within thier respective faqs. These faqs are accessible by their links, located below.</center></b></p>

<p>
<b>The Digital Manuals!!!:</b> To view the digital manuals for the Sonic games on your computer screen, put the CD in your computer and look in the Man_Eng and Man_Jpn folders. The manuals are stored as .TIF files, which can be read by most professional paint packages (e.g. Paint Shop Pro) This can be useful if you want to print out sections of the manual (e.g. High score tables) 

<p>
<b>View The Sonic Museum Pics on Your PC!!!:</b> [Use a paint package that can support raw data files e.g. PSP4]. Open the MDG2 folder on the CD, and load one of the files, telling the program it is a raw data file. For the width, enter 640. For the height, enter 448. If there is a colors dialog box, set it to single channel (grayscale). After the picture has loaded, use the Negative Image tool. You should now have a b/w image from the Sonic Museum on your PC screen! (Note: For some reason, the picture is offset to the left - nothing is wrong with your computer!) 

<p>
<b>Title And Info Pics on Your PC!!!:</b> If you have Paint Shop Pro, you can view some of the title screens and other backgrounds etc. Put the CD in your PC again, and select the Browser function. Enter in D: (or whatever your CD is), and it should come up with some pictures from the game. 

<p>
<b>Bonus Images !!!:</b> For some nice screen shots and wallpaper, place the Sonic Jam CD in your computer. Go to your Windows Explorer and look in the "Extras" folder! 

<p><b>All The Movies At Once:</b> To watch all the movies in the theater in sequence, press X, Y, and Z, and while holding these, press A. It'll take longer to load up then usual, then you'll watch all the movies in order. If you watch carefully you'll notice a few that aren't available in the theater selection screen. 


<p><b>Sonic And The Quest For 100 Rings !!!:</b> 

At the title screen, highlight "Sonic World" then hold A and press START. This will send you into Sonic World to get 100 rings in under 60 seconds. Good luck! 

</TD>
<TD WIDTH="50%"><CENTER> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="COMIC SANS MS">

<p>
<b>The Great Golden Ring:</b> To view the credits for Sonic Jam, go to Sonic World, and complete all of the world missions. Once you have, go to the waterfall. You should see a gigantic gold ring. Now, go on the platform near you that goes up and down. When it's at its highest point, jump in the huge gold ring and you will be able to view the credits for the game. 

<p>
<b>The Panoramic View:</b> Once you fulfill all the mission objectives, not only will the golden ring appear, but you will be able to use a panoramic view as well as the close and far views you use to control Sonic in Sonic World.

<p>
<b>14 Continues In Sonic 2 !!!:</b> At the options screen, play sounds 01, 01, 02, 04. 

<p>
<b>Clean Pause:</b> For cleaner screenshots, press X + Y + Z simultaneously while the game is paused to remove the menu screen. 

<p>
<b>Hidden On The Monitors...:</b> In the Sonic World segment of the game there are polygonal versions of the power up boxes in the Sonic games. Walk up to them and press either A, B, or C to read them. Each one gives a different code that can be used on the different Sonic games. 

<p>
<b>Easy Level Select In Sonic 3:</b> Start "Sonic 2" and play sounds 19, 65, 09 and 17. Now hold A and press RESET, but don't release A. When the game restarts, choose Sonic 3. When the title screen appeasr, release A and press UP to reveal the SOUND TEST option. Select this to enable Level Select

<p>
<b>Sonic 2 Music On Your PC!!!:</b> Place Sonic Jam into your CPU. Open Windows Explorer and look in the Sonic Jam (Sega) section. If you look in the Sonic12 folder, you should find some music from Sonic 2 in AIFF format!! 

<p>
<b>Tails In Sonic And Knuckles!!!:</b> Play Sonic & Knuckles and lock it on to Sonic 3. Play as Tails alone and beat Sonic 3. (It's not so hard). Then you can play Sonic & Knuckles as Tails. 


<p>
<b>Unlocking ALL The Levels In Time Attack!!!:</b> To unlock all the levels in Time Attack mode for Sonic, Sonic 2, or Sonic 3 enter the level select code for that game and play the final level. This will automatically unlock all the levels until you clear your Saturn's memory.

Meet Sonic The Hedgehog as he strives to free the planet of Mobius from the tyranical reign of Doctor Ivo Robotnik! As Dr. Ivo Robotnik makes his first move against planet Mobius, unleashing his technology on innocent animals and turning them into evil robots a new hero steps up into the spotlight - a blue super quick hedgehog named Sonic - And a legend is born! Only this super-cool hedgehog can save his friends and Mobius, then show Robotnik who's boss. Spin through space, loop 'til you're dizzy, and save the animals to become the super hero. The very first Sonic game on Genesis, created in June 23, 1991. This game began the Sonic legend and put Sega on the map! This game had 7 levels consisting of the Green Hill, Marble, Sring Yard, Labyrinth, Starlight, Scrap Brain, and Final Zone. It also introduced the 360 degree rotating special stage to access the Chaos Emeralds.

Robotnik's back at it, with a full-scale global disaster planned this time! He needs workers to create the ultimate doomsday machine, known as the Death Egg. So he's back to turning innocent animals into evil robots to create this ultimate weapon for him! The Eggman's already taken control of all the factories, refineries, and cities...but the seven Chaos Emeralds remain out of his grasp....Should he manage to capture them as well, he would have Mobius under an invincible grasp, and he'd never let go. It's up to Sonic the Hedgehog, along with his fox friend Miles "Tails" Prower, to stop Robotnik and collect the Chaos Emeralds before he does! Created November 24, 1992, this game blew Sonic 1 away! Twice as many zones, the awesome 3D pipe special stage, the ability to turn into Super Sonic, and the debut of that lovable fox, Miles "Tails" Prower....This game's zones set the standards for all other sonic zones in Sonic games consisting of the Emerald Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, Aquatic Ruin Zone, Casino Night Zone, Hill Top Zone, Mystic Cave Zone, Oil Ocean Zone, Metropolis Zone, Sky Chase Zone, Wing Fortress Zone, and the introduction of the deadliest weapons to ever enter the Sonic universe....Silver Sonic And The Death Egg!!!!

Whatever happened to the Death Egg after Sonic 2? After getting knocked out of the sky along with his entire Death Egg ship, Dr. Robotnik crash-landed on a mysterious Floating Island where he quickly meets Knuckles the Echidna, last of a lost civilization and guardian of the Floating Island - as well as a giant emerald better known as the mysterious "Master Emerald". The Eggman dupes Knuckles into thinking that Sonic and Tails are the bad guys, and learns that a giant Master Emerald keeps the island afloat. If he could get this Master Emerald, there would be no need for regular chaos emeralds as he would have a new source of Death Egg fuel - Forever! And while Knuckles is doing the rounds with Sonic and Tails, the Doc should have plenty of time to repair his Death Egg, as well as search for this Master Emerald.....Even though called Sonic 3 this is the fourth installment in his series of Sega Genesis games. This game was created in February 2, 1994, "Hedgehog" Day. The zones in this game may only be 2 acts, but the acts were twice as big as the ones in Sonic 2. Therefore there was a lot more to discover in this game. Just realize that if you're locking on Sonic and Knuckles you'll be heading over ground not mentioned in here sometimes. Doctor Robotnik has returned but this time he's not alone....this time he's brought Knuckles The Echidna and rebuilt his greatest invention - The Death Egg!!! Enjoy!

After knocking Robotnik's recently re-launched Death Egg back outta the sky before it even left the atmosphere, the explosion sent Sonic and Tails back down onto Floating Island. They landed deep in the Mushroom Hills, while the Death Egg crash-landed on the top of Floating Island's largest volcano. Now there is no choice: Robotnik needs the Master Emerald to get his Death Egg back up and running, and Sonic knows it. Knuckles, a bit peeved with all the trouble by this point, decides it's time to stop taking names and start handing out punishments. Little does he know that even though he won't be battling Robotnik - he'll face a foe just as deadly! Now it's a mad three-sided race to the Master Emerald, and there can only be one victor....Created in October 14, 1997, Sonic and Knuckles was a revolutionary game because it was the first (and only game so far) containing Lock On Technology, which gave it the ability to hook up to other games. In this case, you could plug Sonic 2 or 3 into the top of the Sonic and Knuckles cartridge to play as Knuckles in those games. It boosted Sonic 3 even farther, Knuckles traveled over new ground in some zones and now there were 14 emeralds. Because of there being 14, you could now access Ultra Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Super Tails. You can also stick Sonic and Knuckles in the Genesis and play it on its own. The zones are about the same size as the ones in Sonic 3, and most of them have 2 acts. Some only have 1. Like Sonic 3, there is a boss in every act, except for Hidden Palace Zone.

So just what is The Sonic World? Believe it or not - Sonic World is an example and incredible demo of what <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/6657/SonicXtreme.html">Sonic X-Treme</a> could have been....In Sonic World, you control a 3 dimensional Sonic the Hedgehog running around a small closed-in island surronded by mountains. Using the D-Pad, you can make Sonic run around the entire island with great animation. The Analog controller is even better here, letting you control the speed at which you want Sonic to walk or run. All around the courses there are different places to explore as well as many buildings are around for you to walk in. Take a look below to see what each building as well as some other extras have to offer...
