Sonic and Tails have temporarily parted for a little vacation time, and Tails has decided to visit his favorite holiday spot. It's a little island he discovered, and named it after himself: Tails Island! Problem is, there won't be much relaxing on this vacation. That's because a heavily-armed bird army is sweeping through the island! Suddenly there is a great noise, and the woods are suddenly ablaze! Tails sees a flying fortress hovering on the horizon and our two tailed hero isn't about to give up his island to some crazy army of birds, so armed at the start with nothing but simple bombs, Miles takes on the "Battle Bird Armada", with all the animals on the island counting on him! 
There is no time for guessing. As Tails, you must fight the Battle Bird Armada and stop the Battle Fortress from taking complete control of the island!</P></center>

<p><basefont size=2><font face="Comic Sans MS"><center><b>
On land, in the air, and at sea, you'll be battling some pretty tough birds! Several useful items are scattered throughout the island which you will need in your adventures. A platformer that plays absolutely nothing like traditional Sonic games, and has alot of action-RPG elements mixed in. It's a really fun game one way or the other, with an emphasis on collecting items and returning to old worlds to pick up stuff you couldn't get to the first time. There's also alot of puzzle-solving elements, figuring out which items to use for any given situation...this was the type of game the Game Gear was made for. There's also a spiffy music track in the game that's actually a less-annoying remix of Sonic 2's Aqua Lake Zone! The enemies look like various takes on The Ninja Crows from Samurai Pizza Cats, and the final boss looks like a fat version of Bean the Dynamite Duck. But dont be assuaded because this is an excellent game nonetheless!</P></center>

<B><p>Being a major switch from traditional Sonic games, Tails Adventure chooses to go the route of the puzzler over action. Infact, it might even be considered an action-RPG in 2D platformer style. (Anyone familiar with the Y's series or Popful Mail should know what I'm talking about.) 
Starting the game off, Tails has nothing more than Regular Bombs, a 10-hit power bar (hits being measured in Rings), and about two seconds on his Flight Guage. As the player travels through the game, he obtains a total of 26 weapons, about twelve seconds of flight time, and a 99-Ring power bar. Weapons are discovered hidden around levels, while power bar and Flight Guage are extended by discovering Chaos Emeralds (there are six in total), also hidden around the levels. 
As Tails' inventory increases, only four weapons can be brought into any level at a time. Often this presents a trial and error setup, requiring several trips into any one level to determine which four weapons need to be brought along for the trip. (The most useful items in the game tend to be the Triple Bomb, Remote Bomb, Remote Robot, and Teleport Device.) If you have any more detail to the levels that can be added, post it on Sonic HQ's forum or email me!

The 12 leves in detail are:</center>
<OL>
<LI>Tails' House -- Not really a level, this is where you start every game 
and equip, or switch to the Sea Fox.
<LI>Poloy Forest -- The first area attacked by the Bird Army, this flaming 
forest looks suspiciously like the inferno Robotnik made out of Angel Island.  
Simple design, and a good place to get used to Tails' various moves.
<LI>Volcanic Tunnel -- As the name suggests, it's an underground cavern 
flowing with magma.  The terrain's your worst enemy here, so expect more 
old-fashioned platforming than brain-teasing puzzles.
<LI>Polly Mountain 1 -- Here you're exploring the outside ledges of Polly 
Mountain.  This level's got a bit of everything, so keep on your toes.  
Notice the music is a re-vamped version of the Aqua Lake Zone tune (From 
Sonic 2 on Game Gear).
<LI>Caron Forest -- This eerily quiet jungle is a level of puzzles.  You're 
going to have to learn to use Tails' Remote Robot in some creative ways...
<LI>Green Island -- You're gonna have lots of bug trouble in this woodsy 
island.  You'll definitely want to pack along the Napalm Bomb, as it's the 
only way to destroy bee hives.
<LI>Cavern Island -- You'll need your Remote Robot and a good sense of 
direction to find your way through this massive maze...
<LI>Lake Rocky -- The first underwater level, this is a good place to get 
used to the Sea Fox's controls.  (Betcha didn't know the Remote Robot was 
the Sea Fox all along, didja?)
<LI>Lake Crystal -- You play salmon in this battle against the raging 
current from a waterfall.  The only way you'll make it over the cliffs is 
with the Extra Speed attachment.
<LI>Polly Mountain 2 -- Equip the remote bomb! Its a necessity!!! It's back to Polly Mountain, only this time you're 
exploring the inside.  The Night Vision goggles are a necessity, and 
remember...when you find yourself stuck under a bridge, use the Remote 
Bomb. Its one of the most ANNOYING challenges...
<LI>Coco Island -- There's more to this unusual island than meets the eye...
<LI>Battle Fortress 1 -- The Sea Fox takes to the air in this dogfight.  All 
you'll really need are adequate 2D shooter skills...
<LI>Battle Fortress 2 -- All of Tails' learned abilities will be put to the 
test in the final battle inside the Bird Army aircraft.  Pack along the 
Triple Bomb, the Remote Bomb, the Remote Robot, and the Wrench.
</OL>

<P><center>
And now here's a list of the game's 26 items and their individual effects:</center>
<OL>
<LI>Regular Bomb -- You start the game with these babies, and they're 
presumably Tails' key form of offense.  Blows up all enemies and your basic 
stone barriers.  
<LI>Large Bomb -- Destroys all on-screen enemies, but takes several seconds 
to detonate after placing.  Also useful for those stubborn, thick stone 
barriers.
<LI>Remote Bomb -- This handy little sucker will only detonate when you 
trigger it.  Not very effective against enemies, but a necessity on many 
puzzles.  Carry this item with you into nearly every level, as it's almost 
always needed...
<LI>Napalm Bomb -- Throw this puppy on the ground to create a wave of 
flame that destroys everything in its path, including objects above.  It's 
the only way to clear through tall grass.
<LI>Triple Bomb -- An enhanced version of the Regular Bomb.  Once you obtain 
this item, you'll never need the Regular Bombs again.  Naturally, being 
Tails' key form of offense, you'll need these in <i>every</i> level.
<LI>Wrench -- The final obtainable item in the game, the Wrench's only use 
comes in the final level, where you'll be using it to work machines and 
reverse the direction of conveyor belts.
<LI>Helmet -- By ducking under this giant bowl, all enemy fire will be 
reflected, and Tails will be safe from any damage.  Of course, you can't 
move at all while using it...
<LI>Remote Robot -- <b>THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEM IN THE GAME</b>, barring only 
the Regular and Triple Bombs.  Once you snag this mechanical pup, pack him 
along to <i>every</i> level.  90% of the game's puzzles revolve around 
maneuvering the robot to open the path for Tails himself, so learn this 
canine's tricks early.
<LI>Hammer -- Take out your frustrations on enemies and certain stone 
barriers with this fine mallet.  (Bean's bombs, Amy's mallet...what's next, 
Sonic's spin?)
<LI>Teleport Device -- This is a handy little item that should prove 
extremely useful while exploring new levels to determine what items you'll 
need to pack along, as well as when returning to old levels to pick up items 
you couldn't reach the first time.  Warps you back to Tails' House anytime.
<LI>Night Vision -- You'll need these infra-red goggles to light up dark 
levels.  I mean, unless you think you're good enough to play them in pitch 
black...
<LI>Speed Boots -- Anyone who's ever played a Sonic game in his life (and I 
don't think you'd be here if you haven't) should be familiar with this item.  
Gives Tails the ability to run, and fly at a faster speed.
<LI>Super Glove -- You can't have a self-respecting action-RPG without a 
Power Glove item, which naturally allows you to lift obscenely heavy 
objects.  It's yet to be explained exactly how wearing a glove raises a 
character's strength, but there are some questions better left unasked...
<LI>Fang -- Better known to US audiences as "Nack".  Everyone's favorite 
weasel gives Tails a lesson in Ring-pinching.  Carry this item along with 
you into any level to increase the chances that a destroyed enemy will drop 
a Ring.
<LI>Knuckles -- Bombs are OK, but sometime's it's just more satisfying to 
belt those bent birds' beaks in (there's a new tongue-twister for ya).  So 
make like everyone's favorite echidna and implant your fist into some face.
<LI>Sonic -- ...I had to say something.  Tails borrows Sonic's spin with 
this item, although the control is more like that of a slingshot.  Like 
Knuckles' punch, it's more of a cute series tie-in than a useful item.
<LI>Item Radar -- This time-saving piece of equipment will let you know if 
there's an item you missed still in the level.  If you don't get a read on 
the radar, don't waste your time.
<LI>Radio -- While completely useless to gameplay, this beat-buster is the 
game's only trace of a sound test.  It just so happens that you can continue 
the level while jamming to your choice of tune...
<LI>Proton Torpedo -- The Proton Torpedo is to the Sea Fox what the Regular 
Bombs are to Tails.  Your standard underwater weapon, they fire straight 
ahead.
<LI>Vulcan Gun -- A smaller, rapid-fire version of the Proton Torpedo.  This 
is particularly handy in the Battle Fortress dogfight...
<LI>Extra Speed -- Created solely for Lake Crystal, this boost-builder is 
the only way to get up that level's waterfalls.
<LI>Extra Armor -- A starry forcefield protects the Sea Fox, making it 
invincible as long as this item is selected.
<LI>Anti-air Missile -- This projectile shoots straight upward...handy for 
surprising enemies from below, and busting open barriers above.
<LI>Spark -- Creates a strong electrical field around the Sea Fox, clearing 
the screen of all enemies and mines.
<LI>Mine -- Like the Anti-air Missile, except you drop 'em below rather than 
shoot 'em upward.  Catch enemies from above, or destroy barriers directly 
below.
<LI>Rocket Booster -- This attachment allows the Sea Fox to fly...the only 
way to play Battle Fortress 1.
</OL>

<P>
Although it isn't in the traditional Sonic style, TA is a thoroughly 
enjoyable game by any rights, and a perfect way to kill a long car trip.  
The graphics and music are also top-notch by Game Gear standards.  It's a 
fair size for an 8-bit title, but that's still deathly short compared to 
the massive 16 and 32-bit RPG's we're used to playing.  My one major 
complaint is the time-consuming password feature, which would've been much 
more bearable as a save option.
