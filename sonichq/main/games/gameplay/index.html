<p align><b>What is a Choas Emerald? What do Power Rings do? Ever hear of a Blue Power Ring? Monitor Boxes? And what on earth is a Badnik?</p>
<p align> Welcome to the Sonic Gameplay section - one of our most extensive parts of the Games page and also a minimal part of what will become the new games list! We decided to compact all of the game play information into one general tips file, and here it is - describing what you can do in the games, what items you'll find, and how to use them, regular moves, signature moves, and the ONLY working list of Sonic Badniks on the net. These general game playing strategies will come in handy as you work your way through the various Sonic zones in the Sonic Games! Not only that, but these tips will apply to any Sonic game--including a working section on 3D gameplay ala Sonic Adventure & Sonic R--unless otherwise stated. So get started and let the Gameplay begin !!!

<p align><b>The majority of the Sonic games--the ones the ones we cover at Sonic HQ--are side-scrolling action games, A.K.A platform games. The biggest difference between Sonic and any other platform game is the fact that you can usually play with multiple characters, each with thier own storyline or controls, and you also usually acquire one or more weapons or necessary items in each of these levels - almost in an VERY LOOSE RPG fashion of sort, which adds some strategy to the way in which you play. </p>
<p align><b>Listed below are links to the various three topics covered in Sonic Gameplay. Split into 3 sections you will find Regular And Signature Moves, Weapons And Items, and the LARGEST and ONLY list of Sonic badniks on the net. In the future - when we work on the games list - certain things will be linked from one section to this section via "anchor links" for easy navigating! Happy searching !!!</p>
