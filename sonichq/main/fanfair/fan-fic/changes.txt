CYBER SONIC: EMERALD QUEST: PROLOGUE-CHANGES 

BY: KENNY HILLIS 

Timeline: Roughly 15-20 years from current Sonic continuity

Okay folks, I will honestly say I'm not a big fan of this part myself, and
I'm the author! But it had to be done in order to set up the rest of the
series. Trust me, it will get MUCH better. So give me a chance, please. I
will now give you a brief history of Cyber Sonic folowed by the
characters.

HISTORY: The story begins many years ago when the characters we know and
love got married and had kids. Many years had passed when Robotnik
returned, with a machine called the Atomic Splitter. Robotnik then
proceeded in attacking the Floating Island. The Freedom Fighters had heard
of this and tried to stop him. With the help of Super Sonic, Hyper
Knuckles, Turbo Tails, and Ultra Jewel, they where able to save most of
the residents of the Island and finaly defeat Robotnik, unfortunately, at
the cost of the Island. With the Island destroyed, Knuckles, Julie-Su, and 
the residents of the Island moved to an expanded Mobotropolis. Eleven years 
later, Sonic and his son Speed found a chest full of what looked to be small 
Chaos Emeralds. After further study of the ancient text, they discovred them 
to be Cyber Emeralds, gems that granted their owner powerful battle armor.
It was just in time too, because Robotnik had returned. He hired Nack to steal 
the emeralds. He got most of them, but the FF's had secured a good amount of 
them for an emergency. The new battle raged on for a few years, until Robotnik's 
final attack, devastating most of Mobotropolis. The FF's chased him to the
remains of the Floating Island, where the final battle ensued. During the
fight, Sonic was forced to do one of the hardest things he's ever had to
do..... kill Robotnik. In his passing, he released a energy wave severely
draining all Cyber Emeralds within a five mile radius. Recently in the
kids' battle with Enerjak, he revealed that Mandy had great hidden powers.

Place: Acorn Castle-Uncle Chuck's Lab 

"What!" Sonic said. He was shocked at what he just heard. 

"The Cyber Emerald's power has been drained," Charles said. "After the battles against 
Robotnik and Enerjack and cleaning up Mobotropolis from Robotnik's final attack, they've 
been drained."
     
"All of 'em?" Sonic said. 

"Yes," Charles said. 

"But," Sally spoke up, seeing her husband was too agitated to speak, "we still have Nack's 
Gang, The Dark Legion, Cemator, and The Tribe to deal with. Normally it wouldn't be so bad,
but most of them have access to Cyber Emeralds, and we've learned the only way to fight 
Cyber Emeralds is with Cyber Emeralds. What are we supposed to do?" 

Charles looked at the two of them, and then looked down. "I don't know." 

***** PLACE: Mobotropolis Int. Speedway 

Basher Echidna held up the starter gun. "On your mark..."

Speed, Crystal, Duo, and Comet tensed up.

"Get set..." 

Mandy, Lara-Su, and Jessica were on the sidelines. 

"GO!" 

Basher fired the gun,and the four of them where off. The ten mile race was over in a 
matter of minutes. It was a tie again. As the four argued over who won, Sally came up. 

"Kids," she said, "I have something to tell you."

     *****

PLACE: Castle Acorn War Room

"What I don't get, Mom," Speed said to Sally, "is why we even need the
Cyber Emeralds."

Sonic, Sally, and Uncle Chuck had gathered all of the Feedom Fighters in
the war room. Knuckles, Julie-Su, Mighty, Kelly, Vector, Espio,
Antoine, Bunnie, Tails, Jewel, Rotor, Dulcy, Uncle Chuck, Speed, Crystal,
Duo, Comet, Basher, Lara-Su, Mandy, Jessica, Amy and Cristie Rose, Sonic 
and Sally where either sitting or standing around the war room.

"Well," Sally said, "a certain number of our enemies have access to the
emeralds and we don't...."

"And we don't stand a chance against them without emeralds of our own," Sonic cut in.

"Nicole," Sally said, "Search files for opponents with access to Cyber Emeralds."

"SEARCHING, SALLY," Nicole said. After a couple of moments, Nicole
started, "NACK WEASEL AND HIS GANG HAS POSSESSION OF 10 CYBER
EMERALDS. THE TRIBE HAS 3 CYBER EMERALDS IN THEIR POSSESSION. THE DARK
LEGION HAS 4 CYBE...."

"Nicole, I think you need to update your files," Knuckles
interrupted. "Ever since Kragok retired and Cronan took over, the DL
hasen't attacked us, except fora couple of broken away fractions."

"SORRY, KNUCKLES," Nicole said, "NOW LET ME CONTINUE. SNIVELY HAS POSSESSION
OF AN UNDETERMINABLE AMOUNT OF EMERALDS. THAT IS ALL."

Sonic was about to speak up when there was a brilliant flash of light
that blinded everyone in the room in the room for a moment. A being
cloaked in white robes floated down to the floor hovering a foot above.

"W-wh-who-what-are you?" Sally asked.

The being spoke with a hood covering its face. "I am the Knowing
One." The voice was female. "And I have come to warn you of an evil only
the Cyber Emeralds can stop." Somehow they could sense the truth in her
voice.

"But," Crystal said, "We only have four....."

The Knowing One put her hand on Sonic's head. A jumble of images flashed
through his head. He saw six gems, a frozen tundra, an underground cavern, a
fortress, and a plummeting space station. Sonic came out of his trance to
find a red gem in his hand. The Knowing One spoke. "This is the Fire Cyber
Emerald. It will restore your Emerald with more power than it had
before. There are five others on and near Mobius. You must find them, your
planet depends on it. I must now leave. I will return soon." She disappeared.

"How do we know we can trust her?" Sally asked.

"We can trust her," Sonic said. "We need to look for them."

"Where?" Sally asked.

"The Frozen Tundra."
