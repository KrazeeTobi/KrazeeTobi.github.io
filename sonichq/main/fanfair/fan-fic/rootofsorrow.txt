Root  of  Sorrow    by    Blue9Tiger


What  peril  lies  within  that  dark  city
For  fools  who  blaze  its  shadowy  alleys
And  defy  the  terror  running  freely  
Under  every  stone  and  atop  every  roof!
They  face  death  and  despair
Of  themselves  and  their  allies
Of  their  closest  kin
Each  time  they  enter.
Not  only  wounds  of  flesh  do  they  face,
For  if  they  meet  their  subdued  in  the  city,
Oh,  the  tears  that  will  fall,
Oh,  the  grief  that  will  be  beared,
Sorrow  for  their  destroyed  own  that  have  turned  from  them.
What  peril  awaits  for  the  one  who  enters  the  root  of  sorrow!
