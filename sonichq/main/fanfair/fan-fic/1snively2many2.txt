One Snively Too Many II
by Sniper

      "By the freakin' Ancient Walkers on a bicycle! It’s a freaking
WARZONE here, Sniv!" Nack yelled, as three more blasts just hit the
wall above him.  

	"All the more reason to hurry up with the device!" Sniv
yelled back.  Suddenly, an eggbot fired at the two. The shot just missed
them, but the force of the blast threw them behind a garbage pile,
seperating the two from the doorway device!  The eggbot lowered itself
from the air, and landed right in front of the device.

	"STRANGE RADIATION SIGNATURE. TAKE TO MR. SNIVELY," The robot 
droned aloud. 

	"Sniv, we can’t let that thing get the device!" Knack whispered.  

	"I know!  Let’s get it!"

	 Nack and Sniv both pulled out their blasters from out of thier coats, 
and stood up to fire at the eggbot.  

	"Hold it right there, dirtbag!" A voice said from behind them. Both spun
around, to see a rather angry-looking group of Mobians, all with blasters trained on
them.  A particularly mean-looking bulldog aimed his gun at Sniv’s head.
"Now you're going to call off this attack, or else I’m going to carry out the sentence
you should have gotten!"
