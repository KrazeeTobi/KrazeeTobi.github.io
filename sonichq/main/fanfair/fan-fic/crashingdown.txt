The hurricane came to the island
The people knew they were in trouble
The gaurdian was unable to help
He couldn't calm the sea

The people fled the island
So far up in the sky, it was
But it soon fell to the mercy of the wind
The Guardian could not calm the sea

The island fell to the water below
It shattered into little bits
The people died and the Guardian wept
His life was destroyed by nature

The Guardian flew to land nearby
To cry on a friend's shoulder
He found they too had fled the area
Now he was alone

He searched far and wide to find a friend
But all he found was earth
He found his friends high on a mountain
Climbing to higher ground

A flood they said was coming
But an earthquake came first
His friends fell, he knew at once
On the jagged rocks below they rest

The Guardian searched far and wide
But he saw nothing but the earth and sea
Damn the earth! Damn the sea!
Life isn't always beautiful
