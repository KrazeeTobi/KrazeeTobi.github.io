A Gal Like me needs mo than jus a gah like 'Twan
Ah need more than jus a coupl'a friends
Ah feel that ah was meant to be mo
Mo than jus a half roboticized bunny
Ah got stahs directin' mah futuah
Stahs that shon like the metal on mah hide
Mah face'll nevah be the same

Oh, Ma cherrie, do no' be crying
I Antoine DeCollette shall protect 'oo
Bunnie dearest, 'oo mean zee wurld to moi
I love 'oo zo much, do no' cry sweetest
I will take 'oo 'ome and vee shall be togethair
Bunnie, Weel 'oo mary moi? I love 'oo zo much
I nevair was thoughting that I vould zay zat too anyone
