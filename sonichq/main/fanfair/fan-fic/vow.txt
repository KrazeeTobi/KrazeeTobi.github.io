Snively's Vow
By A.M. Fleury

Beaten, bruised, bled...shattered
This punishment is not taken lightly
Each bruise, each drop of blood 
Might seem a small thing to you
But it ferments inside me
Dark and black, tight like a spring
My anger
My hatred
Towards you

And I think
I could take you out so easily
Because you might be suspicious
But you're not too suspicious
I'll put the knife in your back
The gun to your head
Do you think I can't pull the trigger?
Oh dear Uncle Julian, 
You're so dead wrong.
