 The following is a poem. It's a rhyming poem about Sally and Julie-Su
protesting against bashing and Sega's rules.   The title is:


  "What Do They Have Against Us?"  

Sally:  What do most Sonic fans have against us?

Julie-Su:  If I knew better, I'd say they would rather see us get hit
by a bus!

Sally:  I think I know why they all hate you and I.

Julie-Su:  Because a lot of boys like us, and for that they think we're
sluts!

Sally:  Right!  If they think that, then they don't have no guts!

Julie-Su: Who do they want Sonic's and Knux's girlfriends to be?

Sally:  I don't know.  For Sonic, maybe Amy!

Julie-Su: Or Hershey, Bunnie, or Lupe!

Sally:  If those Sonic fans that hate us think that, we don't care
anyway!

Julie-Su:  Right!  Besides those Sonic fans and Sega reps who hate us
think we don't deserve to have an S.O. (Short for Siginificant other). 

Sally:  That's Sega's fault, really!  Archie should give their rules
the heave-ho!

Julie-Su:  No matter what they do or what they say....

Sally:  We're Sonic and Knuckles' girlfriends! We're not Sega
characters!  Like us or not, and we're here in the comic books for a
looooong time to stay!!!!

Sally & Julie-Su (together): (Giving each other a high-five)  WE RULE,
Sega's rules and bashings DROOL!
