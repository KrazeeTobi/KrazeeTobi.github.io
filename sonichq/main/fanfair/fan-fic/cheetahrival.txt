A Cheetah's  Rival      by  Blue9Tiger

The  fiery  pride  those innumerable golden  winds  held  has  weakened
And  blown  away.
They  vaguely,  in  a  blur,  know  why  it  did.  
Somewhere  beyond  Earth
Lies  a  greater  speed  than  they  possess,
And  they  must  keep  the  answer  concealed,
For  fear  of  weakening the  rest.  
It's  fortunate  that  the  winds  know  not  who  is  swifter  than  they,
For  how  would  they  react,  
If  the  one  with  much  speed  and  tact,
Was  a  mere  rodent  that  could  react
To  danger  quicker  than  they?
All  their  pride  would  be  crushed
At the  sight  of  this  being.
Their  lives  would  mean  less  than  a  cracked  doorknob.
That  is  why  the  winds  never  smile,
And  are  always  deep  in  thought
Of  their  rival  who  holds  
The  unattainable  speed,
And  unknown  to  them,
A  mere  blue  hedgehog.

Note:  For  those  who  did  not  get  one  word  of  this:
I  compared  cheetahs  on  Earth  to  winds  because  they  are  both  fast,  first  of  all.  
Cheetahs  are  the  fastest  on  Earth,  but  Sonic  is  faster  on  Mobius.
So,  that's  what  I  mean  with  a  cheetah's  rival.  
The  other  things  are   minor.  In the  poem,  the  cheetahs  were  to  meet  Sonic,
they  would  be  ashamed  because  they  thought  they  were  the  fastest,  but  they  were  not.
If  all  the  cheetahs  knew  this,  they  all  would  be  embarrased  or  jealous.
Get  it?  I  know  it's  abstract.  Oh,  well.
