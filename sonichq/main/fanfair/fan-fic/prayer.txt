        This is a war that we must win.

        The enemy has power on his side.
        And we have power, as well.

        But we are being beaten, one by one.
        We are made his slaves whenever we are unsuccessful in stopping him.
        Some have given up hope and surrendered themselves to him already.

        Terror comes through the night,
        And courage through the day.
        A quest to regain what is rightfully ours.
        We are the true peoples of this land.

        We ask a hero to step forward;
        We ask him to save us.
        Sonikku, Being of the Ancient Times,
        Great Shaper of the happenings of the Universe,
        Let us win.

        Send down a hero to guide us.
        To protect us and lead us to victory;
        To bring us to that which we seek:
        A Universe more perfect than it was.
        The One who you choose makes no difference,
        As long as he is the One.

        Ancient Walkers, Chaota, Demonix:
        Whoever hears this, please answer.
        Give us the hero we now need;
        Give us the freedom we want so badly.
        Give us back the planet of our birth.

        Fear is ever present,
        Can't you hear us;
        See our fear?
        All that we ask is the power.

        Defeat of the Cursed One.
        The one who turned on his own people.
        The one who betrayed us, as well.

        We are but children struggling to regain what our parents lost.
        And struggling to regain our parents, as well.

        Let your Chosen One come forth.
