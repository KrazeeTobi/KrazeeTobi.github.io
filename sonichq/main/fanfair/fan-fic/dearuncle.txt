How lovely you are, Uncle Julian, dear,
Eyes like a frog's that do appear.
The shape of your head is like Major Cass,
No, no, no, more like the head of Boss Nass!

Your voice so sweet, like that of a mule,
As that French brat would say, "Zat is a fu-el!"
A smile from you would cause great joy,
A happy child face turned into that of a toy.

Your eyes are red, like that of a rose,
Ah, it goes beautifully with your hooked nose.
Your suit is red, like that of a king!
("More like the blood your hands bear, you insignificant THING!")

The size of your body is caused by rippling muscles!
("More like because you ate too many mussels!")
Your superior brain, which controls the planet,
Ah, its size is like that of a great hornet!

Your moustache, uncle, is of a noble colour,
("Pale orange, like the beggars near the ice-cream parlour!")
Your face is pink, which shows your state of health,
("Caused by drinking too much no doubt, depleting your wealth!")

Your role-models, whose faces hang on your wall,
Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and the great King Saul!
Darth Sidious, Pol Pot and the largest picture awaits,
Oh, who can forget, the noble William Henry Gates!

Oh, Uncle dear, how I'll miss you most,
With you warped to another dimesion, ah yes, I'll take your post!
Don't worry about me, Uncle, hell.. err, heaven awaits!
("Haha, all the world will bow before Snively the Great!")

Goodbye, Uncle, but for you we can't wait,
For we believe not that you can reincarnate.
Your judgement day has come, oh great boar!
Which will open? The gates or the trap door?
