Plant  Before  Blooming      by  Blue9Tiger


Tails  is  a  plant  before   blooming.
Unnoticed  as  its  seeds  take  root,
Reaching  deep  into  the  soil.
Unnoticed  as  its  stem  perks  up,
Reaching  towards  the  glowing  ball  of  fire.
Unnoticed  as  its  leaves  branch  off,
Spreading  towards  the  east  and  west,
North  and  south,
As  far  as  they  can  touch.
Unnoticed   as  its  stem  grows   farther   to  the  glowing  fire,
Unleashing  its  amazing  qualities  over  few
Who   notice  it  before  it's  fully   in  bloom.
Unnoticed  as  its  flower  finally  peeks,
Spreading   when  the   fire   embraces  it.
Unnoticed  when  the  flower  spreads  more,
But  finally  noticed  when  the  flower  is  full,
When  it  is  bright  and   strong
And   it  can  grow  no  more.
Now  it  awes  everyone,
And  no  one's  eye  fails  to  see,
The  beauty  of  the  plant,
That  once  was  a  mere  seed  in  the  soil.

Oh,  how  Tails  wishes  to  be  a  plant  fully  bloomed.
