Title: Search for the Guardian's Daughter
Authors: Noele Carballo and Ru Griffin (aka T2 and Syna-Eve)


        It had been a quiet day on the Floating Island. Knuckles and his wife, 
Julie-Su, were relaxing in the Mushroom Hill Zone, taking advantage of the 
peaceful setting. The Guardian lay back on the grass, closing his eyes, 
Julie-Su nestled against him.
        Laughter reached his ears, and he cracked open his eyes, watching his 
daughter, Lara-Su, playing happily with the Lina-T ball only a few feet 
away. Knuckles smiled, content. This was the life . . .
        Lina-T floated over to Knuckles. "It sure has been peaceful around here for 
the past few weeks, Guardian," she said, reflecting his exact thoughts.
        "Thank the Walkers!" he replied, stretching and putting an arm around 
Julie-Su, pulling her close. "I think we've had enough excitement after that 
last battle to last us all a lifetime . . ."
        Lara-Su, chasing an errant butterfly, tripped over a rock and was nearly 
sent sprawling. She managed an "oops!" before righting herself.
        "Careful, honey!" Julie-Su called.
        "Don't worry, Momma!" Lara flashed a bright smile, dusting herself off. 
"I'm careful!"
        Julie smiled back. "Just watch yourself."
        Knuckles stood. "Lara, how do you feel about an impromptu gliding lesson?"
        "Gliding . . .?" Lara's smile widened. "You mean I can finally learn how to 
fly?" Knuckles nodded. "YAY!" Lara threw her arms around his neck in 
excitement, then turned to Julie-Su. "Did you hear that, Momma? I get to 
learn to fly just like Daddy! Isn't that cool?"
        Julie-Su chuckled, winking. "Very cool."
        Knux bent down. "Ready to start?"
        "Yup!" Lara nodded eagerly.
        "Let me explain how it works." Knuckles paused, trying to think of the best 
way to explain Guardian powers to his daughter, and opted for the simplest 
one. "All Guardians have a special connection to the Chaos Emerald's energy. 
All Guardian powers are derived from that connection-including flying. All 
you have to do to fly is tell the energy what you want to do."
        "Now, relax and close your eyes."
        Lara obeyed. "Like this?" she queried, eyes tightly shut.
        "Good," Knuckles responded, doing the same. "You feel that spot of energy, 
near your middle?"
        "Yeah . . ."
        "That's your connection. Now, just concentrate . . ." he began to rise, 
"and up you go!"
        Lara shut her eyes even tighter, concentrating very hard. "Am I flying?"
        Her father chuckled. "Why don't you open your eyes and look?"
        Lara-Su cracked open one eye, then the other, to see that she was hanging 
suspended above the ground . . . with nothing holding her up! "I'm doing 
it!" she exclaimed. "I'm flying!" She turned. "Momma, do you see me? I'm 
flying!"
        Julie applauded. "I see you, Lara, I see you!"
        "This is so great!" Lara glided down, landing gently on the grass. "I can't 
wait to show the Jr. Chaotix that I can fly!"
        Knuckles landed beside her. "Lara," he began warningly, "I only want you to 
use your powers when you need them. Showing off in front of your friends 
doesn't count."
        Lara-Su looked downhearted. "Aww . . ." she started to protest, but 
Knuckles cut her off, chucking her under the chin.
        "However . . ." he winked, "you do need to practice . . ."
        Lara brightened. "Cool! Thanks, Daddy!" She whirled, launching into the 
air. "I'm gonna go shower, practice right now!"
        "All right," Knuckles called, waving goodbye to his daughter as she flew 
out of sight.

        Jammer, the son of Vector Crocodile, dribbled the basketball across the 
court, blocked by Rex, Rocky, and Nage—Ray, Mighty, and Espio's sons, 
respectively. He evaded them all easily and took a leap into the air, firing 
the ball into the air at the peak of his jump. "All right, he shoots . . ." 
Jammer announced. The ball sailed through the air, falling through the 
middle of the hoop with a swish.
        "HE SCORES!" Jammer landed and pumped one fist in the air.
        "Hey, guys!" came Lara-Su's voice. "Look at me!"
        The Jr. Chaotix, as the group was known, turned as one and gazed at their 
friend as she glided down into the clearing.
        "Whoa!"
        "Lara-Su!"
        "You're flying!"
        Lara-Su landed, grinning from ear to ear. "Yep! Daddy taught me how to fly 
today!"
        "Well, I can already fly, since my dad is a flying squirrel," said Rex, 
proudly, and the others rolled their eyes.
        "Yeah, yeah," they responded in unison. "We know, Rex, we know!"
        "Hey, Lara, can you carry people while you're flying?" Rocky asked.
        "Umm . . . I don't know," Lara admitted. "I'd better not try. I only just 
learned, after all . . ."
        Rocky nodded. "Okay, no problem." He smiled.
        Knuckles, Ray, and Lina-T suddenly glided down into the clearing.
        "Dad!"
        "Daddy!"
        Lara and Rex ran to greet their parents, hugging them tightly. "Been 
practicing?" Knuckles asked Lara, who nodded.
        "Yes, sir," she responded cheerfully.
        "Showing off is more like it," Ray joked.
        Knuckles smiled. "C'mon, Lara-Su, it's time to go home now," he said, 
turning.
        "Okay, Daddy." The two took off, accompanied by Lina-T, calling goodbye to 
their friends as they headed into the air.

        They had been flying for only a short time when Lara piped up. "Daddy, can 
I carry people when I'm flying?"
        "I wouldn't try it," Knuckles responded. "It's too risky until you've 
practiced more. You should practice on inanimate objects first."
        "Inanimate objects?"
        "Or how about Lina-T?" Knuckles nodded towards the catlike droid. "If you 
drop her by accident, she'll float!"
        "Okay!" Lara eagerly scooped the willing Lina-T into her arms and held her 
as she flew. "See, I can do it!" she exclaimed at the same moment Lina 
slipped from her grasp. "Oops . . ."
        "It's all right," Knuckles assured her as Lina floated beside them. "You'll 
get used to it."
        The two echidnas swooped down towards their home in Rainbow forest. 
Knuckles landed first, smiling. Julie had decided to walk home after 
Knuckles had gone to get Lara. He looked towards his house, expecting to see 
her there, waiting . . . then gasped in horror.
        A Dark Legion hovercraft was parked on the grass outside their home.
        As Lara landed, she looked up to see her father dashing towards the house. 
The look on his face was unreadable, but it frightened her. "Daddy?" she 
whispered, then followed him.
        Knuckles slipped inside the house, Lara close after him. "Daddy?" she 
called, a frantic edge building in her tone. "Daddy, what's wrong?!"
        She emerged into the living room, to find it a wreck. There were blaster 
marks on the walls, and much of the furniture had been destroyed. "Wha--?" 
Lara stammered, eyes wide.
        Her father was standing in the center of the ravished room, unmoving. *The 
house . . . in shambles!* he thought. *But that just can't be! It's not 
possible . . .! Is it?*
        Lara-Su, standing beside her stunned father, caught a glimpse of something 
out of the corner of her eye. She turned around slowly.
        Her eyes widened.
        "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!"
        Knuckles whirled around at her cry to see a dark shadow looming over his 
daughter. He leapt in front of her, shielding her. A low growl emanated from 
his throat. "Who are you?!"
        "Why, my dear Knuckles . . . don't you remember me?"
        Before Knuckles could reply, the shadow deposited another figure at his 
feet. With horror and anger, he recognized the battered, unconscious form of 
Julie-Su . . .
        "Momma!" Lara cried, but Knuckles was already on his knees.
He cradled his wife in his arms. "No! Julie!"
No response.
He lifted his eyes to the figure, a snarl contorting his features, but 
gasped in shock as it pulled back its hood. A single cybernetic eye glared 
from the all-too-familiar face as it twisted into a demented smile.
        "Kragok!"
        The Legionnaire chuckled. "Weren't expecting me, were you, Guardian?"
        Still cradling Julie, Knuckles glared at the Grandmaster. "What do you 
want, Kragok?!" he demanded. "I settled with you years ago . . . for good!"
        Lara hid behind her father, whimpering. "Daddy, I'm scared!"
        "Don't worry, sweetie," Knuckles replied. He put his arms around her, never 
taking his eyes off of Kragok. "It'll be okay."
        "Is this the little one?" Kragok asked, gazing at Lara-Su intently. "Yes, I 
suppose she is . . ."
        Knuckles snarled. "You didn't answer my first question, Kragok—why have you 
come here?"
        "Why, I should think it obvious!" Kragok chuckled. "I came for the child."
        Lara-Su gasped, shutting her eyes, and Knuckles held her tighter. "NEVER!" 
he shouted.
        "Oh," Kragok snapped his fingers casually, "I doubt that . . ."
        The two suddenly found themselves surrounded by Dark Legionnaires. Lara 
began to cry, trembling. "Daddy, don't let them take me . . ." she pleaded, 
terrified.
        "I won't . . . I promise." Knuckles kissed the top of her head, holding her 
close.
        "How touching," Kragok snapped sarcastically as the Legion troops closed 
in. "Now, just stand still. Don't make this any harder than it has to be . . ."
        Knuckles struck, fast and hard, landing a sharp punch to the nearest 
Legionnaire's jaw, fending them off as well as he could. Despite his 
efforts, however, one of the Legionnaires grabbed Lara's wrist.
        The Legionnaire grinned, pulling her close as Lara struggled desperately. 
"No! No! Let me go!"
        Lina-T, seeing her mistress in danger, retaliated. She slammed into the 
face of the one holding Lara. The force of impact caused the Legionnaire to 
lose his grip, and he staggered backwards. Lara took her opportunity to 
flee, darting out the door, followed closely by Lina-T.
        "Run, Lara!" Knuckles called. "Get help-unh!" His words were cut short as a 
Legionnaire shot him from behind. He slumped to the ground, motionless.
        "Don't just stand there, you fools!" Kragok thundered. "AFTER HER! And make 
sure she's unharmed!"

        Lara burst out of the door at the same moment that the sky let loose with a 
torrent of rain. The young girl was instantly drenched, but she kept 
running, thinking, *I got to get help!*
        "Uncle Mighty!" she screamed. "Uncle Espio! Uncle Vector! Uncle Ray! HELP 
ME!"
        The Legionnaires were right after her. "There she is!" one called, 
pointing. "She's running into the forest!" He raised his blaster, leveling 
it at Lara's retreating form.
        A second Legionnaire knocked the blaster from his hands. "You idiot! Kragok 
wants her unharmed!"
        "Too bad I can't say the same for you!" came a voice from behind them. The 
two whirled around in time to see Mighty Armadillo swing down from a nearby 
tree, kicking them both to the ground.
        "Uncle Mighty!" Lara-Su gasped, starting to turn around, but Mighty waved 
her off.
        "Keep goin', kiddo!" he shouted. "Run! I'll hold them off as long as I can!"
        Lara and Lina-T obeyed, fleeing farther into the forest. Suddenly, a dark 
figure materialized in front of them. Lara pulled back, eyes widening with 
fear, but the figure became the smiling form of Espio the Chameleon. He 
leaned down and scooped her up. "Hey, little gal," he said kindly. "Let's get 
you outta here."
        He began to run through the rain, lightning flashing overhead. "The others 
are fighting the Legion," he explained, "but I'll have you outta here in no 
time."
        Lara clung to him gratefully. "Thank-you, Uncle Espio . . . but what about 
Momma and Daddy?"
        "I don't know, kiddo . . ." Espio admitted grimly. "We're kinda playing by 
ear . . . URGH!" He fell to the ground as a laser bolt struck his back.
        "Espio!" Lina T-cried in alarm.
        Lara tumbled from Espio's arms, falling flat into the mud. Two Legionnaires 
descended on her immediately, grabbing her and striving to hold her still.
        "Let me go!" Lara cried. She kicked them both, making them drop her. She 
hit the ground running, only to find her path blocked.
        A tall Legionnaire, almost entirely cybernetic, grinned down at her. Lara 
recognized him from the stories her father told her . . . Xenin!
        Xenin chuckled. "I don't think so, little girl." As the Lina-T ball charged 
at him, he swung a fist at it, slamming it against a tree. It fell, eyes 
flickering out. Xenin bent down, grabbing the frightened and angry Lara-Su 
from the ground. "Our master would like a word with you . . ."
        "I don't think so!" Lara shot back, slamming her spiked fist into Xenin's 
face. Xenin dropped her, rubbing his face and growling.
        Before Lara could make a move to run, Xenin lunged at her, striking at her 
with one metallic fist. "Why you little BRAT!" he raged, slamming her into a 
tree in much the same manner he'd treated Lina-T. Lara hit with a sickening 
crack, then slumped to the ground, lifeless.
        Xenin paused, breathing hard. Rain continued to pour from the sky as he 
walked slowly towards Lara. He knelt in the mud, picking her up carefully 
and examining the growing bruise on the back of her head. He cursed, softly, 
muttering, "Kragok is not going to like this." Nodding to the other 
Legionnaires, he said, "Let's go."

        Inside the house, Kragok was ranting. "I said she was to be unharmed!" he 
snarled, Xenin cringing from his fury.
        "But, Lord Kragok," he protested, "it was either that or letting her 
escape!"
        Kragok sighed, exasperated. "Fine then! Chain her and let's get back to 
camp. The Guardian-child and I have business to discuss."
        Xenin cleared his throat. "And . . . these, my Lord?" he asked, indicating 
the unconscious Knuckles and Chaotix team, who were sprawled on the floor.
        "Chain them and leave them," Kragok replied. "By the time they awaken, 
we'll be long gone!"
        Lina-T could only watch from the shadows of the forest as several Dark 
Legion hovercrafts took off from the grounds outside the house, heading 
west.

        "It's a nasty wound, sir," said the Legion medic known as Pela-Ni, 
examining the still-unconscious Lara-Su. "We'll have to wait and see if she 
wakes up on her own."
        Almost an hour had passed since they had kidnapped the child and brought 
her back to the Legion encampment, and she still showed no sign of 
awakening. Kragok swore under his breath, clenching a fist. Xenin was going 
to get the dressing-down of his life . . . The Grandmaster stormed out, on 
the warpath.
        Pela-Ni sighed, watching him go, then turned her attention back to Lara-Su. 
She stood up and took a blanket down from a nearby shelf, then sat beside 
Lara, wrapping the blanket around her shoulders. "Poor little thing," she 
murmured, cleaning a sizeable gash on the back of Lara's head. She shook her 
head, sighing. "Xenin . . . that ruffian! I'd hate to be in his shoes when 
Kragok gets hold of him!"
        Lina-T, watching from the shadows, took off without the medic noticing, 
heading back into the Rainbow Forest. She had to tell the Guardian . . .

        Knuckles awoke slowly, blinking. Where was he . . .?
        Suddenly, it all came back to him. Lara, the kidnapping . . . had she 
gotten away? He tried to get up, but found his legs and arms shackled and 
bound with heavy chain. He struggled with the shackles, but they were too 
strong, even for him. Looking around, he saw his wife and the Chaotix all 
around him, all shackled as well. But if they hadn't saved Lara . . .
        The others slowly came to as a familiar shape flew in through a broken 
window. Lina-T!
        "Guardian, I know where they're keeping Lara," she said quickly.
        Knuckles continued to struggle with the chains that bound him. "Where? Tell 
me, quickly!
        "They're at their camp at the other side of the forest . . . but Lara . . ." Lina's 
voice trailed off and she looked down.
        "What about Lara?" Knuckles asked, a frantic edge to his voice. "Tell me, 
Lina-T!"
        Lina hesitated. "I'm . . . I'm afraid . . . she's hurt badly, Guardian . . ."
        Knuckles' face turned ashen.
        "I'm so sorry," said Lina softly. "There was nothing I could do at the time 
. . ."
        Knuckles closed his eyes, as though in deep pain. "No . . . Lara . . ." he 
whispered. He stayed there for only a moment, trembling with rage, then his 
eyes flew open. They blazed with fury, and Knuckles stood, breaking the 
chains around himself and the others as though they were nothing at all. He 
panted heavily, fists clenched to his sides.
        "The Legion will pay dearly," he hissed, snarling, then turned to Lina-T. 
"Take me to the camp, Lina-T . . . NOW!"

        "You FOOL!" Kragok fumed. "The child is more important than anything else 
on this planet! The Chaos Emeralds themselves cannot hold to her power!"
        "But, sir, I-" Xenin tried to break in, Kragok cutting him off.
        "If you weren't my best soldier, I'd have you executed! The child is too 
important to be trusted to incompetents!"
        "Lord Kragok, please-"
        "Silence!" Kragok whirled on him, cybernetic claw upraised. "Out of my 
sight, you idiot!"
        Xenin slunk out of the tent, head lowered, and Kragok sank down into his 
desk chair. "That fool . . ." he muttered. "He doesn't realize the true 
scope of my plans for the Guardian-child . . ." His mind swirled with images 
of his grand and glorious plan. "Her power is greater than that of even her 
father! With time, she could be persuaded to work for us-one so young is 
easily manipulated. With the power of a Guardian on our side, nothing could 
stop the Legion! We could conquer the Floating Island, the whole of Mobius! 
The possibilities are endless . . ." He snapped out of it, slightly. "But 
all will be for naught, thanks to Xenin." He snarled, getting up and heading 
out of his tent, headed towards the medical area. "I only pray she's all 
right . . ."

        "I don't see anyone here," Rocky whispered.
        He and the other Jr. Chaotix were searching for their families, and their 
search had led them to the Dark Legion camp. They shivered as they glanced 
around the apparently deserted camp.
        "Maybe our parents and Lara-Su aren't around here," Rex suggested 
nervously.
        "Yeah, but where else can they be?" Nage wondered. "We've looked 
everywhere!"
        They were so engaged in their argument that they didn't notice the two 
Legionnaires who appeared silently behind them. One lunged forward, and made 
the mistake of grabbing Rocky.
        Rocky shouted in protest. "HEY!" The others whirled at his shout and 
gasped.
        "Gotcha, you little twerps!" one grinned. He turned to the other. "Call 
Kragok! We got ourselves a bunch of intruders!"
        Rocky snarled, gripping the Legionnaire who had caught him and lifting him 
up, tossing him into the second Legionnaire. "Take THAT!" he growled.
        The Legionnaires tumbled in a heap. One groaned, grabbing a radio from his 
belt. "Assistance required, sector seven," he managed. "Intruder alert!"
        "Time for a lil' rock an' roll," said Jammer, grinning. He turned up the 
volume of his walkman full blast. "SONIC BOOM!" he yelled, blasting the 
Legionnaires out of the way.
        "Run, everyone!" Rex cried. The Jr. Chaotix scattered, running as fast as 
they could. They vanished just as Kragok arrived.
        "What in Dimitri's name--?" Kragok demanded, gaping at the damage.
        The Jr. Chaotix, meanwhile, had stumbled into the same tent that Lara was 
being held. Not noticing the medic or Lara behind them, they huddled just 
inside the tent.
        "Did they see us?" Rocky whispered, as they peered out of the tent flap, 
watching as the two Legionnaires they'd fought stood up shakily.
        "Attack, sir . . ." one said. "The Junior Chaotix."
        Kragok clenched a fist. "Don't just stand there! Call for reinforcements 
and FIND them! I'm going to check the child." The Dark Legionnaires saluted, 
and Kragok started walking towards the same tent that the Jr. Chaotix were 
hiding in.
        "That guy's heading this way!" Nage gasped. "We gotta hide!"
        Pela-Ni looked up at the sound of his voice. "Oh, my . . ." she said 
softly, eyes wide. "Who are you?"
        All four turned around, grimacing. "Oh, gee," Nage murmured. "We didn't 
know . . ."
        "Ferget it, guys!" Jammer snapped. "She's gonna tell her boss we're in 
here! We're dead!"
        The medic shook her head frantically. "Shh . . . I won't tell, I promise!"
        "Please," said Rocky, desperately, "tell us where we can hide!"
        Pela looked around. "There, under the table!" She pointed. "Hurry, before 
Kragok sees you!"
        All four dove under the table to hide just as Kragok entered the tent.
        "How is the child?" he demanded.
        Pela blinked distractedly. "Oh, uhhh . . . She has . . . has yet to awaken, 
sir . . ."
        Kragok cursed, shaking a fist at Pela. "Find some way to WAKE her, then!" 
he shouted, turning away and heading towards the tent flap. He paused just 
before he exited and glared at Pela. "I will return in one hour . . . and 
she had better be awake by then, or heads will roll!" He turned on his heel 
and left.
        Pela waited until she was certain Kragok had left before calling, "You can 
come out now . . ."
        The four crawled out from beneath the table and stood up. "What child was 
he talking about?" Rocky wondered.
        Pela nodded towards Lara, who was still unconscious on the table. "The 
Guardian-child . . ."
        "Guardian-child?" they yelped in unison, crowding around the table.
        "It's Lara-Su," Rocky murmured.
        "Man, she don't look too good," Jammer said worriedly.
        Nage's eyes were wide. "What happened to her?!"
        "Yeah," Rex put in, "howcum she has bandages around her head?"
        The medic stroked Lara's bangs, gently, sighing. "Xenin injured her, and 
she hasn't woken up since they brought her to me," she said quietly.
        The Jr. Chaotix were silent, gazing at their motionless friend. Finally, 
Rocky spoke up.
        " . . . Is she gonna die?"
        The others shot him angry looks.
        "Rocky, don't say that!" Rex protested.
        "Yeah, Rock," Jammer growled, "what's up with that?!"
        Pela pressed a finger to her lips. "Shh . . . keep your voices down!"
        The Jr. Chaotix settled down. Nage looked up at the medic, a worried 
expression on his face. "She is gonna be all right . . . won't she?"
        Pela sighed. "I don't know . . . I'll do everything I can to help her, but 
Xenin injured her badly. It's all up to Lara."

        "Where exactly in the compound is she, Lina-T?" Knuckles asked, peering out 
of the forest at the Legion's encampment.
        Lina-T indicated a tent far to the right. "She's in the medic's tent, 
Guardian, recovering . . .
        Knuckles' jaw set grimly. "Then let's go . . ." He started into the camp, 
but Lina-T stopped him.
        "Shouldn't we come up with a plan to save her, Guardian?" she asked, 
softly.
        "There's no TIME!" Knuckles snapped, trying to keep going. This time, 
Mighty stopped him, grabbing his arm.
        "Lina's right, Knux. We need a plan."
        Knuckles relented. "Fine . . . got a plan, Lina-T?"
        Lina paused. "I think I may have an idea . . ." Everyone huddled around 
while Lina outlined her strategy.

        Kragok was pacing back and forth in his tent, impatiently. "Curse it! The 
child is crucial to my plans!" He snarled. "If she doesn't wake up soon, 
then all our plans will be for nothing . . . she is more powerful than even 
she knows, and she MUST be on our side if the Legion is to triumph! BLAST 
Xenin . . . he couldn't even handle the child without resorting to violence. 
Now she's-"
        He was interrupted by the sudden appearance of one of the Legion soldiers. 
Kragok looked annoyed. "Yes, what is it?"
        "Sir, it's the trespassers," the soldier said nervously. "We can't find any 
trace of them."
        "THEN LOOK HARDER!" Kragok paused, then shook his head, anger and 
impatience plain on his face. "Never mind, soldier . . . I'll look myself!"

        The Jr. Chaotix sat on the floor of the tent, watching the medic care for 
Lara-Su.
        "Y'know, guys," said Rocky, "I think we should get Lara-Su outta this 
place. She's not safe here."
        "But how?" Rex wanted to know.
        Pela-Ni hesitated, then stood up. "I'll help you," she said quietly.
        The Jr. Chaotix looked up at her in shock. "Y-you will?" Nage stammered. 
"Really?"
        Jammer gave Pela a skeptical look. "I dunno . . . can we really trust her?"
        "Jammer!" said Rocky, surprised.
        "She cared for Lara-Su and she helped us hide!" Rex put in.
        "So we hafta trust her," Nage concluded.
        "I promise that you can trust me," said Pela, solemnly. "Kragok has gone 
too far . . . I understand fighting against the real Guardian, but this one 
is only an innocent child! Such are you four, as well. I will help you all 
escape." She smiled kindly.
        Rocky shook his head in amazement. "Someone like you shouldn't be here . . .
you're way too nice to be working with a loser like Kragok! Why don't you 
escape here and start a new life on the Floating Island?" The others nodded 
in agreement.
        Pela-Ni chuckled softly. "I wish it were that simple . . ."
        "Lara-Su told us how her mom, Julie-Su, escaped the Legion and met her dad, 
Knuckles," said Rex, thoughtfully. "I'm sure it can work out for you just 
like it worked out for Aunt Julie!"
        The medic sighed. "Perhaps. But . . . for now, let's concentrate on getting 
you out of here." The Jr. Chaotix nodded reluctantly. "Now, listen to my 
plan . . ."
        A few minutes later, the medic and two rather tall, hooded Legionnaires 
exited the tent. The medic had Lara-Su in her arms.
        "Rex," Jammer complained from under the outfit, "yer too heavy! This ain't 
gonna work!"
        "It'd work if you'd hold me still," Rex shot back.
        "Hush!" Pela-Ni whispered. "Guards approaching, ten o'clock!"
        Jammer stopped wiggling and stood straight as two Legion soldiers 
approached them. "You three!" one barked. "Where are you taking the 
child-Guardian?"
        "Kragok's tent," Pela replied steadily. "On his orders."
        "I didn't hear anything about that, Pela-Ni," the soldier replied 
critically. "Are you certain?"
        "Quite certain," the medic replied. "Unless you wish to be the one to 
question Kragok's orders."
        The guard cleared his throat nervously. "Er . . . carry on!" He walked off 
hurriedly.
        Nage and Rex watched him go. "That was close," Nage whispered.
        "Too close," Pela-Ni replied. "We'd better hurry. Follow me!"
        They began to walk again, and soon arrived at the hovercraft hangar, where 
they were again stopped by a guard.
        "Where are you taking the girl, Pela-Ni?" the guard demanded.
        "She's to be transferred to the other side of the camp," Pela replied, "but 
I don't want to risk carrying her all the way. We need a hovercraft, 
Kragok's orders."
        "Really, Pela-Ni?" came a voice from behind them. "I don't remember any 
such orders being given . . ."
        The sound made Pela's blood run cold. She whirled around to find herself 
face to face with . . .
        "Kragok!" she gasped.
        "Uh-oh," Rex whispered.
        "We're in deep trouble . . ." Nage agreed, also whispering.
        Kragok stepped closer to Pela, eyes narrowing. "Where on Mobius did you 
think you were going with the child, Pela?" he demanded.
        "I . . . I was only . . ." Pela stammered, retreating back a few steps. She 
cradled Lara-Su's prone body against her, searching desperately for a way 
out.
        Jammer and Rocky, still carrying Rex and Nage on their shoulders, started 
to back up, trying to sneak away. "We gotta get help!" Nage whispered.
        Pela-Ni whirled suddenly, shoving Lara-Su into Rex's arms. "Run!" she 
shouted, pointing to a nearby hovercraft. The Junior Chaotix turned to run 
just as Kragok struck Pela a heavy blow on the back of her head with his 
cybernetic arm. She fell to the ground, motionless.
        The Jr. Chaotix abandoned their costumes, reaching the hovercraft. "Hurry, 
start it!" Rex shouted.
        "Get them!" Kragok roared. "They have the child!" Several Legionnaires 
lunged towards the hovercraft, shouting threats.
        "What about Pela-Ni?" Rocky cried.
        "We don't have time!" Nage replied, starting the hovercraft's engine. 
Jammer ducked beneath Nage, working the pedals as Nage steered. The first 
Legionnaires reached the hovercraft in time to get blown back by exhaust as 
it lifted into the air. Nage turned it, heading up and away from the camp. 
"We did it!" he cheered.
        "But . . . what about . . ." Rocky said, and they all looked down, sadly.
        "I wish we coulda saved her, too . . ." said Rex softly.
        Suddenly, a blast, fired from the ground, struck the side of the 
hovercraft. It began to plummet towards the ground.
        "We're hit!" cried Nage.
        "Brace yourselves!" Rocky ordered, holding Lara-Su beneath him.
        They heard Kragok shouting orders below as the craft got closer and closer 
to the ground. "Be prepared to capture them when they hit!" he shouted.
        The craft hit an empty tent with a resounding crash, skidding several feet 
before coming to a halt. A few moments passed before Nage dared to peer out. 
"Is everyone okay?" he whispered. Rex and Jammer got up, dusting themselves 
off, while Rocky held onto Lara-Su, checking on her.
        They looked up to find themselves completely surrounded by Legionnaires, 
all armed, all pointing their laser rifles directly at them. "Don't move!" 
one shouted.
        Jammer gulped, hard. "Looks like this is the end," he said weakly.
        Kragok pushed his way through the crowd of Legionnaires, growling. "Hand 
over the Guardian-child, you little BRATS!" he ordered.
        Rocky held Lara tight. "No!" he said, trembling. "You can't have her!"
        Kragok changed his approach. "Hand her over," he said softly, "and I won't 
hurt any of you. You can all go home, safe and sound."
        "Yeah, right!" Rex snapped. "Like we would trust you!"
        The Grandmaster was fast losing his patience. "Turn her over to me," he 
said slowly, "or die where you stand. Your choice."
        The Jr. Chaotix stood, silent, unmoving.
        Kragok watched them a moment, then sneered. "Have it your way." He turned 
to his Legionnaires. "Ready . . ."
        The children shut their eyes. "I wish our parents were here," Nage 
whispered.
        "Aiiiiiiim . . ."
        They whimpered, but held their ground.
        Kragok smiled, evilly. "Fi-"
        He stopped suddenly, as a red streak flashed by him, moving almost too fast 
to see. It struck the side of his head, and Kragok fell, crying out.
        The streak stopped, breathing hard, revealing itself to be none other than 
Knuckles. "I don't think so, tin-head!" he gritted, furious.
        The children opened their eyes. "It's the Guardian, dudes!" cried Jammer.
        Mighty smashed his way through the wall of Legionnaires. "Picking on 
children, Kragok?" he growled. "Have you really sunk that low?"
        Vector appeared, blasting Legionnaires with his walkman. "Yeah, dude . . . 
you oughtta chill for a sec, before we do something we'll regret!"
        Ray dived down, kicking and punching the Legionnaires as he went. "Banzai!"
        Espio materialized with the children, holding out his arms. "You guys 
okay?"
        Nage embraced his father tightly. "Yeah, we're fine, thanks to you, guys!"
        "You guys sit tight," Espio grinned. "We'll have you out and safe in two 
shakes." He whistled. "Lina-T!"
        Lina came and floated beside Espio.
        "Watch the young ones," Espio ordered. "I'm gonna go help the home team." 
He vanished, going to assist Julie-Su with some thrashing.
        Nage looked up at Lina-T. "Lina-T, can you ask our parents if they can save 
Pela-Ni?"
        "Who's Pela-Ni?" Lina asked.
        "She's a medic!" Rocky piped up. "She took care of Lara-Su and helped us 
out—a lot!"
        Knuckles had Kragok pinned in the mud, drawing back to punch him in the 
face. "I'll teach you to threaten my family," he growled, releasing the 
punch. He did it mechanically, left, right, left, right, over and over, mind 
clouded with rage.
        Jammer shrugged. "Yeah, I guess Pela's okay for a Legionnaire . . ." He 
yelped as Rex elbowed him.
        "Please, Lina-T," Rex said desperately. "She's not like them! Please, tell 
our parents to help her!"
        Lina-T sighed. "Well . . . I'll see what I can do . . ." She turned. "Lady 
Julie-Su!"
        Julie-Su walked over, brushing mud from her fur. "Yes, Lina-T?" The rest of 
the Chaotix came with her, including Knuckles. They had sent the 
Legionnaires packing, but Kragok had escaped Knuckles, as well, a fact he 
was none-too-happy about.
        "The children have requested that I ask you if you can help a Legionnaire 
named Pela-Ni," said Lina-T.
        Vector looked shocked. "Us? Help one o' THEM?"
        "But . . . well . . . she's okay!" Jammer said hesitantly. "She took care 
of Lara and she helped us try to escape."
        "You hafta help her!" Rocky cried. "She's not one of them!"
        Espio sighed. "I don't know . . . it's risky. Kragok could be back any 
second with reinforcements."
        The children looked at the ground, downhearted.
        "And I don't favor going another round with those guys. If they see us—" 
Mighty started.
        Ray broke in, sighing. "I just don't know."
        Rocky looked at Lara, who was still out cold. "I bet Lara-Su would want you 
guys to help her."
        Julie-Su raised her head. "I'll do it," she said softly.
        The children looked up, eyes alight with hope. "You . . . will . . .?" Nage 
asked, disbelieving.
        The rest of the Chaotix gave her looks of surprise. "But Julie," Knuckles 
began, "the kids—"
        "--wouldn't be here without this Pela-Ni person. I'm going to help." 
Julie's tone was firm.
        The Jr. Chaotix high-fived one another. "Thanks, Aunt Julie!" said Rex 
gratefully. "Yer the best!"
        Knuckles looked at his wife. "If you're going, then so am I."
        The Jr. Chaotix grinned. "All right!"
        "Count me in," said Espio.
        "Me too." Mighty folded his arms.
        "I'm coming," Ray volunteered.
        Vector sighed. "Fine. We'll break da girl outta here. This Croc's ready to 
kick tail!"
        Rocky looked back down at Lara. "What about Lara-Su?"
        Knuckles bent down, taking his daughter from Rocky and cradling her in his 
arms, tenderly. He gazed down at her, at the bandages around her head. A 
single tear traced down his cheek. He ripped off a piece of the fallen tent, 
wrapping Lara in it gently. "Lina-T?"
        "Yes?" Lina-T hovered close.
        "You and the kids," said Knuckles, "leave. Find somewhere safe and stay 
there."
        Lina-T nodded. "Of course." She turned to the Jr. Chaotix. "Come, children, 
we must go.
        Knuckles looked to them. "Go with Lina-T. We'll find Pela-Ni and get her 
out." He knelt, giving the unconscious Lara to Rocky. "Now go. Hurry."
        The Jr. Chaotix followed Lina-T into the forest. Knuckles watched them go, 
then turned to the others. "Let's go," he said, grimly, and without another 
word, they headed back into the Legion encampment.

        Pela-Ni bowed her head, eyes shut tightly. They had brought her to Kragok's 
tent soon after she had been knocked unconscious, and now she was a 
prisoner.  The chains around her ankles kept her from running, the ones 
around her wrist kept her from fighting. She'd never felt more helpless . . .
the guards beside her hadn't been very gentle with her, either, as her 
blackened eye attested, and the back of her head  still throbbed where 
Kragok had struck her.
        She shivered as Kragok glared down at her. "What did you think you were 
doing?" he demanded furiously. "You helped the trespassers escape! And not 
only that, you aided them in kidnapping the Guardian-child!"
        "They're children, Lord Kragok!" Pela protested, looking up at him 
pleadingly.
        Fuming, Kragok slapped the side of her face with such force that she fell 
to her knees. "They are the ENEMY, Pela-Ni," he growled softly, fists 
clenched. "And you are a traitor."
        Shaking from the blow, Pela was unable to make any reply. She gazed up at 
Kragok, searching his face for some sign of forgiveness, but he only sneered 
at her, coldly. She lowered her eyes again, thoroughly intimidated.
        Kragok sighed, drumming his fingers on his arm. "I'm afraid you will not 
live to regret this act of betrayal, Pela-Ni." He looked to the guards. 
"Take her to the prison tents. Come morning, she dies."
        Pela gasped, shocked. Execution was a fate reserved for those who committed 
only the most serious of crimes . . . She shuddered as she stole a last 
glance at Kragok's face as the guards dragged her from the tent. To her 
horror, he was smiling . . .

        Espio lurked at the entrance to Kragok's tent, camouflaged. It was still 
pouring rain, and he shivered, listening to the conversation inside.
        "Come morning," he heard Kragok say. "she dies."
        Espio grimaced. They had to get her out *fast* . . .
        He hung back as two guards walked out, carrying between them a young female 
echidna, bound hand and foot. She made no sound at all as the guards dragged 
her through the mud. That had to be Pela-Ni.
        Espio trailed them to the prison tents, taking careful note of which one 
she was placed in. He then headed back to the others, who were waiting at 
the edge of the camp.
        "I've found her," he said, coming out of camouflage mode, "in the prison 
rents. She's going to be executed if we don't get to her soon."
         Knuckles sighed, shaking his head. "Okay, gang, gather 'round. Here's what 
we'll do . . ."

        The two guards stood at the entrance to the prison-tent that Pela-Ni was 
being held in. They were both bored, and shifted restlessly from one foot to 
the other as they kept watch.
        "Guard duty is so boring," one yawned.
        "Yeah . . ." the other agreed. "Nothing ever happens—urk!" He slumped 
forward, gun falling from his hands.
        "Wha--?" the other one gaped, then fell as well. His finger tightened 
reflexively around the trigger as he dropped and a single laser shot fired 
out into the air. Espio materialized.
        "We gotta hurry," he said as the others came out from the shadows. "More 
will be along any second to see what that noise was about!"
        Knuckles nodded in silent agreement. He motioned, and they followed him 
into the prison tent.
        Inside the prison was a cage, and inside the cage, still bound hand and 
foot, was the shivering form of Pela-Ni. She looked up as they walked in, 
then gasped in fear.
        "Who are you?" she demanded, voice a trembling whisper. Then she saw 
Knuckles. "The G-guardian?!" She curled tight against the bars of the cage, 
as though trying to get as far away as she could. She was shaking, eyes shut 
tight.
        Mighty smashed the lock on the door effortlessly, opening the cage. 
Julie-Su walked in, kneeling beside her and examining her chains. "Don't 
worry, Pela-Ni," she said softly. "We're here to free you."
        "Me?" Pela looked disbelieving. "Why?
        "For helping our children, of course . . ." Mighty knelt beside Julie-Su 
and snapped the chains around Pela-Ni's wrists and ankles. He then picked 
her up and nodded to Knuckles. "Let's high-tail it outta here."
        "No arguments here, man . . ." Vector shuddered. "This place gives me the 
creeps! Let's book."
        The Chaotix walked out of the tent . . .and straight into the gun sights of 
close to fifty Legionnaires.
        "Not AGAIN!" Ray groaned.
        Kragok, standing at the head of his troops, smiled. "I had a feeling you'd 
be back, Guardian," he said softly.
        Knuckles backed up slightly. "Ray," he whispered, "can you fly over these 
goons if we keep them distracted?"
        "I think so," Ray replied.
        "Mighty, give Pela to Ray. On my signal, we fight, Ray flies!"
        Kragok growled. "Get ready to fire, troops . . ." He paused.
        He and Knuckles stared at one another, eyes narrowed. Neither blinked, 
neither seemed to even breathe for a long moment. Then . . .
        "Now, now!" Kragok roared. "Destroy them all!"
        The Legionnaires opened fire just as Ray, Pela-Ni in his arms, took off 
into the air. In all the confusion, no one saw him overhead, headed into the 
forest . . .

        "Like, how long is she gonna be sleeping?" Jammer demanded, sounding 
annoyed. He and the rest of the Jr. Chaotix sat in Lara-Su's bedroom, 
watching over her. Lina-T was outside, waiting for the others to arrive.
        "Jammer," Rocky said patiently, "she's been hurt bad. She needs a lot of 
rest!"
        Lina-T floated into the room. "How is she?"
        "Same as she always was . . ." Jammer pointed to her bed.
        "When do you think our parents will be here?" Rex wondered.
        Suddenly, Ray flew in through the open window. "How about now?" he quipped, 
letting Pela-Ni down from his arms.
        Rex ran to his father, giving him a tight hug. "Dad! You're okay!"
        The Jr. Chaotix then crowded around Pela-Ni, hugging her tight. "You're 
safe!" Rocky exclaimed.
        "We sure missed you," said Nage.
        Pela-Ni embraced them all, tears in her eyes. "I missed you, too," she said 
softly. "You were the ones who wanted to rescue me, weren't you?"
        They nodded. "You've helped us a lot!" said Rocky cheerfully. "It's the 
least we can do!"
        "Yeah," Nage agreed. "You're our friend! Friends help each other!"
        Pela-Ni was amazed. "Thank-you," she whispered. "I don't know what else to 
say . . ." The tears that had been threatening rolled down her cheeks.
        Lina-T floated over to Ray. "What of the others?" she asked, concerned. 
"Are they all right?"
        "Kragok's troops opened fire on them," Ray replied grimly, whispering so 
the children couldn't hear. "I don't know if they're even alive, but I'm 
going back to help."
        "I'll go with you," said Lina immediately. "Pela-Ni can stay here and take 
care of the children."
        "All right," Ray agreed, then turned to Pela-Ni. "Watch the kids, Pela . . ." 
he said. "Lina-t and I have something we have to do."

        Knuckles and the others were fighting as well as they could. Battered, but 
far from ready to give up, they watched as Kragok's troops nervously awaited 
their next order. Kragok's cybernetic arm had been injured, and he was in 
obvious pain. "KILL them, you dolts!" he shouted. "NOW! Attack!"
        The Legionnaires grappled with the Chaotix, the few that had ammo left 
continuing to fire.
        Knuckles was fighting his way through the crowd, trying to get to Kragok. 
Suddenly, Lina-T swooped out of the sky, diving straight at a group of 
Legionnaires who stood in Knuckles' way.
        "Lina-T!" Knuckles cried in surprise.
        Ray followed her down, striking at Legionnaires, knocking them this way and 
that. "Forget me?" he called to Knuckles.
        "We gotta haul, Knux!" Mighty shouted above the clamor. "There's too many 
of these guys—we can't fight forever!"
        "Leave that to me," said Lina-T softly.
        The crescent moon on Lina-T's forehead began to glow. It glowed brighter 
and brighter, until it was blinding. Kragok and the Legionnaires backed 
away, shielding their eyes. "Go! All of you!" Lina ordered. Knuckles and the 
Chaotix ran as fast as they could, into the forest, shielding their eyes 
from the glare.
        "No!" Kragok cried. "They're escaping!" He tried to pursue, but the light 
was so brilliant that he fell, unable to see. "NO!"
        Too late, for they were already gone.

        "Dad!" Nage ran to embrace his father as they emerged in front of the 
house. The other Junior Chaotix did the same, parents joyfully reuniting 
with their children . . . all but Knuckles and Julie-Su, who walked inside 
to see Lara.
        They entered her bedroom, quietly, unsure what they would find.
        Lara-Su lay in her bed, perfectly still but for the slight rise and fall of 
her chest. Her face was pale, her eyes closed lightly. Pela-Ni sat at her 
bedside, watching over her.
        The medic looked up as they walked in, expression saddened. "I'm so sorry," 
she whispered. "If Lara doesn't wake up soon, she won't at all."
        "Oh, Lara," Knuckles murmured, turning his head so that Julie wouldn't see 
his tears.
        Julie-Su leaned over Lara, stroking her bangs. "Please come back to me, 
sweetie . . . please. . ." She stroked her daughter's bangs, choking back 
sobs. She and Knuckles knelt by the bed as Pela-Ni left the room, knowing 
they needed privacy.
        "We love you, Lara . . ." Knuckles said, softly. "Please come back . . ."
        Julie-Su turned, guilt-ridden, and placed her head on Knuckles' shoulder. 
Knuckles put his arms around his wife, comfortingly. They stayed there for a 
long moment, grieving.
        Then . . .
        ". . . Daddy . . .?"
        Knuckles gasped. "Lara?" He turned to see his daughter, awake, gazing at 
them.
        She blinked, wearily. " . . . Daddy . . . Momma . . ." she managed, weakly. 
" . . . why are you so sad . . .?"
        Julie-Su covered her mouth in wonder, tears flowing. "We're not sad," she 
whispered. "Not anymore . . ." She and Knuckles enclosed their daughter in a 
gentle hug.
        Lara was still too weak from her injury to return the gesture, but she 
managed a small, brief smile. "What . . .happened . . .?"
        "You were hurt, love," Julie replied. "You've been sleeping for a long 
time."
        Lara turned her head slowly to look at Knuckles. "Are . . . those . . . bad 
. . . people . . . gone, daddy . . . ?"
        Knuckles nodded. "Yes, they're gone, sweetheart." He stroked her hair, 
gently. "You just relax. Everything's going to be okay, now . . ."
        Lara closed her eyes and almost instantly fell into a deep, but peaceful, 
sleep.
        Knuckles and Julie exchanged relieved glances. "She's okay," said Knuckles, 
softly, and smiled.

        Everyone looked up eagerly as Knuckles and Julie-Su entered the living 
room.
        "So," Rex voiced the question on all their minds, "how is she?"
        "Is Lara-Su gonna be all right?" Rocky asked.
        Julie smiled. "She'll be fine. She's a little weak, that's all."
        The Jr. Chaotix cheered, as Pela-Ni and the Chaotix smiled quietly, all 
thankful for the good news.
        "Well, that *is* good to hear," said a voice.
Knuckles whirled to see Lina-T floating behind him. She looked mostly unhurt 
from the scuffle, and the Guardian grinned. "Lina-T! Glad to see you're all 
right, old friend."
        "And I am glad to see that all of you are safe and sound," Lina responded.
        Pela-Ni stood. "I'd better be going, then.
        The Jr. Chaotix looked surprised. "But, Pela-Ni . . ." Nage protested, 
"can't you stay here with us?"
        Pela shook  her head, sighing. "You saved my life . . . I couldn't ask for 
any more favors."
        The children looked down, sadly. Rex hugged her. "Please don't go!"
        "C'mon," Jammer pleaded, "can't you stay a lil' while longer?"
        "I . . ." Pela-Ni blinked, "I don't know . . ." She looked to the Guardian, 
helplessly.
        Knuckles stepped forward, extending a hand. "You may stay, Pela-Ni," he 
said kindly, "as a friend who saved the most precious things in the world to 
us-our children."
        Pela took his hand, trembling with emotion. "T-thank you . . ." she 
whispered.
        The Jr. Chaotix cheered, running to Pela-Ni and hugging her.
        Pela laughed a little, hugging them back. "I don't know how to thank you 
all . . ." she closed her eyes, smiling. "I'm free . . . at long last, I'm 
free . . ."
