"Snively" by Knux Lee Echidna

Before the sun dawns I am awake,
In my green suit and coffee to take,
I patrol the city, yes alone,
With no-one save the headaches I'm prone.

I'm forced to type all the reports,
I do this and that of many sorts.
But do I get as much as a "Thanks"?
As rare as a meteor on the river banks.

And when I make just one mistake,
I know I'm dead, I know I'll bake,
Someone will strike, the one I detest,
To be sent to the infirmitry? Oh but yes...

And then there's stupid android,
How I'll love to shut him in the void,
To blast him with a bazooka,
To really crush him, To do ODTAA. (remember the novel ODTAA which stood for
one darned thing after another?)

Sometimes I feel so lonely,
Sometimes I feel so sad,
I wish I had a friend, a buddy,
Then life wouldn't be so bad.

No one understands my life,
No one even bothers,
My whole life is filled with strife,
My heart is heavy as ten boulders.

Someday I might feel happy,
I'll live in harmonious bliss,
I hope that day is near,
Until then you'll find me here,
In the city of Robotropolis.
