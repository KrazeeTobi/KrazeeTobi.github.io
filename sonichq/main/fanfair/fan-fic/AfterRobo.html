Ark-Ngel, an escaped experiment of Packbell to create winged warriors out of semi-roboticized Mobians, escapes to Knothole, inadvertantly bringing about its destruction with the exception of Sonic, mistakenly thought dead, and herself. Now, it's up to them to free the Freedom Fighters from prison, and start up Knothole village anew. Pretty original plotwise, but the word choice is awful. Also, some pretty big plot holes and fanfic cliches. Rated PG. By the way, if this Mobius Springheart is actually Robert Brown like rumored to be, Francis Tolbert is better without him.

<FONT COLOR="#996666">Added 3-99</FONT><BR>It's been almost 15 years since Robotnik was killed, and the new generation of Freedom Fighters are growing up. However, many villians still have to be fought before Mobius can be peaceful again, and the only with the Cyber Emeralds can the new Freedom Fighters win their fierce battles. Then one day, the Cyber Emeralds are drained of their energy, and the Freedom Fighters embark on a quest to restore their powers. These are really good stories, go ahead and read them.

You'll have to read that first to understand this story. "For Whom The Gavel Falls" is written from Snively's point of view, which, along with some impressive writing, makes this story worth reading. It's an awesome story, except for the parts with Bunnie. You'll see what I mean. Also, Snively's sarcasm gets a little annoying, but his views of and interactions with the Freedom Fighters are hilarious and more than make up for it. He insults <i>everyone</i> in Knothole, so if you really hate Snively or really like one of the other characters, don't say I didn't warn you. Awesome! Rated PG-13/R depending on how sensitive you are.<P><FONT FACE="arial"><B><I><a href="freedomfight.txt">Freedom Fighter's Fight</a></FONT></I></B> By <a href="mailto:anthony@aneace.win.net">Anthony</a><BR><FONT COLOR="#996666">Added 11-98</FONT><BR>The Freedom Fighters discover that Robotnik has returned and set off to kill him again! For author protection, I will retain my judgement. Some advice, though. If, in an English library, you still read out of the Juvenille section, please don't submit fanfic. This goes for everyone, even if you don't speak English. And if you don't speak English, I don't see how you ever got to reading this.

Upon learning his identity, the Freedom Fighters head towards Robotropolis on a dangerous mission. But this certain hedgehog is determined to take his path alone. Not a lot of action here, but still well worth reading. It leads the way for more following stories, so we have more to look forward to. Rated G.

Being a reasonable vixen, Sandra tells herself that they are not omens. But when the Freedom Fighters embark on a strange mission through the dephs of the Mobian Jungle to investigate a strange power source, Sandra discovers a new meaning to the saying, "once in a blue moon." An excellent story, but pretty slow-paced, so you might want to multi-task through this. The ending is well worth it though. It may be helpful to read Joseph DeLaCroix's "Starship Down" (which I unfortunately don't have on this page) first to understand this story better, but it's not nessecary. Rated PG.

A depressing story written from Tails' point of view that makes you think. How much is an individual life worth, and at what cost should one go to protect it? And how far should one go to protect a shattered illusion? Unlike "For Whom the Gavel Falls", this trial will not be clear-cut. This is a story with ethical and philosophical content; you have been warned. Rated G.

Snively organizes a jailbreak in the Devil's Gulag! A good piece, but a tad unrealistic in the fights, with everyone except the main
characters being total wusses. Also, I could have gone for a little more dialogue and descriptions, with less narration. Rated PG-13 for adult language.

The first installment of a new series by Duo, we meet the Freedom Fighters after the defeat of Robotnik, Naugus, and Snively. Sonic finds a sister, Tails finds romance (sort of), King Acorn is acting like a total jerk, and a surprise character pays an unexpected visit to the Knothole Freedom Fighters. Written in the style of the famous Knothole Chronicles; very nice. It's a bit predictable, but of course, we can expect more plot twists as more parts are added and more possibilities open up. Rated PG for adult language.
