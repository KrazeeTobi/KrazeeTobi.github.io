TIMELINE: After DOOMSDAY Project....Snively and Robotnik are dead 
(three years later)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------
        
        Night has fallen on the Northern Continent of Mobius where 
Knothole Village is located, the only village Robotnik never found.  
All the inhabitants of Knothole Village are getting ready to call 
it a day.  "Looks like we finally won the war, WAY PAST COOL!" 
Sonic cheered.  He couldn't help but to cheer after driving Robotnik 
and Snively off of Mobius.  Sally is thinking of her future as 
Queen of Mobius now that Robotnik and Snively have gone on to a 
more dreadful place (otherwise known as HELL!!!).  Sally has been 
planning on tying the knot with Sonic and rebuilding The House Of 
Acorn, her home as a child where King Acorn lived.  Peace has 
settled over Mobius.

        Somewhere else in the Northern Continent, Never Lake in 
particular, Amy Rose was just skipping stones over the water to 
kill time.  Something was troubling her.  Her home had been 
destroyed by SWATbots and she has had to live off the land ever 
since.  She was troubled by the fact of her homelessness returning 
to mind.  Suddenly, she got the slightest idea, she asks herself, 
"Why don't I ask if I can stay at Knothole Village?".  Since Sonic 
and Tails liked her (especially Tails. hint hint), and everyone 
else knew her, there was a 1:3 chance she could stay at Knothole.  
So Amy Rose went back to her tent, built of grass and wood (and 
maybe some glue).  The next morning brought on the challenge of 
packing her bags and making her journey to Knothole.

        Meanwhile, the morning of the Knothole residents wasn't such 
a challenge.  Instead, all the inhabitants of Knothole just got their 
teeth, face and hair washed and got dressed to live another regular 
day, a regular happy day.  Sonic had his usual fave for breakfast, 
"Chili Dogz!  Gotta love 'em".  Sally of course made a funny face 
of digust at what he was eating for breakfast.  Everyone else just 
had some good old fashioned toast and Mecha Sonic (Did I say he was 
dead?  NO!!  He is an FF in this alternate timelime) didn't eat at 
all.  He took the breakfast time trying to break Sonic's speed record.  
No success (HAHA!!).  Knuckles almost beat his speed record, missed 
it by 20 miles per second.  They all played volleyball after breakfast.  
Antoine tried to show off the whole time, "I'm da best!!".  Unfortunately 
for him, his efforts failed.  Sonic handed him his a** on a silver plate 
but of course, Bunnie whipped everyone into shape (you try blocking her 
spike).  They then proceeded to play a game of soccer.  Now this game 
Antoine excelled in.  Sonic was goalie for his team and Bunnie was 
goalie for her team.  Bunnie's team (including Antoine) scored 2 points 
and Sonic's only scored 1.  Antoine made the first goal from a nice 
pass by Rotor.  Sonic put the other in his own net.  Long story short, 
they were having a really sportive day as always.

        Amy Rose continued to make her long journey to Knothole.  
She drank only what water she needed.  She would reach Knothole 
within one hour from where she was.  She had been walking for a long, 
long, long 5 hours, waving to friends as she passed them by.  She knew 
that if she reached Knothole, she would finally have a home after a 
whole 6 years of living off the land.  She quickly walked through the 
buffer zone between the old Robotropolis to Knothole.  "I'm sure Tails 
will enjoy my stay," she thought to herself while beelining for her 
destination.  Then Amy Rose looked to the sky, a small white object 
with red stitches (said to be made 2000 years ago) was heading for 
Amy's head.  The white object hit Amy's head straight in the centre, 
knocking her cold......

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        
        "Ohhh, my head!  Where am I?  Knothole??".  Amy Rose looked 
around to see where she was.  She knew she was on top of a hospital 
bed.  Then Sonic appeared.  Despite her poor eyesite as an after effect 
of the knock-out, she was able to spot Sonic.  "Yo Amy, you okay?  
Whatz that nasty bump on your head??", Sonic said as he proceeded to 
fetch ice for Amy's head.  The second person Amy spotted was not who 
she expected.  Mecha Sonic was helping Sonic to nurse Amy back to 
health.  Amy asked in a poor, soft voice "What are you doing here you 
evil piece of scum?".  Mecha Sonic's eyes almost glowed red but his 
common sense fought back, fortunately for Amy.  Sonic then appologized 
"I'm sorry about this Amy.  I hit that baseball out of the Knothole 
field".  Sonic then put a baggie of ice on Amy's painfully suffering 
head.  Through all this confusion, Amy still focused on her hatred for 
Mecha Sonic.  Though Mecha is a FF now, Amy still can't forgive him for 
kidnapping her at Never Lake.

        Finally, Amy was able to see clearly and was able to get out of 
that hospital bed she was in.  Amy rehearsed her request to live at 
Knothole, "Sonic, could I please stay at Knothole?  I am homeless and 
need a place to go."  Amy finally took up all her courage, went up the 
stairs to Sonic's room and knocked at the door.  "Hello.  Oh Amy, glad 
you're alright," Sonic said.  Amy then asked the question of all time, 
"Sonic, I would like to know if I could live here at Knothole.  I have 
no other place to go."  Sonic looked surprised but glad all at the same 
time that Amy had asked to stay at Knothole.  "Amy, I would love to keep 
you at Knothole but we should ask Sally too since she is also leader of 
this village, and soon, Mobius."  So Sonic and Amy walked down the hall 
to Sally's room.  Sally was doing her hair (again, very vainly of her) 
as Sonic knocked at the door.  Instead of putting the pressure on Amy to 
ask the ultimate question, Sonic did the talking.  "Hey Sal, Amy would 
like to know if she could live in Knothole Village.  She says she has 
no where else to go."  Sally was as surprised as Sonic but of course, 
hearing Amy is homeless she automatically authorized her stay.  So Amy 
was staying but you gotta wonder, will Mecha Sonic go mad after hearing 
that Amy Rose is staying??

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Sally found the best guest room she could possibly find and 
annointed it as Amy Rose's room.  Amy thanked goodness that Sonic had 
also found her things.  Life was going wonderfully for Amy, now that 
she had a place to stay but still her thoughts focused on Mecha Sonic.  
Why was he here??  Amy then went into a session of deep thought and 
reflection, remembering that moment at Never Lake:

FLASHBACK: A World That Defies Time (Amy's View) 
<<This is different from SEGA's story>>

Amy: "Where are you going now Sonic?"
Sonic: "I'm heading straight for Never Lake.  Know about it??"
Amy: "Well kinda."
Sonic: "Well there's a special surprise happening on this particular night.  
Ever heard of the Little Planet??"
Amy: "Definately."
Sonic: "Well that's where I'm heading for.  It's coming over Never Lake 
tonight."

        <<Sonic speeded off for Never Lake with Amy Rose in pursuit.  
Upon their arrival, they were treated to a digusting, cruel surprise.  
The Little Planet was chained to the ground and was totally metallic.  
While Sonic was surveying the situation, a blur of bluish grey picked 
up Amy and carried her straight into the fortress of the Little Planet.  
She remembered being carried to Star Dust Speedway where she was imprisoned.  
Amy was just told to watch.  Whoever won the race would free her from the 
cage but the other would be blown to pieces.  Amy's stomach turned at the 
thought of Sonic losing and being scattered into little pieces.  This was 
Robotnik's doing, and Amy knew it.  Now all she could do was watch.....

        Sonic immediately ran up the chain holding the Little Planet 
hostage and into the metallic fortress of Robotnik.  After speeding 
through all the other continents on the Little Planet, Sonic located 
Amy at the Star Dust Speedway.  There he met Mecha Sonic.  "Hello 
hedgehog.  I am Mecha Sonic.  These are the race rules," Mecha Sonic 
proceeded to tell him the rules.  Sonic's stomach turned but he took 
the challenge, he had to.  "Alright Bozo, let's race," and the race 
started.  Sonic took the lead in the first turn where a speed trap was 
located.  Sonic jumped the trap and it hit Mecha Sonic straight in the 
chest plate.  Mecha Sonic's eyes glowed a bright red and he sped up, 
almost at the speed of sound.  Sonic dominated the middle of the race, 
avoiding speed trap after speed trap but at the end, it was a photo 
finish.  Sonic and Mecha Sonic were straight beside each other when 
suddenly, Sonic tapped the power of his chaos emeralds to become SUPER 
SONIC.  Super Sonic sped up to x3 the speed of sound, winning the race, 
and saving Amy's life from falling into the wrong hands.>>

Amy: "Oh thanks for saving me Sonic.  You're my hero!  Who was the 
metal guy?"
Sonic: "A duplicate of me made by Robotnik to fuel the entire scheme."
Amy: "That guy made me sick to my stomach."
Sonic: "Everything's okay now, now, now, now, now....." (echo)

        <<But not long after, Mecha Sonic was rebuilt...>>

        The flashback ended, and Amy almost screamed in fright but she 
knew it was only a memory.  She got up and looked at the clock in her 
room.  It was 6:30 pm.  She looked out the window to see what Sonic and 
Tails were doing.  They were playing dirt hockey.  Another glance at the 
window though gave her a fright.  Mecha's eyes were glowing red again.  
Sonic finished the game of dirt hockey he was playing and congratualated 
Tails on a game well played then went inside the forest to find his room.  
Amy still stared at Mecha Sonic though, his eyes still glowing a bright 
red.  "Something's wrong with this picture," Amy said as she went off to 
see how everyone else was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Mecha Sonic was out on the field still, eyes glowing red.  He 
checked his systems for any missions or anything else he could do.  The 
reason his eyes were glowing though, was this mission file:

**Assasinate: Amy Rose
  Object: Revenge
  Award for Mission: Sweet Revenge

        He was about to assasinate Amy, and he wasn't going to tell 
anyone anything about it.  He was just going to do his job, his mission....

        Amy started to get to know the Freedom Fighters better, 
especially Tails (hint hint again).  Amy and the gang all went out 
to the field to play a game of Capture The Flag (I'm not copying anyone).  
Mecha Sonic joined in on the opposite team of Sonic's (of course).  
Bunnie went for the big flag on the other side of the field but Sonic 
ended up capturing her cloth (which marked who's team she was on).  
Then Mecha went for Sonic's flag, but Sonic was just too fast for 
everybody and had captured his opponent's flag 15 times.  After the 
game, Amy went back to her room to get some rest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        
        Night fell on Knothole Village and not a sound was heard.  
Mecha Sonic turned on his sound dampers and tiptoed up the stairs, 
eyes bright red.  He located the door marked "Amy's Room" and opened 
it.  He found Amy, fast asleep.  In a metallic voice, Mecha said to 
himself, "This will be very easy."  Mecha got out his laser gun and 
set it to STUN, then shot Amy with it and escaped out the window with 
Amy Rose....

        The next morning, Tails woke up to see that Mecha wasn't there 
(He sleeps in the same room as Tails but not on the same bed).  He figured 
Mecha had probably woke up already so he went to wake up Sonic for 
breakfast.  "Sonic!  Wake up!  It's breakfast time, 7:00 am," Tails 
yelled.  Sonic woke up and went to Amy's room to wake her up.  Sonic 
opened the door, "Amy!  Amy!!!  Where is she???!!!".  Sonic found out 
she was gone.  Tails made a statement "Better question, where is Amy 
and Mecha??".

Sonic: "Are you meaning to tell me Mecha has kiddnapped Amy again??"
Tails: "It's the only reason they would both be gone."

        Sonic was furious!  He knew Mecha would do something like 
that but he wanted Amy to stay so much, he thought Mecha's common 
sense could fight back.  Sonic did know where Mecha would most likely 
take her though.  "He's probably keeping her at the old Robotropolis.  
I had better go there and bring him and Amy back to Knothole, Rotor 
will need to fix Mecha, again."  Sonic laced up his shoes, packed his 
power ring and com link and got ready for an important mission, to 
bring back Amy and Mecha Sonic.  The problem was that he would have 
to get close to Mecha to disable him for enough time to bring him back 
to Rotor.  By the time he had thought of that, everyone had already 
heard of the kidnapping of Amy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Knuckles looked out from his perch on the Floating Island.  
He looked over at the Great Swamp, then at the Great Forest, and then 
at the Old Robotropolis.  He saw Mecha Sonic there, he seemed to be 
holding Amy hostage.  Knuckles was confused, "I thought Mecha was a 
Freedom Fighter."  He knew something was wrong down at Old Robotropolis 
though so he went into a gliding position, heading straight for 
Robotropolis to see what was happening.

        Sonic meanwhile was taking the ground assault type approach to 
the problem.  He was juicin' over to Robotropolis to stop Mecha from 
harming Amy.  He would have to get pretty close to Mecha though.  If 
his eyes went red, he was dead meat.  He had to sneak up to him to 
disable him.

        Mecha laughed, "HA HA HA!!  Sweet revenge!".  He set his gun to 
OVERKILL.  Amy Rose pleaded for her life, "Mecha, please let me go, I'm 
your friend now."  No way in the world would Mecha let her go though, not 
without killing her first.  Knuckles arrived at the scene.  Knux glided 
above Mecha and stuck one of his spiked knuckles into Mecha's quills.  
Mecha was furious, "Knuckles!  You'll pay for that!!".  His eyes glowed 
brighter, and he shot his laser frantically at Knux.  Knux avoided laser 
after laser after laser, until one hit his arm, dismembering it from his 
body.  Just then, Sonic showed up.  Sonic saw Knuckles dismembered arm 
and Amy tied up, and he had to do something.  Sonic ran over to Mecha's 
chest plate and ripped it off as he passed by.  He then passed by again 
to unplug the power but Mecha backed away.  Sonic thought to himself, 
"I must get that power cord."  So then, Sonic got an idea, he tapped 
the power of the ring in his backpack and made another pass at Mecha.  
With the power of the ring though, Sonic was too fast for Mecha's 
optical systems to focus on.  Sonic successfully grabbed the power 
cord and unplugged it.

**TEN SECONDS UNTIL POWER DOWN** <<Mecha aimed his laser at Amy>>
**NINE**                         <<Sonic ran to free Amy before she became 
                                   mince meat>>
**EIGHT**                        <<Mecha shot a laser at Sonic's head 
                                   which apparently was in 
                                   front of Amy's ropes>>
**SEVEN**                        <<Amy's ropes got cut by Mecha's lasers 
                                   while he was trying to 
                                   hit Sonic's head>>
**SIX**                          <<Amy's pinky finger got skinned by a 
                                   laser>>
**FIVE**                         <<Sonic grabbed Amy and Knuckles and 
                                   put them in a safe spot>>
**FOUR**                         <<Sonic called Sally by COM-LINK to 
                                   come in the Bi-plane to 
                                   pick Amy, Knuckles and Mecha up.>>
**THREE**
**TWO**
**ONE**       **POWER DOWN**     <<Mecha's power went off and Sonic waited 
                                   for the Bi-plane to 
                                   pick up Amy, Knux and Mecha>>

        Sally finally arrived in the Bi-Plane.  She picked up Amy, Knux 
and Mecha and transported them by plane to Knothole.  Sonic ran to the 
doctor's office to call the doctor over to Knothole.  After the patients 
were checked out and hopitalized, Mecha Sonic was sent to Rotor's 
laboratory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        In Rotor's lab, Mecha was still being hooked to the computer for 
analysis of his systems.  Nothing got damaged but Rotor found something 
more surprising.  "So Mecha Sonic is reprogramming himself with memories
 from his memory banks, amazing!".  Rotor went to go tell the others:

Sally: "So Mecha is giving himself mission files by basing them on his 
memory banks."
Rotor: "Exactly."
Sonic: "He's using his memories?  I thought we erased them all!"
Rotor: "Memories do come back when erased from our minds in most cases."
Sonic: "Yes but this is a robot we are talking about here."
Sally: "Even if it is to our disadvantage, maybe this attribute could be 
        programmed into other robots in the future."
Sonic: "Yeah, that's right Sal.  Robotnik tried to make Mecha as much of a 
        mobian as he could."
Rotor: "That means that Amy is in danger because his memories will keep 
        coming back."
Sonic: "Unless we get it out of his mind or make the memory seem better 
        or something."
Sally: "Good idea Sonic but how will we pull it off?"
Sonic: "I dunno."
Rotor: "I have no idea either."
Sonic: "What if I appologize.  I did make his life miserable when he 
        kidnapped Amy at Never Lake.  It just might push that memory out 
        of his head, forgiveness solves things for the future, know what 
        I mean?"
Sally: "I think I know what you are getting at.  Mecha does have basic 
        emotions and an incredible AI!"
Sonic: "I probably won't be able to get a word into him though.  
        Mecha's too mad at the moment."
Sally: "I would of been able to but I have nothing to do with this 
        situation."
Sonic: "Then I'll try!"

        Rotor reactivated Mecha to sent him to his room (which was Tails' 
room).  Then, the Freedom Fighters executed their plan.  Rotor was ready 
to deactivate Mecha should he go haywire.  Sonic and Sally went up to 
Mecha's room and knocked at the door.  Tails answered the door, "Hello 
Sonic, please come back later, we're playing Monopoly, the legendary 
game from over 2000 years ago.  It's cool."  Sonic wouldn't leave 
that easy though, "Tails, It's important, I need to talk to Mecha."  
Tails sent Mecha to the door, "If it's that important, fine."  and 
Mecha popped his head out the door.  Sonic went on with the plan, "I 
need to talk to you Mecha."  The two hedgehogs went outside Knothole 
to talk things over:

Sonic: "Mecha, I'm sorry I've caused you only misery all those years, 
including that incident at 
        Never Lake.  Please don't take out your pain on Amy."
Mecha: "I won't take that c**p!"
Sonic: "We're working together now, all those years of fighting are over, 
we drove out Robotnik 
          together, as Freedom Fighters.  Taking revenge now is pointless."
Mecha: "Don't you go telling me what to do hedgehog."

<<Sally came outside to support Sonic>>

Sally: "He is right though Mecha, we fought Robotnik together.  All 
those years of Sonic giving misery are over.  We all have a bad memory 
once in awhile but we must go on with our lives.  Now Mecha, please 
take Sonic's appology and forget about all those years back."
Mecha: "Ok, appology accepted hedgehog."
Sonic: "Thank you, I'm sure you'll feel better for it."

        Mecha did feel better. To check, he scanned his emotion chip.

**Emotion Chip: Current Emotion: FORGIVENESS**

        Sonic felt better too.  All of their fighting incidents were 
forgotten, for the time being, and Amy Rose and Mecha      got along.  
Of course, Mecha, Tails and Amy played a game of Monopoly and Sonic 
joined in.  Rotor tryed to learn about that attribute of Mecha's but 
couldn't figure it out for his life, and Sally just rested.

                            THE END
