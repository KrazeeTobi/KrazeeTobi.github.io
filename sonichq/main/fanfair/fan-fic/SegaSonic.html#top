Now it's up to Amy Rose to rescue him, at all costs. A good concept, but horrid execution. Most of the story involves Amy making stupid puns and destroying robots, turning them into flowers. This story takes place in the SEGA Sonic universe. Rated PG-13 for adult language.

Finally, a story developing Amy! She has a lot of potential, but writers rarely use her, dismissing her as a one-dimensioned stereotype. I find the Chaotix's intolerance rather unrealistic though, and the wording is a little awkward. Rated PG.

<BR><FONT COLOR="#996666">Added 12-99</a></FONT><BR>Well. Um. I think you people are going to read this story because of the title no matter what sort of review I give it, so..Anyway, it's not exactly quality writing, but I find the dialogue funny. So sue me. I think it's SegaSonic, but I'm not even sure it's Alternative. For the full visual imagery of the story written on Microsoft Works (haha, I <i>love</i> the splat!), click <a href="deep.doc">here</a>. Rated R.

<FONT COLOR="#996666">Added 12-99</FONT><BR>During a badnik get-together in the SEGASonic universe, Robotnik's baddies decide that there's only one way they can take over all the zones; destroy all the ring monitors so that innocent Mobians won't be able to defend themselves! However, since only Mobians can destory ring monitors, the badniks scrape up all their money to hire the baddest of the bad... Nack the weasel! A light-hearted fic in the spirit of AoSTH (except not as lame), so if you're looking for Dan Drazen, this ain't it. But funny nonetheless. Rated G.

<BR>Vec: Something strange is happening on the Floating Island, and Knuckles must discover what happened to the echidnas in order to save the island.  I've read up to chapter 5 so far, and this fic is great.  An excellent way to start off the SegaSonic page.  This story is rated E.

<BR>Ryan Carroll (but you can call him Ryan) and his friend Jason end up in the SEGA Sonic universe after a science experiment gone right.  Not the most original plotline, but this is living proof that narrative <i>can</i> support a story. In this case, the narrative is absolutely positively sweet. If anything, read this for the narrative. Rated G.

<FONT FACE="arial"><B><I><a href="tornado.txt">You Say Tornado</a></FONT></I></B> By <a href="mailto:RGrimes131@aol.com">RGrimes131</a><br><FONT COLOR="#996666">Added 12-98</FONT><BR>In this story set in the SEGA universe, Sonic envies Tails' flying abilities and decides to try to fly himself by whipping up a tornado. But then something goes wrong, and it's up to Tails to save his hero! A good story in its own right, but not much plot. Oh well, you can't expect a Final Fantasy type storyline when you only have two main characters. It's pretty short, so if you're pressed for time, just read this quickly. Rated G.<P>
