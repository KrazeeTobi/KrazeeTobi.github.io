In honor of SatAm Sonic, I would like to present these two poems
written by Antoine and Sonic:
A pome, zat eez what I said. Ahem:
I am a Royal Gaurd, brave and true
Who would gladly be laying down my life for you

Hold onto your socks! Cause this is gonna blow you right out of your
shoes!:
When it comes to speed, I can't be beat
I'm faster than sound, I'm faster than heat
I'm so fast I burn up the street
Ain't that mondo sweet?

Yes Sonic and Ant it is true
we would love to hear more from you
but power pukes have cancelled you out
now we have something to complain about
We'll write and march and do what it takes
to take down those lowsy cartoon fakes
that decided to take your honored place
In TV land we should see your face!
Save Sonic's name! Save SatAM!
Loose the others! Bring out the cam!
We will be heard our voices sing
Our protests at Sega will definitely ring!
