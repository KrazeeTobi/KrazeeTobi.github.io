<br>This one is self explanetory by the file name. My 4 fave FF's of the Sonic Universe which include: Sonic, Tails, Sally and Bunny along with one of the best backgrounds that I've done to date! Anyway the background consist of jungle scenery along with the bridge (which Sally is sitting on) that spans the small river of knothole (made on 3/26/00)
