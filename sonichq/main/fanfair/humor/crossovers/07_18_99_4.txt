Star Trek Voyger / Sonic  -By Matt Hancock


A few years ago, I had an idea for a fanfic series which took the SatAM 
characters and stick them in Star Trek: Voyager.

The basic cast was never decided upon, but who I had in mind was:

Janeway: Sally
Chakotay: ???
Paris: Sonic (Much better @ Conn rather than first officier)
Kim: Tails
Torres: Rotor (Change the character name and gender around and it'll fit)
Neelix: ???
EMH: Himself (Can't change him)
Kes: Bunnie
Computer: Nicole
