Rock and Rule / Sonic    -- By RealLoneWolf


Okay people, this one may be a little obscure for the most of you people, but some 
time ago, I saw this great Nelvana movei called Rock and Rule, from the 80's, 
which I thought would make a great crossover.


Here's my cross-cast (I include the Sonic Underground crew, 'cause I think they'll 
fit in better):

(Note: It's been a while since last I saw the movie, so I'm not sure about all 
the names... Some I've forgotten alltogether)

Omar: Sonic
Dizzy: Manic
Stretch: Sonia
Angel: Sally
Mok: Ixis Naugus (hah! Bet you thought I was gonna say Robotnik, huh?)
The two bros who work as Mok's henchmen: Scratch and Grounder
Their sister: Breezy
The Weasel promoter: Nack
The Mean ol' Cop: Geoffery St-John
The Demon: Perfect Chaos
