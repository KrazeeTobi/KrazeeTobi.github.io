<b>Sonic Underground turns One; Possible concept of SU found?</b> - Sierra Ranay 14:45 pm 08-30-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Yep, Sonic Underground turned one today, with it being the anneversery of the day SU aired in the US, plus SU.net along for the ride.<P>On a side note, a fan manga of Sonic was just recently found on the net by Qtoken. Okay, Sega's said it before: SU is BEFORE Sonic met Tails. But who knew that before SatAM, before Archie, Before Sonic 3, BEFORE TAILS WAS EVER INTRODUCED IN 1992, there was SU? It was featured in a manga that was published in 1992, before Sonic 2. It features Sonic as a kid, along with a brother and a sister, both havin the resembence of Manic and Sonia, except in the comic, Manic is wearing glasses, and Sonia jas a FUNKY hairdo. Look for yerself. Could this be the pre-Su that existed before Tails' time? <P>  <A href="http://dream-avenue.simplenet.com/SonicHistory/Sonic_manga_big.JPG">Sonic Manga</A><P> WB had this to comment on the manga.<P><I>"The manga in reference is titled Shonen Jump - its the same manga that Dragonball Z and Dragonball and currently Akira Toriyama's new project Sand Land are serialized in.<P>  HOWEVER - I dont THINK its fully official. But then again - this is a case where we would NEVER know.<P>  You see - Shonen Jump is notorius for unnoficial stuff. However - you're absolutely correct. Theres NO WAY this could have been after Sonic SatAM. This is DEFINETELY before considering Shonen Jump doesnt do this anymore.<P>  What QToken found is whats called a "Fan manga". Its not official, but printed officially by a respected manga artist. Shonen Jump used to do this sort iof thing if I'm correct. The kids look NOTHING like Sonia and Manic, so I doubt theres any relation to SU at all, EXCEPT for the idea that it was out there before SatAM. It leaves wonder as to what other "goodies" are sitting out there in manga land.<P>  Sorry to dissapoint - nine times out of ten it probably isnt SU related, but it IS a gem nonetheless and newsworthy. And like I said - if this was in Shonen Jump and been on the net this long it was definetely before SatAM. </I><P>So while the mysteries of SU have yet to be solved, this could (or could not) be a key to where the idea may have been layed.<br>

<b>DC premiere.</b> - Bumper 17:12 pm 08-29-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Read the article.... Sega's really pushing the PR standard.<P>  <I>Who says that Hollywood is the only place for big-time premieres? Apparently, Sega didn't get that memo because it has planned a little something something for all its fans that have been shut out of the ECTS in London. Because the game-playing public is excluding from participation in the European Computer Trade Show, Sega has come to the rescue by offering a Hollywood-style premiere for its upcoming roster of titles. <P>  The big-screen Dreamcast premiere will be held at the Empire Cinema, Leicester Square London, and will feature a host of titles scheduled to hit stores by Christmas. The idea is to exploit the Dreamcast as the "world's only Internet-ready games console" as well as bring some attention to the holiday lineup. <P>  Reportedly, the event will hold approximately 800 gamers as they scurry to check out some of the first online DC games that they will be playing in the near future. Among the titles scheduled to appear, the UK's first public showing of Quake III Arena running on a Dreamcast. And if that wasn't enough to wet your panties, the main event will feature a 40-minute screening of breath-taking visuals and gameplay specifics to water your eyes. <P>  To further emphasize the fact that this event is not for the industry suits, Sega has commisioned the likes of Sonic, Ulala, and some of the Soul Calibur faves like Ivy and Mitsurugi to appear and pose for pictures. Now wouldn't that look nice on McDeez's desk? <P>  One thing is for sure, if you can't get into the ECTS and you want to see some of the best interactive games for the next few months, you better hop on the bus and get your hide to the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square. Tickets can be had only if you visit the Sega Dreamcast booth in front of the theater on Friday, September 3, the day of the showing, from 1:30 pm until 5:30 pm. You might as well hang around to get a good seat because the doors open at 6:00 pm for the show that starts only 45 minutes later. <P>  Do you want to be in the know? Do you want to see whay you'll be playing in a few short months? Tickets will go quick, and you already know what that's like. <P></I>  Credit: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/115.html">SegaWeb News</A> <br>

<b>Ecco the Dolphin contest!</b> - Bumper 17:05 pm 08-29-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Sounds like a damn good one too.....<P>  <I>Many contests that companies put on are lame and serve alterior motives anyway. However, let it be said that Sega is not one of those companies. It goes all out to make sure that its fans are getting the very best in gaming, and it throws in a stellar contest to boot. <P>  Sega wants to send you to Key Largo, Florida to swim with the dolphins. No, really. Sega has announced its "Swim With the Dolphins" radio contest that can out you in the water to meet one of Ecco's cousins, or maybe Ecco himself. The contest will be held in 10 cities via participating radio stations for whoever can make the best dolphin call/sound. <P>  If you live in one of the following cities and/or listen to one of the following radio stations, you may be a winner. The cities and radio affiliates are: <P>  WBCN Boston <BR> WKQX Chicago <BR> KEGL Dallas/Fort Worth <BR> WRIF Detroit <BR> KLOL Houston <BR> KROQ Los Angeles <BR> WKTU New York <BR> WYSP Philidelphia <BR> KITS San Francisco <BR> WWZZ Washington DC <P>  The way to win is to have the ability to sound the most like a dolphin out of all participants. After calling into the station, you will be asked for your best attempt at sounding like a dolphin while on the air. When your blowhole is tapped out, the station's listeners will then call in to vote on who was the best. Those who pass the on-air test will then compete in a playoff of sorts to determine the  regional winner. Beyond that, the nationals to determine who gets to swim with the dolphins. If you don't make it that far, it's not a total loss. Twenty-five winners per city will take home a copy of Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future for Dreamcast. An additional five winners per city will receive a Dreamcast console. And if you haven't guessed by now, the grand prize is a trip for two to Key Largo. <P>  So brush your teeth and gargle well to gear up for your best dolphin sound effects. Who knows, it could make you famous. Maybe you could star as the voice-over in the next Flipper series. </I><P>  Credit: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/118.html">SegaWeb News</A> <br>

<b>DreamMouse shots revealed.</b> - Bumper 16:59 pm 08-29-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Some DreamMouse goodness for y'all....<P>  <I>Sega of America has answered the prayers of many a gamer by announcing that it would release a Dreamcast-specific mouse peripheral to go with the keyboard that it has already shipped. One question that baffles us at SegaWeb is: Why did it take so long? <P>  Recently, Sega launched its mouse peripheral in Japan to admittedly mixed reviews. Many who have experienced the mouse have divulged a common complaint: the size. Many felt that the Japanese mouse was, well, mouse-sized. Too small for many, it is reportedly easier to maneuver with two fingers rather than the palm of your hand. Everyone knows that Americans like things big - big cars, big houses, big guns, and big women. Okay, so maybe that's just me... SoA has seemingly fixed this and has a new, revised mouse for its finicky American gamers. <P>  The new mouse is undeniably smooth and easy to control. Admittedly, it is akin to a standard PC mouse, but hey, that's what we are used to. What did you expect it to do, make coffee and iron yo'  clothes, foo? It is pretty basic and contains features that we have come to accept as standard including, but not limited to, the left and right buttons. The coolest feature that Sega was smart enough not to lose is the scroller dial. Undoubtedly one of the most innovative features that has ever graced a mousepad is present on your DC mouse. Also on the mouse is a button on the left side where your thumb rests that could serve a variety of purposes while browsing or gaming. <P>  All in all, it may be nothing to write home about, but it certainly puts a jolt in our shorts. After all, what fun is web surfing with your DC/keyboard combo without a mouse? Fret no longer, Dreamcast faithful. This will soon be in your sweaty little palms. Sicko. </I> <P>  <IMG SRC="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/imgs/mouse/01c.jpg"><P> <IMG SRC="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/imgs/mouse/02c.jpg"><P> <IMG SRC="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/imgs/mouse/03c.jpg"><P>  Credit: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/116.html">SegaWeb News</A> <br>

The inevitable complaints about the stupidity of shows like ECTS and E3 being closed to the public run rampant. Sega feels your pain, people, and they're doing something about it. <P>  This year at ECTS, Sega will be giving gamers the chance to sample its upcoming library of Dreamcast goodness. The playtest will be held at the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square, London, and from 6:00pm - 8:30pm on September 3, the doors will be opened to Sega fans everywhere. While no mention of specific titles has been made yet, you can bet some very cool stuff will be on display and playable. Hey! It's just like a gaming version of that room in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Only without Oompa Loompas. <P>  Sound good? We don't know what Sega has up its sleeve, but one has to wonder if this is purely an altruistic venture. Giving fans a sneak peek is certainly a way to generate some interest in upcoming titles, and good word-of-mouth advertising is always helpful. Or maybe the company just wants to say thanks to its loyal supporters. Maybe if you American Dreamcasters are good children for the rest of the year and make sure to wash behind your ears and clean up your rooms, Sega will do something similar at next year's E3. </I> <P>  Some interesting news for y'all....<P>  Credit: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/092.html">SegaWeb News</A><br>

<b>Dreameye info revealed!</b> - Bumper 19:41 pm 08-23-00

<div class=itemtext>
Some new info on a Dreamcast peripheral....<P>  <I>The new Dreamcast camera is on the way! I'm scared. Note toself: Catch up on beauty sleep ASAP. The Dreameye may sound like a cheesy 1950's horror flick ("It came from outer space to... err... look at things strangely! And... other stuff! Bad stuff!"), but any savvy gamer knows it just might be the coolest thing since Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon took over Marvel's "The Punisher" (okay, so that's cool to me anyway). It's the Dreamcast peripheral that will eventually allow obscene gestures to be shared among fragging multiplayers and your face to be scanned onto your favorite video game hero's head. And it's coming our way. <P>  Well, technically it's heading to Japan first, as with nearly all peripherals and most games. After numerous delays, Dreameye is scheduled to finally hit store shelves September 14. The complete Dreameye package is expected to contain the camera itself, a new version of the microphone peripheral, and other goodies like special software that allows real-time chat, sending pictures taken with the camera via e-mail, and other cool stuff. <P>  So when can Europe and the United States expect to see the Dreameye? We can't tell you. No dates have been hinted at, and the peripheral has yet to be officially announced for release anywhere outside of Japan. It's a safe bet to say we'll see it eventually, however, as its potential  uses could mean a new level of interactivity for console games, and we know Sega is all about pushing the envelope when it comes to the Dreamcast. Keep your eyes on SegaWeb for any and all new developments. </I> <P>  <IMG SRC="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/imgs/dreameye1.jpg">  <IMG SRC="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/imgs/dreameye2.jpg"><P>  Credit: <A HREF="http://segaweb.com/news/0800/095.html">SegaWeb News</A><br>

    Um,hi,im probably not recognized by many people,anyway,here is some interesting stuff:    I Live in Spain,province of Las Palmas,and yesterday,I saw a commercial on Television Autonomica de Canarias (channel 6 in this province)announcing a season of reruns of SatAM,that will start airing on the 28th of August,7:00 AM.I dont have a link source because I havent found out on this on a site,nor does the channel have a homepage.    Unfortunately,the channel is only available in this province,and its in Spanish(no problemo for me!).So any Spanish Sonic Fan that lives in this province,keep your eyes peeled for the series,and the commercials...    Oddly,the commercial didnt introduce the original SatAM theme,but dont worry,it sure aint Sonic Underground(thank god!). <br>

To help a greater range of people enjoy the wonders of Sega's 128-bit console, Ozisoft have slashed the price of the Dreamcast hardware dramatically to a highly affordable $299.<br> <br> Factoring in currency exchange, the Dreamcast is now cheaper in Australia than any other territory in the world, which is great news for those whose piggy banks haven't been quite fat enough to invest in Sega's powerhouse console. The new price of $299 includes GST.<br> <br> Sales Director for OziSoft, Danny Gambaro, said, "At $299, Dreamcast is a true mass market consumer product. Our offering at $299 is giving consumers the most sophisticated games console and access to one of the fastest growing entertainment and information resources the world - the Internet."<br> <br> Stephen O'Leary, Dreamcast's communications manager, said "Dreamcast is the first console to be released with a modem as standard, providing millions of Australians with the ability to access the Internet and Email at a fraction of the price of a home computer. Together with its incredible library of existing and upcoming software titles from SEGA and its many 3rd party developers, the Dreamcast has firmly established itself as the next-generation entertainment and Internet (TV) set top box."<br> <br> The announcement is official as of today, but the price drop will not be effective till Thursday 24th of August.</em></p>  <p>So, finally the good ol' Ozisoft get their tuckus in gear (since the Australian DC has been porr since the launch) but riddle me this, if this is to happen to us Australians, what about the rest of the world? Could this mean Captain Pricedrop is ready to bombard the US and UK in hope to out wit the black doorstop with only 2 controller ports? We Shall see :P</p> <br>

<b>The Truth on Sonic Team</b> - Joey 19:27 pm 08-10-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<P>Ok, it seems there is a bit of confusion here. Despite the fact that Sonic Team is "seperating" from Sega, they are still PART of Sega. Here it comes straight from the <B>Official Dreamcast Magazine.</B>  <P><I>In a move to make its first-party titles even stronger, Sega of Japan's internal Research and Development teams has been redefined as financially independant, seperate "companies" within Sega, and given a carte blanche to name themselves whatever they want.</I>  <P>As you can see, just because they are "seperated" from Sega, they are still loyal to their parent company. Also- it was not Mr. Naka, not Sonic Team, but Sega <B>itself</B> that decided to let the R&D teams become more independant. Yes, there is a small chance these 'companies' might develop for other companies, but that is <I>very</I> slim, especially for <B>Sonic Team</B>. Sonic Team's home, it's parent, is Sega. If they were to stop developing for Sega, yes, that might bring bad news. But they're <B>not</B> stopping.  <P>Really, just don't jump to conclusions! These R&D teams are technically still part of Sega itself- there is almost no way they would take major risks in working for other companies. And as for Sonic Team, who SAID that they would stop making Dreamcast Sonic games? It's still the same old Sega, folks, read: They are not leaving Sega!<br>

<div class=itemtext>
   It seems that Yuji Naka and his Sonic Team decided to branch off from Sega and become an independant company. This means that they will be producing software for other systems and platforms other than the Dreamcast. This also means that we may no longer see any more Sonic games after Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Shuffle. A NiGHTS game, like many have been waiting for, may also not be produced for this reason. This also means that the Sonic Team runs the risk of going bankrupt soon, since no company now holds their funding. In a short Editorial, I think Yuji Naka made a small mistake that could lead to big problems. I think he should have never left Sega.<br>

EMULinks will be a large non-profit directory of emulation and gaming-related sites.  It will be dynamically-generated, allowing far greater complexity than you could find on a hand-made directory page.  <p>Andy Wolan, owner of emulationzone.org, who hosts sonichq.org and gave us the domain name, has written this press release:  <p>As part of our on going commitment to the emulation scene and to video gamers alike, the Emulation Zone is proud to announce <a href=http://www.emulinks.com target=_blank>EmuLinks.Com</a> . The goal of this new web site is to pick-up where many search engines, like Yahoo, leave off by offering a complete database of links geared toward emulation and video gaming. Since it's coded, owned and operated by us, a non-profit organization, you can be sure that we will strive to offer our viewers an unbiased  service they can depend on.  <p>What makes our site unique from many "link sites" on the web is that our site is completely automated. This allows us to do things to our database of links unimaginable or too difficult to incorporate on site that are edited by hand, such as real time user feedback.  <p>The site is currently in its final beta testing phases, but just about all the bugs have been ironed out. I would like to cordially invite everyone with a related web site to on stop on by and <a href=" http://www.emulinks.com/v1.0/submit_create.php3" target=_blank>submit</a> a link to your site. Our team of reviewers will go through the link submission and review the sites accordingly.   <p>If you don't have a web site, we would like to welcome the public to play around with the site, add links to their favorite related home pages and give feedback on what they think of the place.<br>

The show was part of a reshowing of the most popular cartoon shows voted  for. This probably means Sonic Underground including the rumored "Lost  episodes" will never be seen again as after Agro's Cartoon connection was  cancelled, there was a 3 year gap before a show like it came out.

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>.

HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
