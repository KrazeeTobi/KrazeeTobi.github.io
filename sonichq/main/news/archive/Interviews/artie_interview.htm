</font><p>Greetings! Member of one of the "Big Four" of Sonic websites, SHQ would like you to meet Mike Reyes! Better known amongnst Sonic fans as Artie! Owner of Team Artail - we sit down with him and have a little chat and everything and anything.</p>

</font>Lets get started - shall we? :O)</p>
<font face="arial", "helvetica" font size="2">

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> First can you give us some background on yourself? Like who you are
and just what it is you do for those that don't know.

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I'm 19, I work as a projectionist at a movie theater, I'm a
really big anime fan, and... I think that's about it!  And of course I'm
a Sonic fan too :)
   
<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> How did you become a Sonic fan?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, my first exposure to SOnic was in stores when Sonic 1 for
Genesis was on display.  I remember just wanting to go to the store so I
could play the demo there :)  I was really happy one year when I got a
Genesis & Sonic 1 for Christmas, but I didn't really get INTO Sonic
until I saw AoStH on TV on day after school.  I began taping it every
day and I've still got most of the episodes on tape, but I hardly ever
watch them ^_^;  I also got SatAM as it aired on ABC way back then.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> In becoming a fan of Sonic, has there been a particular video game
in the series that has influenced you in any way and why?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, Sonic 1 (Genesis) was what started it all for me, but I'd have
to say my favorite game in the series was Sonic CD (Sega CD).  I liked
the idea of every act in every zone having a past, present, and 2
possible futures.  That just made the game so much bigger!  And I LOVE
the Japanese soundtrack to the game!  The U.S. music was good too
though.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Everyone knows of your prevalence to SatAM more than anything else.
Why is that? What puts it above the others in your opinion? What about
the games?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, the reason I like SatAM so much is because of the level of
character development it went into.  It wasn't just another slapstick
cartoon for cheap laughs.  There was a STORY here, and I'd have to say
that SatAM is my favorite American made cartoon EVER! :)  And I
personally like the way it compares so well to anime ;)  1) The level of
character development it went into, 2) the total of 26 episodes (Quite a
few anime series have only 26 episodes) and the kicker: 3) It has aired
edited on U.S. TV! (The USA Network)  I don't feel the other Sonic
cartoons ever reached the level of the storyline in SatAM.  I did watch
4 or 5 episodes of Sonic Underground, but I just couldn't bear to watch
any more after that!  I'm not really into the story of the games either,
I neither like or dislike it.  And I won't even start on Archie!

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Give us some history of Team Artail? Why was it started? What keeps
you on the page doing it - basically, What keeps you driving in doing
your webpage daily - in your eyes what makes it special?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, The site was originally started over 3 years ago with only a
handful of pictures by furry artist Matt Burt (Who is still on the site,
but his page hasn't been updated in a LONG time).  From there I don't
even remember how it's evolved.. but you can see what it is now!  I stay
with the site because sometimes I just like the feeling of getting a big
update done, and it'll be a great pleasure to see if I can get my daily
counter to reach 1,000 again :)  And I do daily updates off and on.
Sometimes I'll do daily updates for a while, but then I either get too
busy with other things, or lack motivation to continue doing it daily
^_^;  When I first put my site together I tried to make it what I
personally would have liked to see in a Sonic site (There's so much more
I'd like to do with it now that I lack the time for though).  If you'd
like to see the history of the site through 1997 & 1998, I still have
complete update logs at: <a href=http://www.teamartail.com/1997.html>http://www.teamartail.com/1997.html</a> and
<a href=http://www.teamartail.com/1998.html>http://www.teamartail.com/1998.html.</a>  But note that a lot of information
on those pages may be out of date now!  Some of the stuff that was added
to the site then is no longer there for certain reasons.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Your page was originally all Sonic. What prompted you to add
Pokemon to the site? Have you ever gotten flak from visitors about it?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I was big into Pokemon when I Made that decision, but as you
can see now, I've been really neglecting the Pokemon area of my site
^_^;  The only thing I really like of Pokemon now is the anime, and even
that I haven't been following lately.  As for visitors' opinions of
Pokemon being added to the site, some liked the idea, others didn't.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Your page is respected as being one of the best Sonic fan-specific
pages on the net. In your own words - what do you think keeps people
visiting it?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I can tell yuo that daily updates help a lot :)  But other
than that, I think the most popular thing on my site, currently, is the
massive fan art archive.  The Freedom Fighter Profiles section is also
very popular, but I can't take any more character submissions right now
because it's more of a chore to update than anything else on the site!
I also couldn't take the people who were getting mad at me for not
posting their characters right away, and I just decided I didn't want to
deal with it anymore.  I decided to leave the current characters up
though, because a lot of people want their characters to stay there.
Many of them are very out of date though.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What prompted you to stop placing profiles of fan created
characters on Team Artail?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Oops, I just answered that question above ^_^;

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Recently your site has been known as the one which hosts the Sonic
SatAM petition. Congratulations on recieving 1000 signatures by the way
Artie. ^___^ What prompted you to take on the reigns of this petition?
Do you think that it will succeed where others have failed - and if so
why?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I first took on the petition because I thought a more popular
SOnic site could gather more signatures than some other smaller sites.
I wasn't doing it to try to beat out those other petitions, I just
wanted SatAM back as much as they did. The first petition died though
(The script for it), and I decided I'd just leave it at that and let the
other petition on SoNiN's site gather signatures.  But a while after
that, he notified me that he was going to move his site and his petition
was going to be lost. So I started up another petition, and I must say
I;'m pleased with the amount of signatures it's recieved thus far :)
There's one thing I'd like to say though, if you've already signed it,
don't sign it again!  2, 3, or 10 signatures from the same person don't
help a thing in a petition.  I do know that another Sonic cartoon is
supposedly in the works, but I'll comment on that more when I know more
about it.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> How do you think Sega should handle the development of its
characters in non-videogame media?  Do they have an obligation to keep
Sonic and the other characters as close to their game personalities as
possible, or do they need to allow the comic/TV/whatever writers freedom
to develop the characters as they see fit?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, personally, I don't see much room for development
characterwise in a lot of the older Sonic games.  I think Sega did an
excellent job in creating personalities for the characters when SatAM
was aired.  I know there are a lot of fans now though, who prefer the
Sega storylines of Sonic CD, Sonic Adventure, etc.  I'm just not as much
into those, but to each his own...  I say let Ben Hurst loose at DiC
with the 3rd season script for SatAM!! :D

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What is your honest opinion on the Archie comics? Vile desecration
to Sonic or helpful image that keeps him alive?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Forgive me for saying so, but: Vile desecration to Sonic!  In the
story sense, I think they've ruined Sonic, but the comic does serve to
keep the title of Sonic alive.  I haven't read any of the issues after
around 60 something or so.  I just lost interest when I saw the
direction they were heading with the series.  They've gone from SatAM
continuation to video game storylines, and I'm just not into that.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Why do you think some Sonic fans show so much animocity towards
leaving the Sonic SatAM continuity - do you believe moving more towards
Sonic Adventure was the right thing? Why?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, as my personal opinions continue, I prefer pure SatAM to be
the true Sonic universe.  I believe what they're doing with the comic is
a way to please many fans, but just not me.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What has been your best, saddest, and most frustrating moment ever
in the production of Team Artail? Describe some of your most memorable
moments good and bad.

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Hmm.. well, The best moment that stands out in my mind was when I
did an update that posted 325 new pics of fan art at one time! :)  I'd
have to say the saddest moment for me was when I was afraid I'd lose my
site when I had to make the move from www.artail.com (hosted on
mightyfox.com) back to artail.simplenet.com.  I had to redo the site
simply with what I had saved on my HD, because the server it was hosted
on went down without any warning and I couldn't reach any of the files
on it, or the admin.  It's frustrating to me sometimes when people send
me emails flaming me for one thing or another, saying I think I'm the
best and I want to block out other Sonic sites and whatnot.  Now it's my
own opinion that I'm NOT the best.  I think Sonic HQ and The Sonic
Foundation keep way more up to date with happenings in the Sonic
community than I do.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> The comics that you host - based on the works of Dan Drazen? What
prompted these?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I had long since been a fan of Drazen's Sonic fanfics.  I
toyed with the idea of getting some of the artists on my site to produce
comic adaptations of the stories, and I got Drazen's permission to go
ahead with it.  So I asked around the artists on my site and found a
couple who were willing :)

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Your site hosts work of the likes of Rina Cat and Bara Chan, who
designed your logo. What Sonic fan artist stands out in your mind most?
And what makes those artists work so special?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> There is no way I could pick out one, or even a handful of personal
favorite artists.  All I can say is take a look at the Sonic/Furry fan
art archive on my site.  THOSE are my favorite artists! :)

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Do you remember Yerf? Back in the old days of Sonic fandom, before
Yerf.com placed a pagewide ban on Sonic artwork of all forms it was one
of THE PLACES to place your art. In your opinion, was it wise of them to
shut it down just because they had gotten too much of an influx of
Sonic? Do you believe that originality in fan characters - or lack
thereof in some cases - is what prompted this shutdown?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> I think it was the opinion of most furry fans that Sonic shouldn't
really fall into the category.  And I totally believe in originality in
fan characters.  I really hate seeing people rip off other people's
characters, but I won't get involved in a fight between them about it.
As for Yerf, I think it was entirely okay to do what they did.  They
were providing a free service for hosting art, and although I really
don't care for the management there, I've gotta say their file
management scripts rock :)

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What things OUTSIDE of Sonic net fandom do you like to do? Some
know you have a fascination for Anime - specifically what kinds and why?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Ah yes, Anime, my newest obsession ^_^  Well, my favorite series are
Tenchi Muyo, Battle Athletes, Lain, Evangelion, Pretty Sammy, and Gundam
Wing, just to name a few.  And my favorite anime character of all time
is Sasami/Pretty Sammy!  Heh, well anyway, I have a huge collection of
anime DVDs which you can view here
(http://www.dvdtracker.com/~artail.asp).  And aside from Anime, I don't
really have any other interests outside of Sonic.. I'm just some
anti-social loser who sits on the computer all day :)

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Do you believe that Sonic fandom now is tighter than it has been or
spread apart further? What do you think has caused this? Do you believe
that the big Sonic webpages like the Sonic HQ, The Sonic Foundation, Neo
Green Hill Zone, and TeamArtail, and the numerous mailing lists and
newsgroups help to keep Sonic alive in the fandom or hurt it?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> I think Sonic fandom is spread out more now than it ever has been.
With all the options you have now with the games, SatAM, Archie, Sonic
Underground, there's fans of each.  Web Sites and mailing lists do help
to keep the fandom alive by providing a medium of communication and news
for the fans.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> In addition to that - do you think our voices as a fandom even
matters to Sega and DiC?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> I think the thing that matters most to the companies involved is our
wallets.  When you think about it, everyone is out to make money in the
business.  But sometimes the best way to go about doing this is to
actually listen to the fans and seewhat they want.  It's one thing to
SAY you'll go and buy something, but it's another thing to actually go
and DO it.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What are your current favorite videogames and why?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I haven't really been in the video game loop lately ^_^;  Too
much anime on the brain!  But I really like the Final Fantasy series and
I'm REALLY looking forward to the movie next year.  My favorite genre is
RPGs.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Do you think that Sega and DiC truly care about the Sonic character
anymore?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> I think there are those within the company who do care about the
characters (Ben Hurst for one), but I think the prevailant way of
thinking for the higher up people is to try to do whatever makes the
most money for them.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Robotnik's old look (SatAM) VS Robotnik's new look (Eggman - Sonic
Adventure)? Honestly - what do you think is better? ^_^

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Robotnik's SatAM look ruled!  He completely fit the part of an evil
dictator!  I think Eggman is more of a comical look, as it doesn't
really send as much the point of evil across to me as SatAM Robotnik
did.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What has been your most memorable (good and bad) experience with
Sonic fandom both in real life and on the internet?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> In real life.. hmm.. I'd have to say watching SatAM on Saturday
mornings as a kid.  On the internet... I really don't know what I'd put
for this, so I think I'll just avoid the question ^_^;

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Are Videogames truly a form of art? What do you have to say to
people that think it is or isn't?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Hmm.. I really can't say I have an opinion on the matter...  but if
I were forced to choose, I'd say that video games are a form of art, for
the people who create them in Japan.  I'm sure for most games that a lot
of work goes into creating the characters and story for the game.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> Who are your influences in life?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Hmm.. I don't think I have any O.o

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What makes doing your webpage fun?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> The satisfaction of getting a large update done, getting fan mail,
or watching that counter go up! ^_^

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> What are your future plans for your career? What do you aspire to
do?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, I've been toying with the idea of making an Anime division for
Team Artail, but I haven't made any official decision on that yet.

<p><b><font color=blue>SHQ:</font></b> And finally - What kind of challenge would you like to pursue now?
And what is your greatest achievement with Team Artail?

<p><b><font color=red>TA:</font></b> Well, as I said, I'm thinking about doing an Anime site :)  I think
my greatest achievement on Team Artail is the Furry/Sonic fan art
archive, completely maintained by hand and with over 5,000 pics!
