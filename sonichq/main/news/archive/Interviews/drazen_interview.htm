</font><p><b>Sonic HQ</b>'s exclusive interview with one of the most well known, well respected Sonic fans as well as monthly reviewer of the Sonic comics, Daniel Drazen is here! The following message was sent to him to precede the interview. This interview is by WB. Now, read on!</p>

</font><p>Greetings Sonic fans! Faster than a speeding storyline, more powerful (and less confusing) than an MLA Handbook, able to leap small paragraphs and badly written dialogue in a single bound! Superfan! Born on Planet Earth, Daniel J. Drazen - a mild-mannered librarian from a friendly metropolitan college - fights for truth, justice, and the Sonic fan way!  Respected by all the fandom, the eldest of the group and an all-around cool, well spoken dude to boot Dan Drazen cranks out fanfiction, and reviews of the books we read every month in a timely fashion. </p>

</font>So without further ado, lets start this interview the same way he starts his webpage. Once upon a toon.... :O)</p>

<hr width=100%>
<font color=000055 face=arial size=2><b>Special Note & Apology: </b>Before I get started I feel I have to apologize first hand and explain some things. Back in April we celebrated our anniversary. During that time the plan was to interview James Fry, Artie (Team Artail) and Dan Drazen. Unfortunately, the first go round we didnt get the interview in time so it had to inevitably be pushed up. Shortly after I did get the interview though, my harddrive crashed and I lost the original one as well as several pages of SHQ, artwork, and schoolwork. The fact that it was nearing finals time didnt help either. :P Mr. Drazen did send me another copy ages ago but its been sitting on my harddrive forever collecting the eqiuvalent of electron dust. Call it procrastination, call it forgetfulness, call it your typical Jon Gray screw-up at work. Considering college (now art college), real life stuff, time off, and everything else that had been going on with me I just kinda forgot or set the interview back back back everytime I told myself or promised that I'd put it up. So I think that I need to take this time before the interview to publically and formally apologize to Mr. Drazen and the Sonic fans who visit our page and have been waiting since the dawn of time for taking so absurdly long in doing this. Sorry Mr. Drazen for the delay, and I hope you accept my apology. :) **Gives him an internet cookie and a "get out of cliff kicking free" card in return**

<p>And for everybody else - **gives you a big wet raspberry and tell you to read!**
<hr width=100%>

</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>First can you give us some background on yourself? Like who you are and
just what it is you do for those that don't know.

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Well, I'm one of the senior members on the list. (Referring to the <a href=mailto:rdbauerle@juno.com >Archie Sonic Mailing list</a> -<i>WB</i>) I was born December 29, 1951. 
I have a twin
brother, Patrick, and a younger brother, Timm, who died of smoking-related
cancer last year.
My parents also died early, in their 50's.  I grew up in Berwyn, Illinois, a
city just west of duh
great city uh Chicaguh (as the legendary Mayor Daley used to say).  I attended
Andrews
University in Michigan and got my B.A. in theology; it was there that I also met
and fell in love
with my wife, Nancy.  We've been married 23 years last February.  I also have a
Master's degree
in Library Science from what is now Dominican University in River Forest,
Illinois, but back
then it was Rosary College.

</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>We had heard that you were a teacher/professor in college? What is it
that you teach and what drew you to your profession?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I'm on the Andrews University faculty, but not on the teaching faculty. 
Librarians have faculty
rank here.  I'm the editor of the Seventh-day Adventist Periodical Index. 
Basically, that means I
get to read magazines for a living.  Is that cool or what!?  There are about 45
titles published by
the church that I read and index, then I enter the information about the
articles into a database.
The work suits me, though most other people would find it about as interesting
as watching paint
dry.

</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How did you become a Sonic fan?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I started taping some of the SatAM TV shows back in September 1993 so I could
keep up with
the conversation on the rec.arts.animation newsgroup.  Before I saw it I was
inclined to dismiss
"Sonic" as just another half-hour commercial for Sega until I actually saw some
of the eps.  I
loved everything about it at once: the writing, the art, the characterizations,
the voice work.  I
was hooked.  I'm pretty hopeless when it comes to the games themselves.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>In becoming a fan of Sonic, has there been a particular video game,
comic book issue, or cartoon episode that has become your favorite? And if
so why?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Like I said, it wasn't because of the games.  WRT StH, there were a couple of
first season eps
that really tipped it in for me: "Sonic and Sally," where Tails realizes that
they're dealing with a
robotic Sally, and "Sonic's Nightmare," where Sonic gets to do more than spout
hip-cool jargon.
As for the comic, I didn't know there WAS a Sonic comic until I saw the cover
for #18 and its
picture of Sonic and Sally about to get married (!).  That was the hook, but
what kept me was the
quality of the writing for "In The Still of The Night" by Kanterovich and
Penders.  The death of
Julayla in that story was handled extraordinarily well, with intelligence and
sensitivity.
Unfortunately, the writing in the book has seldom, if ever, scaled those heights
again.  But I keep
hoping.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Can you give us some feedback on how you had, at one time, been "the
official reviewer" for the Archie comics? How did you get that monicker and
what happened?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>At first I simply wanted to put together a Sonic FAQ file, the remnants of which
are on display
as part of my Sonic Web site.  Somehow or other, I started doing full-blown
reviews, and I've
been doing them ever since.  I've actually gotten e-mail from people telling me
that the reviews
are more entertaining than some of the comics!  Which says more about the
comics, I think, than
about my skills as a writer.

<p>WHO got the idea that I could do reviews for the Archie Web site, I'll never
know.  But one day
Fred Gabrie called me to ask if I'd do it.  I ended up doing three or so (for
Sonic 55, the Return
of The King special, and Knuckles 11, as I recall).  I tried to keep my flaming
tendencies in check,
but after three months Fred decided to cancel the deal.  Just as well; no way
could I have avoided
massively flaming S56's "Immortality Is Forever."  And as I understand it, aside
from Fan Art
updates, the Sonic part of the Archie comics site has pretty much languished
since the departure
of Paul Castiglia.


<img src="images/bikini.jpg" alt="Cutting Room Floor." align=right>
</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Of all the things you do - you're most known for you reviews of the
book and your fanfiction. Every month, never failing, you pitch out a review
of the comic book. What drives you to keep going? Why do you still read it?
Do you believe that your reviews have impact upon the Sonic community? Why
so?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>There's a part of me that wants to believe that someone in Mamaroneck reads
these things and
possibly takes them to heart.  I know that Archie wants feedback, but a lot of
the letters they get
probably don't say more than "That was kewl!" or "That sucked!" without spelling
out WHY.  I
have sufficient mileage to be able to articulate WHY a story or arc or artwork
worked or didn't,
and I like to think that at some point the creatives will take a cue from that
and make the book all
that it could be.  After something like "Endgame," though, I wonder if it isn't
just an exercise in
talking to myself.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Have the writers and artists ever given you feedback on a review? Do
you think that some of the higher ups at Archie still read them?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Yes, but sometimes not in a good way.  There are times I've gone off half-cocked
and Ken or
someone would have to set me straight.  That happened when I asked out loud
whether there was
any such thing as "quality control" at Archie that would have prevented the
Death Egg #2
disaster.  Paul Castiglia let me know in no uncertain terms that it was the
Canadian printer that
screwed up by oversaturating the reds on certain pages of the issue and making
the thing look
like it was printed with a mixture of ink and mud.  Generally, nobody's gotten
back to me and
said "That's a great idea!"  Though the fact that they put out a "director's
cut" of the final
installment of "Endgame"(which I had tossed off as a suggestion in my review of
S49) tells you
that maybe I come up with SOME good ideas but I should never expect Archie to
acknowledge
them.  The creatives are more likely to rebut certain points than anything else. 
Ken Penders has
been very generous with his time in keeping me informed and occasionally
throwing a spoiler or
two my way, and I appreciate that.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>If Archie made you head/sole writer for the Sonic comics, what
immediate changes would you make? What long-term plans?  (Keep in mind that
Sega will still be watching its characters, especially Sonic, like a hawk.)

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>First off, I'd make sure that there IS a long-term plan.  Archie's been keeping
the creatives on a
short leash, according to Ken's last chat session.  They maybe know what's going
to happen six
months in advance, tops.  Then, too, I don't get a sense of coordination of the
story elements
between Ken and Karl Bollers.  The editor's position, as I understand Justin
Gabrie's description
of it, has more to do with making sure the comic gets produced than with making
sure the
content is solid.  That explains why Justin made such a bonehead statement about
Sally being 5
years younger than Elias when it was obvious they were closer in age.  So that
would be Job 1:
institute more editorial oversight to guarantee tighter continuity and
consistency.

<p>Second, I'd keep Sega out of the loop as much as possible.  The writers mostly
know what
they're doing when provided with the tools.  Sega's interference in stories and
characterizations,
however, have hurt more than helped.  Maybe with Justin Gabrie working in the
belly of the
beast on the Sega payroll, he'll cut the creatives more slack and let them put
out a better book.

<p>That's not to say that Sega would never be consulted.  On the contrary, their
input as to the back
story of the Sonic Adventure game could possibly have redeemed that story arc. 
As it was, Ken
and Karl only had Spaz's game-play notes to go with (until close to the end) and
stumbled around
seeing what would work (such as the whole Mysterious Cat Country plot line,
which pretty much
went nowhere).  If I'd been told that Archie's creatives couldn't have access to
the English game
script I'd have simply told Sega: "Fine.  You'll have your adaptation in about
two years, because
that's how long it's gonna take to figure out the story on our own once the
American game
comes out on the market."

<p>Third, I'd want to plan AT LEAST a year in advance where the story angles are
going and how
they're getting there.  Keeping the writers on a short leash just feeds the
sense that they're
making it up as they go and they have no real feel for the characters as a
result.

<p>Finally, I'm not saying I want to be the SOLE writer, but I'd like to be able to
have more say in
the characterizations.  I want to see the book get away from the "dead behind
the eyes" treatment
of these characters.  The fans are devoted to Sonic, Sally, Tails et al. because
they believe that
these characters DO have personalities, emotions, aspirations.  The writers
should appreciate that
and go with it, even at the risk of losing some of the younger readers.  Heck, a
GOOD writer will
still figure out a way to bring them along without reducing the characters to
cardboard cutouts.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Many people have pretty much agreed that your fanfiction is some of the
BEST on the Sonic internet. This brings out a question that you've probably
heard NUMEROUS times - WHY have you never tried to apply for a writing
position at Archie Comics?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Archie's made it clear that they only talk to other comic book writers, those
who have already
worked in the profession.  Believe me, if they accepted stuff thrown in over the
transom (as they
say in freelancing) I'd have sent them stuff long ago.  My only real hope of
even being noticed
by Archie is to make a success of my serious fiction (a book I'm in the process
of writing now; see
below).   They still may balk, though, because I'm not a COMIC BOOK writer! 
That IMHO is a
sin and a shame.  I think of myself as a writer who is capable of doing comic
books; to call myself
a comic book writer is too confining.  But the short answer is, I don't expect
them to be
contacting me any time soon, especially with the market as soft as it is.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Would you decline the offer if you were accepted? Why?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>No way!  I love writing, whether the reviews, the fanfic, whatever!  I'm not
going to pass up the
chance to get paid for it.  Besides, they tend to engage writers on a freelance
basis, so it means I
wouldn't have to quit my day job.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How do you think Sega should handle the development of its characters
in non-videogame media?  Do they have an obligation to keep Sonic and the
other characters as close to their game personalities as possible,
or do they need to allow the comic/TV/whatever writers freedom to develop
the characters as they see fit?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>What Sega has failed to realize is that ever since the SatAM series, the
characters have left the
nest, cut Mama Sega's apron strings, and have begun to make lives of their own. 
The
relationship between Sonic and Sally is a case in point.  After killing off
Sally, Ken Penders had
planned on turning Sonic into yet one more cliched ronin, one more comic book
loner trying to
follow some ill-defined path or other like an aimless Jedi apprentice.  Big
mistake!  Huge!!
Whether Ken or Sega like it or not, Sally is a part of Sonic's life and vice
versa.  If they're going
to screw with the continuity as it now stands, they'd better have a good reason. 
And from what
I've seen, that's something the creatives and management have very little of.

<p>This is not to say that we can have them do just anything.  It wouldn't do
having Sonic drinking
or fornicating with abandon, in violation of the Code.  Then again, Dan Slott
(in Special #13) set
it up so that Sonic would have to take a life!  And Sega apparently bought into
it!!  So maybe
even Sega doesn't know what to do with Sonic outside of the game grid.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><img src="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/images/screenshots/vgnews/092600/sonicadventure_screen006.jpg" alt="A New Adventure..." align=left><b>SHQ: </b>Do you think the Sonic Adventure influence on the book has it hurt or
helped it? What are your views on the SA adaption so far and how it has been
handled?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Sadly, the greatest influence of Sonic Adventure has been in the area of
character design.  It
appears that Archie isn't programmed to receive the narrative element.  Tikal
(and they have a
hard enough time agreeing on the spelling of her name, which ought to tell you
something!) was
given the "positive feelings" dialogue instead of Tails, so it's as if the
writers are studiously
avoiding letting any of the regulars have anything like insight.  Then again,
Ken and Karl have
been working under the handicap of going mainly by the action of the Japanese
version with no
clue as to the characters' motivation.  So it's been like reviewing a movie with
no sound; you're
missing something there.  I'm afraid that the influence of SA won't extend
beyond the
superficial, even though there's a good idea or two in there somewhere.  After
all, they pretty
much misread the significance of what happened to Tikal and the Chao.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How do you feel about the direction the Sonic comic is now taking, with
the return of Robotnik and the re-establishment of the premise of a group of
underdogs operating out of Knothole to defeat him?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>It actually needs to be played up more.  That situation is so broad, with so
many possibilities,
that the writers should be able to get good traction, particularly if the
stories are also
opportunities to deal with the characters as well as the immediate situation.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Do you think the non-Sega characters from SatAM should be "untouchable"
in the comic (e.g., not killed or roboticized)?  Why or why not?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>The original ensemble should be kept together, yes.  They simply work well
together as a team.
In a recent Sonic-Gram, Justin compared Sonic to a sun around which other
planets (i.e.,
secondary characters) revolve.  It's much more complex of a dance than that. 
Sally is affected by
Sonic, and vice versa.  Bunnie and Antoine are officially an item.  There's
still a LOT of room to
expand on the relationship between Sonic and Tails.  It would be more accurate
to say that
they're the protons at the nucleus of an atom with everybody else as electrons
on the
outer rim.  Besides, killing off a character is IMHO an admission of defeat by a
writer, an
admission that they've run out of ideas WRT that character and just want to get
rid of them
because they're a nuisance.  That's why the "death" of Lupe left such a bad
taste in my mouth.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Mike Gallagher roboticised Sonic and Knuckles and set off Robotropolis
with a nuclear warhead. Karl Bollers sent Sonic and Tails on a world tour
after a gremlin named Ixis Naugus and a plot device named Nate Morgan. Ken
Penders tried to kill Sally to no avail, so he killed Robotnik instead.
Sonic Adventure came along and the artwork and story took on a more stylized
look to fit that of the Dreamcast game. What did you think about these
specific eras of the comic? Were they good or bad? How could they have been
done better in your opinion? Do you like this new "stylization" and did you consider any of
these as a breath of fresh air in terms of creativity and writing?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b><b>Gallagher:</b> Again, this was a symptom of a lack of editorial direction.  What he
did was valid
plotwise, but it had about as much consequence as a character getting conked by
an anvil in a
Warner Brothers cartoon!  It just wasn't serious writing.  I know Gallagher is
capable of doing
serious stuff from his recent "Sonic Kids" stories, but this was simply bad
writing IMHO.

<p><b>The Round The World Tour:</b> This was Archie's chance to showcase Sonic and Tails
away from
the Freedom Fighters, and the creatives squandered it.  The book simply wasn't
that interesting,
at least not as interesting as it could have been.  Part of that was due to
internal problems beyond
Archie's control: about that time Nelson Ortega said "Sorry, I'm outta here" so
Archie had to
scramble to cover the disruption in their schedule.  But it became clear to me
that Sonic and Tails
couldn't carry a comic book all by themselves; they NEEDED the rest of the
ensemble cast.

<p><b>Endgame:</b> I honestly don't think Ken thought through the ramifications of killing
off Sally, and
what happened to what was supposed to be his "masterpiece" was tragic (for a
writer) but also
carried a certain poetic justice in that what had been a powerful if
controversial idea turned into a
dogpile.

<p><b>Robotnik Redux:</b> Yet one more triumph of style over substance.  Apart from
bringing the
continuity in line with Sega's product there was no real reason to make the
changes that SA
required.

<p>In short, these strike me as individual ideas that could have been better
executed rather than
elements in a carefully-considered development of the story.  They're making it
up as they go, in
other words.  Some of the ideas Ken has thrown into the mix (Elias, the fate of
Queen Alicia) are
actually far more compelling and can be even more so if the writers ever get
around to
developing them under the influence of some coherent editorial direction.  The
writers are just
floundering now, grabbing onto anything that'll float.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><img src="images/tomato.jpg" alt="Tom-ay-toe, To-Mah-Toe" align=right><b>SHQ: </b>A lot of people have referred to Nate Morgan as the "Bill Cosby of the
Sonic Comics Universe". What are your flat out honest views on Karl Bollers' "Nate
Morgan"? Do you believe he is a duex ex machina or a self insertion
character?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Nate's introduction was mishandled from the get-go.  He was never that tragic a
figure as the
original story arc wanted him to be; that's why he probably should have bought
the farm instead
of Eddy the Yeti.  Now he spends his days as a walking plot device with nothing
going on behind
the eyes.  If he IS a self-insertion character, it's a tacit admission that Karl
Bollers is a boring
guy!  I'm still convinced that the real reason he was thrown in was to try and
soften the notion
that this is, at heart, a furry book. The character has added no complexity to
the story or its
characters, which is hard enough to do when you have no sense of editorial
direction to begin
with.  Sadly, he's been reduced to being the token hyoomon.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you think is the best Sonic comic Archie has ever done? What do
you think is the worst? Explain why and compare to the Sonic book of
yesterday to the Sonic book of today? In your opinion, what did they do
right and what did they do wrong?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Best issue: #18. "Wedding Bell Blues" was a Gallagher romp with a twist and not
without a
certain amount of charm.  I've already expressed my appreciation for "In The
Still Of The
Night."

<p>Worst Issue: the "Battle Royal" special.  The cover story was a mindless fight
exercise with a
heavy dollop of cynicism.  "The Map" was Gallagher's attempt to retool Antoine
as an action
hero, and it failed miserably because not only did it totally misread Antoine's
character it didn't
even hang on to the few bits about him (any notion of chivalry, for instance)
that could have
redeemed him.

<p>I find it hard to think in terms of individual issues, though, because sometimes
the cover story
can be a bomb (and not in terms of being "da bomb") while the back story shows
signs of
intelligence.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What is your belief on death in the Sonic comics in general? Is it
necessary? Has the book become depressing because of the deaths that had
taken place?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I was depressed by Sally's "death" at the beginning of "Endgame," because I'd
come to care
about the character. And Julayla's death was handled well.  For the most part,
though, the deaths
of characters have been badly mishandled in the comic.  Characters have been
snuffed out
because the plot called for it (Steppenwolf, Charmy's friend) or for reasons
unrevealed to the
reader (Lupe).  But even in manga and anime, where character deaths happen and
may or may
not have meaning, there is NEVER a sense that a death has no consequences. 
Sonic kills
someone, and the results?  Nothing!  That's one of the worst parts about "Zone
Wars: Giant
Robotno." Sonic took a life and because it happened in an alternate reality it's
supposed to be
meaningless!  Maybe it's a Code thing, I don't know, but the creatives don't
have a good track
record in this area.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Of the authors and artists below give your opinion on their run on the
Sonic comic. Their ups and downs, good and bads. What is the best and worst
thing they have done in terms of the book?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b><b>Ken Penders</b> - 
Ken is a good writer with (of course) his own take on who the characters are and
where they
should be going.  That has been influenced by exposure to other comic book
writers -- the work
of Eisner, Lee and Kirby.  Because he defaults to these writers when plotting
necessitates it, the
results can be less than satisfying.  He needs to accept that the characters he
has to work with
here can be far more complex than what he's used to, and that he doesn't have to
be afraid of that
complexity.  He's only allowed it to show through on rare occasions, and then
mainly with
subsidiary characters (Bunnie in "Upgrade,"  Julie-Su in the "First date" arc)
rather than the
franchise (Sonic, Tails).  That, of course, may be more a function of getting
slapped down by
Sega than anything else.

<p><b>Mike Gallagher</b> -
Like the little girl with the little curl, he can be either VERY good ("Eve of
Destruction," "My
Secret Guardian") or mind-numbingly horrible ("Some Enchantra Evening," "The
Map").  He's
capable of far more than jokey little filler stories and has demonstrated a real
grasp of the
characters.  "Opposites Detract" (S59) shows what he's capable of, and even the
otherwise
deplorable "Outback Gut Check" (S61), with its weak plotting and Barby's creepy
romantic
interest in Tails, showed that Gallagher has some interesting story ideas by
dropping the
reference to the bunyip.  My only guess is that he, like all the creatives,
lacks a sense of editorial
direction.

<p><b>Karl Bollers</b> - 
Needs to become way more familiar with the characters, which are the heart and
soul of the
book.  His ability to survive during the Sonic Adventure adaptation (where he
and Ken mainly
had the notes of the gameplay from the Japanese version to fall back on)
demonstrates that he can
handle action.  His painful weakness, however, is his vanishing ability to make
the reader care
about Sonic and the gang.  It shone through in "Running To Stand Still" (S54)
whereupon it
appears to have been smothered to death by the management.

<p><b>Patrick Spaziante</b> - 
Top-notch sense of design, even if his page layouts are a little non-linear at
times.  But I applaud
his audacity.

<p><b>James Fry</b> -
The anime/manga influence comes through, and I have NO problem with that!  He's
been a
welcome addition.  My biggest complaint is that he's had to double-team with
other artists such
as Nelson Ribiero (on "Zone Wars: Giant Robotno," for instance).  It's probably
a deadline thing.

<p><b>Sam Maxwell</b> -
There's still something a little too loose about his style; half the time he
makes his characters
look like balloon animals, and his minimalist backgrounds give the impression
(true or not) of
either haste or laziness.  It's not fair for me to judge, since I'm no artist
myself.  His most recent
work has improved greatly.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>It's known amongst Sonic fans that you have a particular affinity for
Sonic SatAM. What draws you to it more than the others?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Aside from the sheer quality of the art, the writing, the voice work, it took
itself seriously enough
that it never degenerated into absurdity.  It also had a strong premise and the
sense to allow the
characters to be highlighted as the occasion called for it.  It simply worked
for me.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you truly feel about Sonic Underground and AoStH?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>SU has to live in the shadow of the SatAM series, with fewer resources.  You
could tell it from
the voice casting.  Aside from Jaleel White doing triple duty as Sonic and BOTH
his sibs, and
Maurice LaMarche as Sleet (mainly doing a Peter Lorre impersonation), the voice
work was
unremarkable.  In the SatAM series, they even got good work from veteran actor
William
Windom as Uncle Chuck.  Here, the voice work for Robotnik was unremarkable and
that's
NOT a good sign.  Other problems included:

<p>The Queen's voiceover at the beginning of most of the eps.  The sibs looking for
their mom was
supposed to be one of the emotional hooks for the series, but having her
introduce each ep pretty
much drained the emotional tension out of it.  Besides, by the time I saw my
first ep I'd already
been exposed to the gimmick at the beginnings of each episode of Nelvana's
"Franklin" series.  I
kept expecting to hear Queen Aleena say: "My children could count by twos and
tie their
shoes...."

<p>Those stupid music videos: Musical numbers, in the wrong hands, are usually an
invitation to
bring an animated film or TV show to a screeching halt, and SU was no exception. 
According to
Mark Lungo, someone who's spoken to people involved with the series and who sent
me a tape
of selected eps, a lot of the musical numbers were plugged into the shows
because there's been a
musical number in the previous ep.  It didn't matter if the music was wrong for
the occasion, that
it might have been upbeat in an ep where a ballad would have been more
appropriate, they HAD
to throw one in and accompany it with a lot of trick special effects.


<p>"Adventures of..." was something else entirely.  Making not the slightest
attempt to take itself
seriously, it careened from joke to joke for the most part.  Much of it has
faded from memory
except for a few bits: Da Bears (I remember that as I'm from Chicago
originally); the ep "Tails'
New Home" where the relationship between Tails and Sonic is explored along with
how they met
up; the "Zootropolis" ep, which was totally bizarre and which involved a
galactic hunter babe
getting the hots for Robotnik (Go figure!).



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><img src="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Dell/6657/segatop.gif" alt="The Dynamic Duo!" align=left><b>SHQ: </b>Have you ever played the videogames? What do you think of them and the
latest Sonic Adventure?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Since getting a PC with enough muscle to handle it, I've been playing the Sonic
and Knuckles
collection on CD-ROM.  I'm pretty miserable at it: I've gotten Sonic to the
Flying Battery Zone
(where he dies a quick death), and the Marble Garden Zone (where he's been
getting crushed as
the city collapses).  Tails still hasn't got the knack of taking out Robotnik in
the
Hydrocity Zone, nor can I get Knuckles out of Mushroom Hill or the Carnival
Night zones.  But
Sonic Adventure (which I have NOT played; there's no way I could justify the
expense of getting
a Dreamcast) at least has more of a back story than the other games which mainly
consist of
getting from Point A to Point B.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Do you think that Sega and DiC truly care about the Sonic character
anymore?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Yes, but like parents who refuse to admit that their children have grown up they
see them merely
as game characters and licensed properties rather than as characters that have
taken on a life of
their own thanks to the SatAM series and fan interest.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How much influence does Sega have in the comic? Is too much a bad
thing? How much influence do you think Archie has on Sega, Sonic wise? Do
you think Sega Of America is partly responsible for Sonic's lower popularity
today?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>IMHO, Sega is being too controlling of a character who could make a solid
impression if the
creatives had a freer hand.  But as long as Sonic is licensed by Sega, Archie
can't veto any of
Sega's directives.  I can only hope that with Justin Gabrie working for them
now, he'll be able to
intercede and cut the creatives a little more slack.  But don't bet cash money
on it.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What initially inspired you to start writing, specifically Sonic? Have
you written anything else not Sonic? Has there been anything else, past or
present, that has helped to inspire you in writing your stories?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Before Sonic, I'd actually written some Care Bears fanfic.  The show was
something of a guilty
pleasure of mine.  It helped me, I think, in that the characters were SO spelled
out and so definite
that writing for them wasn't too complicated.  After all, when you deal with
characters with names
like Grumpy Bear and Friend Bear, your options are pretty limited.

<p>Inspiration, for Sonic or non-Sonic, is one of those intangibles that varies
from work to work.  I
think I saw some fanfic being posted on an old Sonic list and simply thought,
"Let me take a
crack at it."  How the first story, "Bloodlines," evolved exactly I'm not too
sure.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How do you come up with your plot ideas for your fanfiction?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>It varies.  The inspiration for "First Honor" was a description of a Wiccan rite
involving an
offering of milk to the Earth Mother Goddess or something.  That somehow mutated
into my
idea for a Mobian Mother's Day ritual, and the rest of the story was built on
that.  "A Matter of
Trust" sprang from a desire to work a badger into the continuity, a badger who
ended up being
loosely modeled on a Klingon.  "Space Case" began with the image of a body being
dumped out
of one of Robotnik's haulers; at about the same time I discovered a book here in
the library that
explained epilepsy to children, and the two ideas came together.  "Back Upon
Itself" was written
simply as a reaction to Justin's totally unsatisfactory explanation of the age
difference between
Sally and Elias.  Like I say, it varies.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>One of your most talked about fanfics depicted Sally walking into a
meat locker. However, the "hanging meat" wasn't just the typical meat in a
freezer. They were actual dead Mobians which put a new spin on the source of
Doc Robotnik's weight gain. What inspired the scene for that and why did you
add it to the story? Did you feel it pertinent? Impact perhaps?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I may have been a little too influenced by Bill Holbrook's excellent e-strip,
"Kevin and Kell,"
wherein an herbivore is married to a carnivore and the preditor-prey
relationship is played up
considerably.  It may also have something to do with my interest in the
Holocaust, which was
certainly horrific enough.  Or maybe it was a simple matter of my rushing in
where angels feared
to tred.  Since Steve Butler has further fanned the flame in S83 by depicting a
meat wagon in one
panel, I don't know whether to take credit for it or not.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>This is the time to plug yourself. ^__^ Why should the Sonic fandom
read your fanfics? What, in your eyes, makes your fanfiction special?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I like to think it's because I do good work, that I've lived long enough to
bring experience (in
writing and in real life) to my work that most other fans (being teenagers or
thereabouts) simply
don't have.  It's sort of my way of saying: "It's OK to like this stuff; you
don't have to feel that
you've got to outgrow it at some point."  Writing it keeps me young in some
respects.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>"Mobius Apocalypse" depicted what would be a possible "final days of
Knothole". Bunnie was "disconnected", Antoine died a hero's death saving
Tails, Knuckles pretty much went insane at one point, and virtually every
character was put through the wringer 10 times over with only ONE FF left at
the end. What inspired this story and why did you write it?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I don't know WHAT I was thinking!  Except possibly that I thought that I
couldn't keep this up
forever.  So I asked myself: "If I had to wrap this whole thing up once and for
all, what would
happen?"  My basic conclusion was that someone would somehow have to hit the
Cosmic Reset
Button, and that's what the story basically accomplished: it set up the
possibility of a world
where Robotnik had never made the scene.  I've actually gotten some heat for
that ending from
one fan who insists that the characters wouldn't be who they are had they not
gone through
whatever they did to bring them to the "present."  I can see his point, and like
I said there are
moments when I have to wonder why I went ahead with it.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><img src="images/bunnie2.jpg" alt="Is Ya'll Talkin' Bout Li'l Ol Me, Sugah?!" align=right><b>SHQ: </b>You have a "thing" for Bunnie - don'tcha? ^___^ Another fanfic, "When A
Bunnie Meets A Bunnie" depicted Evil Sonic's Anti-Mobius in a manner never
seen before in the comics. In fact the concept of "The Anti-Bunnie" had
never been seen there at all. Why do you think Archie avoids it and what was
your inspiration for her?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>It's a flat-out plot hole: if Robotnik Prime roboticizes Mobians for the purpose
of enslaving them,
what possible motive for roboticizing anyone would a benign Robotnik have? 
That's why
Kanterovich and Penders (creators of the Antisonic) side-stepped the issue.  Me,
I couldn't leave
well enough alone.  I had to figure out whether Bunnie would be partially
roboticized in that
world and how she'd relate to the other characters.  The story grew from that. 
And yes, Bunnie is
probably my favorite character, between the character design and Christine
Cavanaugh's superb
voice work, I was a goner. ;)



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you think about the new comics on Team Artail based on your
stories? Do you have any input into the creation of those, aside from the
story itself?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>It's a little humbling to see my stories being illustrated by others.  I've
never had reason to
consult with or direct the artists; they're doing their thing as I did mine. 
Sometimes I find myself
wondering if working on these comics keeps them from having a life; other times
I'm surprised
that I wrote something that good!


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>In terms of your fanfiction, what do you feel has been your best
produced work and your worst produced work?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>The best I'd have to say was "Capture The Flag."  It was certainly the most fun,
because Archie
hadn't written any Sonic Kids stories by that point and I was sort of blazing
the trail.  And I
couldn't rely on new characters to get me out of any jams.  The worst would be
"The Body In
Question" because the idea for that one came from an outside source.  I think I
did all right by it,
but it didn't come from the heart.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>How much re-writing do you do on the average story? What length of a
story do you recommend for the general reading public?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>ALWAYS assume that there will be rewriting; not even the great writers get it
right the first
time.  Up to one-third of your material will probably be revised before you're
done.  I always
print out a rough draft and re-do it until I'm satisfied.  A good story length
is between 12 and 20
pages, more if you really need to go there.  "Runaway" was exceptional as that
weighed in at
over 90 pages when it was done; that was more of a Sonic novella than a short
story.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you think of Sonic fanfiction in general (not yours)?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Given that the writers are mainly students and just starting out, I recognize
that they need to be
cut some slack.  While their outlook isn't mine (nor could it hope to be) I'm
glad that they're
writing at all!  Some stories try to be great and succeed; others need a lot of
work.  I usually tend
to look past what I call the "mechanical errors" (spelling, punctuation, like
that) at the story
itself.  That's what an editor does, really.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What are your views between where the Sonic comic has been - i.e Moving
away from The Sonic SatAM Cartoon continuity to its own continuity set up by
Mr. Bollers and Mr. Penders? Why do you think that Sonic fans (well, at
least half of them anyway) show so much animosity at major changes that
deviate from the original SatAM Storyline while the other half want more
Japanese Segasonic influence?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>The fans wouldn't be upset if the creatives managed to give them product that
knocked their
socks off.  Archie can move away from the SatAM continuity all they want so long
as the place
they're going TO is worth the effort.  And since there appears to be no clear
idea as to where the
book IS going, why bother making the trip?  Better to stay with the SatAM
continuity and try to
get it right.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Robotnik's old look (SatAM) VS Robotnik's new look (Sonic Adventure)?
Honestly - what do you think is better? ^_^


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>The SA Robotnik actually looks slightly comic compared to the Classic (SatAM)
Robotnik.  In
that regard, it's hard to take him seriously as a villain, which is where the
old-style Robotnik had
the advantage.  Of course the AoStH Robotnik looked like a buffoon version of
the old Robotnik
and makes the SA Robotnik look good by comparison.  On the whole, the SatAM
Robotnik
looks more like a villain to be reckoned with.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Do you think the Sonic fandom - internet fandom specifically - helps or
hinders the process and longevity of the comics? In your opinion - how much
voice does the Sonic Internet fandom really have?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>It's hard to tell what percentage of the sales are attributable to Net fans. 
We're still considered to
be a minority of the book's client base in terms of numbers, though I like to
think that the broader
RL audience will be more likely to grow out of the book and to abandon it as a
childish thing
before the Net fans do.  My fear is that because a kid audience is so easy to
please, that gives the
creatives license to keep their expectations low.  I'm also afraid that the
Bottom Line trumps all
other considerations.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What has been your most memorable (good and bad) experience with Sonic
fandom both in real life and on the internet?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>The best experience was the good reception of "Bloodlines."  It told me I was on
to something
here.  The worst has been dealing with mindless flames sent by pro-Mario trolls.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Who were some of your favorite writers that you looked up to? How have
they influenced you?

</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Richard Adams' "Watership Down" was a pivotal book for me; probably the greatest
furry novel
of all time.  Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff," even though it was nonfiction, was
more compelling
than a lot of contemporary fiction.  C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia were
very influential to
me in my college years   I literally couldn't put down the final book in the
series, "The Last
Battle," until I'd finished it.   When I was in grade school I was very much
into Edgar Allen Poe,
back before they called it "Goth."

<p>But I think the writer that had the most impact on me was the American humorist
and cartoonist,
James Thurber.  His work was excellent, insightful, entertaining.  Here's one
sentence from his
story "The Night The Bed Fell": "Old Aunt Melissa Beall, who could whistle like
a man with
two fingers in her mouth, suffered under the premonition that she was destined
to die on South
High Street, since she'd been born on South High Street and married on South
High Street."
That's one of the most marvelous sentences in all of American literature!  It
says so much about
the character of Thurber's aunt; it's absolutely perfect.  From Thurber I
learned what writing
could be.



</font><p><img src="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/images/screenshots/dc/sonic2/sonic2_b2_screen005.jpg" alt="Darn it all, I can never get this stupid button to work!!!" align=left><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What basic advice would you give a young writer?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Read.  Everything!  Fiction, non-fiction, whatever.  Don't just read other
comics, either.  I like to
think that one of the reasons my fanfics work is that I'm not thinking of
writing a comic but a
serious piece of fiction instead.  Pay attention to all those boring grammar and
language rules in
high school: use them as tools to help yourself communicate.  And actually write
something.  If
you think it's good enough, check out the latest "Writer's Market" at the
library and see if you
can't get it published somewhere.  Even if it's rejected, use the experience to
sharpen your craft.


</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What makes writing fun? What part of your job do you like best? ^_^


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Sometimes it's NOT fun, especially when you're proofreading your copy for the
20th time and it
starts to get old.  For me, the biggest kick is the surprise in the act of
writing: starting to type
something the way you've thought it out and then realizing "Wait a second: doing
B would work
better than doing A here!"  It's watching the story grow and open up before your
eyes, in ways
you may not have expected.  That's a kick.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you consider your biggest positives/strengths and
negatives/weaknesses in your writing? Do you feel that you can improve - if
so how? What fields do you think you don't need to improve on?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>My strength is my age and experience.  I think I can do more with a story than
simply adapt
Sonic and Tails to the action of the latest movie, simply because I've seen more
in the course of
my 48 years than most other fans.  I sometimes think that my characters lack
subtlety and I
should probably work on that.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What are your future plans for your career? We had heard from you a
while ago that you were in the process of writing a book? What is it called
and whats it about?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>The book, called "One Small Light," is basically about the relationship between
a very young
boy and a very old man.  It's based on the first three chapters of the First
Book of Samuel from
the Bible, wherein the prophet Samuel, at age 4 (according to the historian
Josephus), is left in
the care of the 90-year-old High Priest Eli.  It's a historical novel which also
serves as a vehicle
to teach the reader something about the Judaism of 3,000 years ago as well as
life during the Late
Bronze Period.  Right now the rough draft of the book is in the hands of a
publisher; they should
be determining its fate some time in late October.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What do you think about the Knuckles comic dying?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>"Rugrats" is a hot show now, and it has been for a couple years, but the fact is
that it premiered
in 1991.  Nickelodeon was willing to stand by it until it became an "overnight
sensation."  The
lack of that kind of commitment to both Sonic and Knuckles killed the Knuckles
book and could
very well kill the Sonic book one day.  Management, at Archie and Sega, has to
loosen up and
give the creatives permission to do their best.  Instead, they cut what they
perceived to be their
losses at the first opportunity.  That's what killed the Knuckles book, and it
was a crime.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>What fanfics are you working on right now? When will some new ones be
out? ;O)


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Right now, time is the tyrant and keeping me from doing much of anything in the
way of fanfic,
but I have some ideas:

<p>"Zone Wars: Break Point": Just as "Back Upon Itself" was sparked by Justin's
remark, so this
story would be a "sequel" to "Zone Wars: Giant Robotno." Sonic shows the effects
of having
taken a life, and he and Tails face their doom as a result.  Dan Slott might
protest the use of his
character and situations...but there's an industry-wide practice of NOT reading
fanfic for fear of
triggering a lawsuit at a future date so what he doesn't know won't hurt him. ;)

<p>"Julie-Xu: Warrior Echidna": In a time of gods and heroes and bitchin' leather
outfits....  I've
been planning to do a Xena parody starring Julie-Su for some time, but the show
itself has gotten
SO anachronistic of late it's in danger of parodying itself.

<p>Untitled: The Forbidden Zone Arc (K19-21) is one of my all-time favorites, and
it inspires this
account of the young Elias arriving at the Summersby's doorstep and how they get
along.  In the
beginning, they don't.  My working on "One Small Light" may have had more than a
little
influence on the premise.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Has your work or Sonic changed you in any way? How have you evolved as
a writer, a teacher, and a person because of it?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>It's allowed me to actually have a hobby, and to admit to myself that I can
legitimately enjoy
something ostensibly aimed at a younger demographic.  As a faculty member, I've
had to
discipline myself not to write reviews and fanfic on company time.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>If you had the choice to be in any other career, what would it be?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>I really like librarianship, so I can't picture myself doing anything else.  I
HAVE left instructions
with my wife, however, that if I ever have to get a job in sales she has my
permission to shoot
me. ;)




</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>Who is your favorite Freedom Fighter?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>Ultimately, Sally.  She's smart, cool, level-headed.  But it's a toss-up between
her and Bunnie.



</font><p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>And finally - What kind of challenge would you like to pursue now? And
what is your greatest achievement in the field of work you're in?


</font><p><font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><b>MR. DRAZEN: </b>My job is really kind of dead end, but I've no desire to do anything else just
yet.  I hope the book
takes off, though I don't expect it to be HUGE in the manner of Steven King or
J. K. Rowling.  If
I become a name within the denomination and get to tour camp meetings during the
summer,
that'll be enough for the moment.

<hr width=100%>

<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>For an encore, Mr. Drazen we'd like to ask if you can give a list of favorites
to
wrap this all up. ^_^

<font color=002B2B face=arial size=2><p>Favorite Films: </b>Casablanca; The Blues Brothers; Raiders of the Lost Ark; The
Last Unicorn;
2001; The Shining (when I'm in a creepy mood); Kiki's Delivery Service; Karate
Kid II.

<p>Favorite Singers And Music: Anything by the Beatles, almost anything by the
Beach Boys
including "Kokomo," hippie music [Scott McKenzie's "San Francisco," The
Youngbloods' "Get
Together"], any cut off the Grateful Dead's "American Beauty," Elton John, and
IMHO the most
beautiful sad song ever, Stevie Ray Vaughn's cover of "Little Wing" by Jimi
Hendrix because
BOTH of those gentlemen are no longer with us.  Lately I've found myself getting
into reggae.

<p>Favorite TV: "Law & Order," "ER," "M*A*S*H" reruns (because they were so
well-written),
"Powerpuff Girls," and C-SPAN's "Washington Journal."  The last one represents
one of the last
bastions of political kookery on television as people phone in and state their
political case.  One
of the defining moments on that show during the Clinton Impeachment affair was
when a woman
called in and fervently declared that "Jesus Christ will remove Bill Clinton
from office."
Obviously, the Lord had better things to do.

<p>Favorite Books: Watership Down, The Right Stuff, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone, The
Chronicles of Narnia, any of the "Straight Dope" books by Cecil Adams, "The
Guide of the
Perplexed" by Moses ben Maimon aka Maimonides.

<p>Favorite Videogames: "Double Dragon" because I have been able to get through the
arcade game
on only one quarter just by giving everyone the Elbow of Doom.  I also play
"Tekken 3" at the
local laundromat and I always play as Kuma the bear even though I know I'll only
end up going
4 rounds.  When you're a fur you're a fur all the way....

<p><font color=blue face=arial size=2><b>SHQ: </b>And lastly your closing statements to the Sonic HQ Staff on their
anniversary and any Sonic fans reading today: ^_^
