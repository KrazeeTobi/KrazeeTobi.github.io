<p>Hi everyone! Just a note to inform you that today I took the liberty of restyling our editorials a bit. 
I converted our latest two editorials into html format so that in the future it would give them an overall better look and design similar to our current theme.

<p>Also included are new submission guidelines, as well as the option to place pictures within your editorial! ^_^ 
I encourage everyone who frequents here to follow the guidelines and write an editorial if you feel you have something you want to speak out on. Rebuttals are encouraged - after all: editorials are opinions. ^_^
So you may begin re-submitting now! Hope you like it.

<p><b>Todays newest editorial:</b> A sonic fan from down under, Knux Of Australia, takes a look at the impending doom of the Dreamcast as Sega Ozisoft flubs again with its rampant delays. Is the dreamcast really going to fail in Australia?
Also Tristan's old editorial on Bernie Stolar's departure is the first to get a facelift, with previous editorials soon to follow suit within the week. You may click our source link below or follow the Editorials Archive link button on the 
sidebar to read them. Later!

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Two days ago, as one of our news bytes, we got a report saying that Sonikku, maintainer of the Sonic Robo Blast fan game had vanished, leaving AJ Freda to take over the project. 
Well it seems he hasn't quite slipped into limbo per an email that was sent to me a day ago:

<p><i>Hi, Sonikku here...In regard to your news item on Sonic HQ -

<p>Nope, I am still alive, right now I'm moving house and can't update the
page personally for a while - I will be online from my Dreamcast and school 
Internet accounts... but I'm not sure about my home address - I can
only access it once a week. AJ suggested that I'd vanished and died (O_o), 
when in fact it was something far less sinister.

<p>Until everything is cleared up, I'll have to wait until next Monday to see 
if I can update the page - even then I'll have to send it to AJ or Mach, 
who will be looking after the page in my abscene. To make up for all this 
however, we've released a sneak preview of SRB2, bear in mind that this 
isn't the finished product and we've still got a lot of bugs to iron out, 
but if you've been sitting around at STJr waiting for something
big to happen, this should last for now. I had a quick go and got a time
 of 0:56, which should esaily be beaten by anyone with a pair of thumbs.
 ;-)

<p>If you want to contact me (Sonikku) now, I have two addresses, I suggest
 the first address if possible -
<br>
<br>1) <a href=mailto:96wallbankj@kinghenry8.coventry.sch.uk>96wallbankj@kinghenry8.coventry.sch.uk</a>
<br>2) <a href=mailto:sonikku@uk.dreamcast.com>sonikku@uk.dreamcast.com</a>

<p>Thanks for the update on your whereabouts Sonikku!

Well, six words. <b>Big improvement over the proto types.</b> Sonic's giant wobbly head problem seemingly has been resolved, Knuckles no longer looks cock-eyed, and Tails' chubby little snout has left. Also, they did a good job with the final painting of the figures. And, those little Power Ring and Emblem accessories look cool.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Sega of America continues to push special downloads and online events in lieu of true online gaming. The latest events include a new set of download-able game elements and online activities that will be accessible only through Sonic Adventure.

<p>The list of new interactive items includes the Sonic World rankings, where gamers from around the world can upload their best scores and times to a database for achievement-based ranking. Just announced today is a Sonic 2K contest, an online event that will include downloads of special Sonic Adventure levels. You'll be able to run through these levels to try and earn the best times, which will be posted on the Sonic Adventure homepage. The contest runs through October 15 to January 14, 2000; the winners will take home a variety of prizes, including a year of free Internet Access from AT&T WorldNet Service and plenty of Sega Dreamcast merchandise, from T-shirts to games. Another online feature for Sonic Adventure is holiday-specific downloads, such as the current Halloween one that adds jack-o'-lanterns and new banners to Twinkle Park (Tremble Park respectively - VERY corny, but it fits the season).

<p>"Sega's plan is to continue to phase in online gameplay elements, giving consumers new experiences never seen before on a console," says Charles Bellfield, director of marketing communications, Sega of America, "Sonic Adventure is the first of many games that will be given additional `arms and legs' through the Internet."

<p><a href=http://pocket.ign.com/>Pocket IGN</a> has just gotten word from Majesco that the plans to relaunch the Sega Game Gear handheld and select library of games has been pushed to sometime next year. The only reason given was that the company wants to restructure its strategy on rereleasing such a product to market. Majesco Sales still plans on releasing the unit, but there is currently no release date. 
Majesco acquired the rights to Sega's Game Gear handheld and Saturn console last year after huge success relaunching the Sega Genesis in a new, redesigned system. The Game Gear relaunch would have been the same unit that was released in the early 90s, and the titles would have most likely been non-licensed popular Sega released games, like Sonic the Hedgehog, Columns, Decap Attack, and other non-Disney and Warner Bros. titles released in the system's four year lifetime.

We'll keep you posted on any news regarding the Game Gear relaunch.

This isn't exactly Sonic news, but it was nice enough to put up. For those of you that didn't know - Patrick Spaziante, cover artist for the Sonic The Hedgehog comic by Archie is also cover artist for Gamefan magazine! 
On this months issue Spaz has drawn his first "Nintendo Game" character cover for Gamefan magazine: being none other than the characters for the upcoming Donkey Kong 64! Could Super Mario be far behind? :)

<p>If enough people ask for it, we can begin creating a Spaz Gamefan cover archive in our Downloads section so you can see all the work he's done on Mortal Kombat, Zombie Revenge, Rayman, etc etc. ^_^

<b><font face="arial">Ken Penders On Future Knuckles Lineup, Sally's Death, The Sonic Adventure Crossover, and Future Sonic Stories</font></b> - WB 12:30 am CST, 10-28-99</font></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Ken Penders' recently released A TON of information concerning the latest developments of the <b>Sonic The Hedgehog</b> comic after the Knuckles cancellation, along with bring up the old topic of just WHY he planned on killing Princess Sally at the end of "Endgame":

<p><LI> <b>Future Knuckles Lineup</b> - <i>Okay, now for some good news. I wrapped up work on the script to <b>KNUCKLES: THE BEST OF TIMES, THE WORST OF TIMES</b> and turned it into Archie's offices earlier today. It's 26 pages long, and features just about every major character you can think of, including the only Guardian who has never been seen or mentioned in the series before. It's got romance, drama, action, suspense, humor and one walloper of an ending. It is currently scheduled to see print in SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #14, and Steven will begin drawing it probably the start of next week.

<p>The final caption in the story reads: "The adventure continues in the pages of SONIC #86, as we and KNUCKLES embark on... THE ROAD TO ALBION."</i> (News Note - "The 3 part "Road To Albion" trilogy was originally due to take place in Knuckles 35 before the cancellation.)

<p><i>So those of you who think Knuckles is only going to make token appearances in the SONIC series are mistaken. The stories will feature the same continuity and style of stories you've been following all this time. Sure, it's only eight pages a month, but it's better that than nothing at all, wouldn't you think?

<p>As for <b>KNUCKLES: TWENTY YEARS LATER</b>, now that I've wrapped production on THE LOST ONES #1, I'm spending the next couple of weeks concentrating exclusively on that one, and it is scheduled to see print in SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #16. (If we can move it up, we will, but for now, this is the best we can do.) Again, this one has some major surprises and revelations.
</i>

<p><LI> <b>Sonic Super Special And Super Secret Special</b> - <i> I can't compare writing Sonic with Knuckles because both experiences have been so different, that anything I say would sounfd more in favor of Knuckles. However, I've never lost my fondness for Sonic as a character, and i have some major league plans for him. Let's just say that when the Super Special, Spaz and I are working on finally does see print, that should finally put to rest any questions on what my feelings are for Sonic.
it'll be the wildest Sonic story yet, in more ways than one. The approach further defines the character as an iconic hero. To say more at this time would really spoil a lot of surprises at this time.

<p>SSS#12 was supposed to be a part of the Sonic Adventure adaptation, but that's been pushed back to #13, and now #12 is just a collection of stories we've been waiting to use, including the Comic Shop News 14-parter. #14 leads off with KNUCKLES: THE BEST OF TIMES, THE WORST OF TIMES, which is 26-pages in length. As for the rest of that issue, we haven't decided what to fill the rest of the pages up with. #15 or 17 will feature the SONIC story Spaz and I have been working on, and #16 will feature KNUCKLES: TWENTY YEARS LATER.
</i>

<p><LI> <b>Sonic Adventure In The Comics</b> - <i> In the SA crossover, Sonic and Knuckles will be sort of sharing the spotlight, and this game adaption won't be like the last (i.e. Sonic & Knuckles, Triple Trouble) where Sonic does very little at all.
Both characters are very much in the thick of the action. Also, the segments with Knuckles are not only an adaptation, but also continue the regular Knuckles continuity as well. (You're finally going to see the Mysterious Cat Country mentioned in the Brave New World Special, for one thing.)

<p>Usually, the most we ever see of a game BEFORE it comes out are a few pieces of production artwork and an outline of the story. That's it. We were lucky Spaz had a Japanese version of Sonic Adventure for us to work from, and even that wasn't as much help as we would have liked. We have asked Sega to supply us with all the necessary material to do the stories right, but nobody outside of the Licensing Department seems to think it important enough to do so.
</i>

<p><LI> <b>Future Tales Of The Great War?</b> - When asked on the concept of Sonic's parents getting married in the comic book, Ken had this to say: 

<p><i>The Great War took several years, allowing Bernie and Jules the time to court (albeit a short time to do so) and get married. That just happened to be one detail I overlooked. Reading your post however gave me the inspiration to do a story about that very subject. I now just have to figure where and when it'll see print. </i>

<p><LI> <b>Why Ken Wanted To Kill Sally</b> - <i>Sega wanted to spare Sally Acorn on the premise they might still market her as a video game character aimed at the female market. Simple as that.
As for why I felt Sally was holding back Sonic, it's more due to the inherit flaw in the premise of her being Sonic's superior. If he goes against her wishes too many times, he comes off as petulant and disobedient. On the flip side, if he tows the line too much, he risks being called a wuss. The name of the book is SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, not SONIC & SALLY, and so the hero has to have a certain amount of autonomy in order for the series to work.

<p>Part of the problem with writing Sonic (as well as Knuckles) is that he's a lone wolf, much like Spider-Man was in the early days, and yet the readers like to see him interact with friends and family. Lone wolves don't have much of an edge if they spend too much time with friends and families, y'know.

<p>Hi everyone! I'm back from my week hiatus in Birmingham and ready to update! It's been a bit of a slow news week so I'll cover some smaller things that have 
happened recently:
<br>
<br><LI><b>Sonic Internet News</b> - Those of you wondering what was happening on the development of Sonic Robo Blast as far as fan games go, it seems Sonniku has vanished and A.J. Freda of <a href=www.segasonic.net>Segasonic.net</a> has taken over as programmer. Whether this is permanent we're not sure of, but we'll be sure to tell you as we find out more information.
<br>
<br><LI><b>Sonic Underground No More?</b> - According to Sonic fan Rlan - it seems Sonic Underground has been cancelled in Australia. Either it reached its 40 episode maximum or the TV program that hosted it, "Big Breakfast", has dropped it from thier line up. This makes the second country that has supposedly dropped Sonic Underground, with the first being the U.K. Bad quality in the program perhaps? Personally thats what I think...
<br>
<br><LI><b>Two New Midis</b> - Well known Sonic Music Composer, Jarel Jones has released two new Sonic Adventure midis! This time around, it's a remix of the Competition tune from Sonic 3.  
Realize that some of the chords are different, but Jarel did that on purpose.  Two versions were made, one GM and one XG.  But neither have XG effects.  Their
only difference is in musical intruments. The GM midi uses instruments that
sound better with Sound Blast 32/AWE cards (and Wingroove) while the XG
version sounds better on cards such as the Yamaha Soft Synthesizer (S-YXG100
is a good example). You can access the midis here:

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>David Bulmer has been taunting us fans on the Sonic mailing lists about a super project 
called "The Sonic Ideal". So just what is TSI? Probably the most long awaited of any Sonic fancomic, and after viewing some art of it for quite a while I must say it looks to definetely please. In fact - the time and care put into it is QUITE obvious.
Well the wait is over and TSI has finally been released! Dave let loose this "press release" on the mailing list today:

<p><center><A HREF="http://www.encarnacion.simplenet.com/sonicideal" target=_whole>
<IMG SRC="/eggmanadvert.jpg" ALT="The Sonic Ideal..."></A> 
</center>

<p><i>For over a year, European Sonic fans have been waiting for the release of the Sega Dreamcast. That day has finally arrived, and to celebrate, Ideal Creations would like to announce a brand new web comic - the comic that started to take shape just as the Dreamcast was becoming a reality, and is finally ready to be unveiled: THE SONIC IDEAL - THE NEO EMERALDS. 

<p>The continuing adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles Prower and Knuckles the Echidna, brought to you by a team of artists and writers from around the world, hand picked as the best Sonic artists on the Internet. It's free, it's for you, it's a celebration of what Sonic means to us. 

<p>Doctor Eggman was killed when his escape shuttle was blown out of the sky when he tried to steal the Master Emerald, a giant green stone of incredible powers. Four years later, Sonic and Miles remain friends, but nobody expected Doctor Eggman to ever show his face again... 

<p>BIGGER than any existing Sonic webcomic 

<p>BETTER artwork than ever 

<p>The Sonic Ideal is finally here, and all you have to do to see it is launch this website in your browser: <a href=www.encarnacion.simplenet.com/sonicideal>www.encarnacion.simplenet.com/sonicideal</a>

<p>We promised we'd do it, and we did. </i>

<p>Thanks to Dave - Sonic HQ is one of the few Sonic websites that has a special affiliation link to it. You can find it on our front page right under our Mushroom Kingdom link. You'll need Flash to view this website to its fullest. Take care - and we'll be reporting more info on TSI's launch as we get it. ^_^

<br>Steve Wilson, EB's console buying director said of the launch, "It was a fantastic start for Dreamcast. At store level, there was an incredible buzz in the build up to launch and, with the Dreamcast@Midnight <i>(an event that brought out some of Englands best known stars for the DC launch - WB note)</i>, we are expecting to attract a significant share of first day sales. As for the software chart - it's obvious Sonic hasn't lost his touch."

<p><i>I'm shutting down <b>Sonic Adventure: Total Neon</b>. Now before I get a hundred e-mails telling me to keep it up, just wait. Some of you may have heard I've been working on "Project Total Neon", and no that's not the site's real name, just a project name (I have already came up with the sites new name, I just don't want to tell the public yet). Anyway the site will have everything that this site has, but with tons of more stuff. I can't tell you what all of the new stuff is going to be but I will tell you this infomation. The new version of Casinopolis will have a HTML/Java Chao game that you can play. You go around the Casino finding Chao's then play with them. Casinopolis will also have new areas opened up, new games, and puzzles (like fighting a zombie or finding pieces of a map). The downloads section instead of being Sonic and Dreamcast stuff (which is what you can download here) it will be ALL Sega realted downloads! Also the site is going to have over 100 Sega wallpapers (and not that's not a typo; I will have over 100 wallpapers and 50-75 of them are Sonic realated) when the site opens!! When does the site open you ask? My goal is to open in on Halloween. BTW will not have our own domain (ie www.totalneon.com) but will much shotter then my URL now. So this means I will no longer be updating this site, expect to tell you the new address and if I open it later then expected.

<p>If you want to know the site's theme it's "Welcome to Your Dreams" because it will be a site that all Sonic fans have dreamed of.</i>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Having problems getting those nasty emblems in Sonic Adventure? Well popular website <A HREF=http://www.segadreamcast.net/>Sega X</a> just released a new trick in its mailbag for getting the pesky buggers:

<p><i>When playing as Sonic, stand at the base of any wall that has a slightly less than 90 degree bottom (even if it the bottom is not curved) Spin Dash ("X" button) at the wall like crazy and sonic will go up it really fast. A good place to learn and master this technique is in the first level, Emerald Coast. Right after the whale finishes chasing you, you will see a spikey gate, behind it really steep hill with bumpers, and off to the left, the base of a lighthouse. Run over to the left so that your back is towards the lighthouse and dash up the concave surface of the hill. Its really steep, so steer carefully, and hit "X" like mad. If done right sonic will dash all the way to the top and then probably go flying over the hill. You don't even need a running start. 
</i>

<p>A trick like this can save lots of time when going for an "A Emblem", and works in other levels, but does not work on walls that touch the ground at 90 degrees.

<b><font face="arial">Ken Penders On Bunnie's Handicap, Lupe's Death, And Choatix Continuity </font></b> - WB 12:00 am CST, 10-8-99</font></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Someone at Ken Penders messageboard seemed to be pretty ticked off at Ken Penders' decision in SSS 11 to have Bunnie never be able to see derobotization. Not to mention the fact that Lupe of the Wolf Pack is now dead in the grave. @.@ Ken Penders finally spoke out to hopefully put the subject matter to rest once and for all. 
The previous messenger text in cyan, angry messenger text is in yellow, Mr. Penders' text in red.

<p><font color=cyan> Actually, I wasn't surprised. Uncle Chuck said something about not being able to de-roboticize the Robians waaaay back in StH #...
scratches head, but fails to recall the exact issue #... thinks the story was called "The Rise & Fall of Robotropolis"
due to all the modifications--and even routine maintenance--done to 'em. After the "Mecha Madness" story arc, I figured this was a foregone conclusion w.r.t. Bunnie.
Still, to come right out and declare it like that...Well, I can see why some fans are not happy campers ;)
 </font>
<p><font color=yellow>Heck, YES, I'm "not a happy camper", and I don't see what there is to SMILE about with this, either! I was SO FREAKING _MAD_ when I read that!!!
 </font>
<p><font color=red>My take on Bunnie is simply this... when I was considering de-roboticizing her some time ago, I received e-mail from several handicapped readers all asking me to reconsider. (I used to do a lot of online chats for awhile back then.) When they explained to me that they looked upon Bunnie as a source of inspiration in dealing with a hardship, as well as a visible symbol to the non-happicapped that even those who have some deformity are capable of making a contribution, I felt they made a point that a lot of us tend to overlook. In having her deal with the fact she is half-'bot and accepting of her fate, it made her even more heroic than if she had been restored. I also think she would lose her uniqueness if she were restored. (It also makes Antoine that much more noble a character in accepting her as she currently is.) Bottom line: if Bunnie, Antoine and all their friends can accept her as she is, why can't anyone else? Or are those who aren't accepting simply displaying a latent prejudice because she isn't "perfectly normal"? Something to think about there.
 </font>
<p><font color=yellow>Oh, and by the way, the Lupe story? IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!! Not as far as I'M concerned. Clunky, super-fast, rushed writing like that when it comes to such an important character doesn't count when it comes to me. Either write her death better and longer and more set-up or I will NEVER believe it. Lupe is still alive. She was never roboticised. So HA!
 </font>
<p><font color=red>Sorry, but in OUR continuity, she is. You're perfectly free to write a non-roboticized Lupe story for your own enjoyment, but you will never see her or her family again in a deroboticized state. For one thing, we just don't have the room to deal with all the characters we have as it is.
Frankly, I thought the Lupe story was important simply because it showed that even a female could make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of those dear to her. More often than not, it's the girls who are usually shown being rescued instead of heroic, and that's why I felt that this was an opportunity to really make a statement with this character.
 </font>
<p><font color=yellow>Well, I, for one, have not READ the Mecha Madness Trilogy. I came into the comics REALLY REALLY LATE, you understand. When I first even HEARD of them, everybody was talking about the upcoming Knuckles #25. By the time I BOUGHT some, #25 was out already. Anyway, I have not READ the MechaMadness trilogy, I have not read "The Rise and Fall of Robotropolis", and as far as _I_ knew, there WAS always SOME hope for poor Bunnie. What about that future thing where you see her deroboticized?! Okay, so that's a POSSIBLE future. But, follow my logic here:
If it's IMPOSSIBLE for her to EVER be deroboticised, then the future vision, no matter WHICH one it was, of WHICH future, should NEVER have shown her as all-organic.
But since it DID show her that way...
...that means that there must BE a possibility!
 </font>
<p><font color=red>How do you know it's not her daughter, a clone, her twin sister, an alternate world version, or some other possibility I can't think of at the moment? Don't be so rigid in your thinking.
 </font>
<p><font color=yellow>But probably not. I think Ken just LIKES her being that way so he'll NEVER fix it. I shouldn't be expecting continuity from this comic anyway. To name just one glitch, the Chaotix adaptation showed clearly that all the different members of the team had just that minute met each other, and they were in a group. (Well, Charmy and Espio seemed to sorta know each other, but that was it.) However, later on, in I believe Knuckles #14, (I know it was one of that trilogy; coulda been #15) we have a scene set, we are led to believe, a couple years earlier or somewhere around there, where Mighty and Charmy meet each other for the first time--and it's a different setting and _no-one else is around_!
So....how DID they meet each other? By Mighty burrowing through a mountain to startle everybody to death, or by Charmy flying up to Mighty while he (the armadillo) was dipping his feet in a quiet wilderness stream?
According to the comics, BOTH happened.
But that can't be right. Not unless one or both characters suddenly got amnesia! I suppose you COULD "meet" someone for the "first" time TWICE if that happened!
Anyway, my point is, one the one hand, we were shown a POSSIBLE future where Bunnie was whole again, and if it's possible, that means that Dr. Quack's statement was WRONG. Maybe HE can't deroboticise her, but it's not beyond the laws of physics. If it wasn't possible, the future vision could not EVER have shown it. I mean, it was supposed to be a possible future, not an imaginary, totally-fake vision from out of someone's head. 
On the other hand, the incident I listed about with Charmy and Mighty shows that the comic has no continuity whatsoever. (And I'm still trying to figure out how a chameleon can live in the IceCap Zone and how infrared can see a crocodile, but never mind...)
So...I don't know WHICH interpretation is true.
 </font>
<p><font color=red>Regarding the KNUCKLES' CHAOTIX SPECIAL, of which I've been taking a bashing on this board over it lately, it seems. That was done simply because Sega wanted a tie-in to the 32X game. The big problem, though, was they only gave us some character designs from the game and not much else. We never received so much as a scrap of storyline beyond the fact the game supposedly took place at some amusement park. 

<p>When we wrote that story, my then-partner Mike was deteriorating from a long-term illness (from which he has since recovered from, thankfully). We had no clue at that time that anything we did with those characters would go beyond what eventually did take place, so we never planned for it. We simply took Sega's direction and worked from there. If I knew then what I know now, of course things would be different, but you have to judge in the context of when things were done.

<p>As for continuity, I try my hardest to maintain a tight ship, but I'm not infallible, so there's always a chance I'm going to forget something I did several months or years ago when I'm under a deadline pressure to finish the latest story. When I write, I'm more interested in telling a good story than I am in details that happened several issues ago. Most of the time there's no problem, but when there is, I know I'm going to hear about it one way or another.

<p>Is there a Dreamcast shortage on the horizon for Sega Dreamcast? According to <a href=http://www.segadreamcast.net>Sega X</a> maybe so...

<p>As God makes little green apples, so do hardware manufacturers warn of "shortages" when their consoles are birthed. The lastest announcement comes, unsurprisingly, from Sega of America. Vice President of Marketing, Peter Moore explained in a recent press release, "We are already in excess of what we expected to sell in the month of September. If we keep up at this stretch going into the busier months of October and into December, production will be challenged." 

<p>It is true that Dreamcast has been selling optimistically in North America since its September 9 launch. 514,000 consoles were sold, just two weeks after the debut. Mr. Moore continues, explaining that while Sega will be able to meet a demand which exceeds one million units, it will become increasingly more difficult as that figure inches toward two million. Current forecasts projects the company selling in excess of 1.8 million units, by the close of the Holiday shopping frenzy. 
Whether or not SOA can meet the overwhelming demand for its 128-bit box remains to be seen. We'll keep you updated if we find out anything...

<p>According to Next generation, MmWire today reports the results of a recent study by Fairfield Research. The study indicates that sales of Dreamcast titles are taking a significant chunk out of the N64 game market, but are having no effect on PlayStation game sales. Nintendo could not be reached for comment at press time. 
Retailers were surveyed as to which titles were selling best on all platforms, including Dreamcast. Running about equal in sales during the week of Sept. 20-24 were Sega's NFL 2K and Sonic Adventure and Namco's Soul Calibur. Retailers rated Midway's Ready 2 Rumble as having the best merchandising program.

Retailers also predicted the success of upcoming Dreamcast titles based on consumer and trade buzz. In order of their best-seller predictions, they cited: Sega's NBA2K, Majesco's Rainbow Six, Capcom's Resident Evil: Code Veronica and Marvel vs. Capcom, and the recently delayed Sega RPG Shenmue.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Lately some people have been wondering why the Knuckles comic will be ending on the King Of The Hill arc instead of the upswing Sonic Adventure adaption arc, now due to take place in STH #79 and upwards issues. Ken Penders recently had this to say concerning why its ending the way it is and other things:

<p><i>I haven't said much about this, because I have the attitude of letting the
stories speak for themselves.  However, in this case, I think a couple of
things need to be addressed.  First off, when the KING OF THE HILL storyline
was originally written, no one, least of all me, had a clue this would be the
book's final storyline.  Had we known, I would've done something different.
At the very least, even with the reduced frequency becoming imminent, we figured
we still had the SONIC ADVENTURE storyline to get through.  (And even then,
we still refused to take a completely negative attitude, hoping for some
positive development along the way.)  A second consideration why this story
was constructed so can be explained in the past four issues.  We didn't have
any physical action, and this was designed to make up for it.  I also wanted
this to be an easy transition for Steven Butler to get his feet wet as the
new KNUCKLES artist.  Unfortunately, he couldn't do it, so the art chores fell
into my lap, and I was grateful I had written the story as such, as it's been
a bear of a past few months trying to get through all the deadlines I had to
keep everything on track.</i>

<p>I still hate the fact that Archie couldn't wait until after SA to do this. But business is business I suppose.

<p>As if this cartoon wasn't weird enough...

<p>According to Rlan, a Sonic fan in Australia, this may possibly be a spoiler for those in America (if the episode hasn't aired yet) but supposedly Knuckles has returned to Sonic Underground in what seems to be a 2 or 3 part episode. 
Titled "New Echidna In Town", Doctor Robotnik supposedly has this giant Death Egg device that he's using to invade Mobius and is powered by a Chaos Emerald - however, thats not the crux of this news article. the thing is: DiC Animation has developed a "love thing"
between Knuckles and Sonia....So much so that they exchange kisses at the end of the episode.

<p>Pardon me while I barf....

<p>At any rate, look for Knuckles', Great Grandfather Athair (heavily redesigned by DiC) from the Archie comics to make an appearance as well. He's drawn completely different (glasses even) but has the same style and personality. This marks the appearance of another well known Sonic character (albeit a comics one) in the cartoons. It will be interesting to see what sad mutated rabbit DiC will pull out of its hat next. >;)

<p>Well this is.....interesting....

<p>Sega has kicked off its advertising campaign for Dreamcast in Europe.
For the launch of Dreamcast on October 14th 1999 a variety of ads will appear in lifestyle, trade and specialised press over the coming months. 
Needless to say there are some very strange articles >;)

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Remember the SA2 and spin-off rumor we posted? Recently the Sonic Adventure 2 speculations spread to news pages like wildfire.
As IGN.com said: "Never underestimate the ability of the press to embellish."
It seems a certain trade publication that originally ran the story may be practicing some bad journalism according to IGN...

<p><i>Recently, trade publication GameWEEK's Online counterpart, GameDAILY indicated that Sega Director of Marketing Communications Charles Bellfield indicated not only a sequel to Sonic Adventure, but also a spin-off title starring characters from the chart-topping Dreamcast platformer. 

<p>In following up on the story, IGNDC has learned that this isn't quite the case, so we decided to take time out to get you guys in the loop. According to Bellfield, "The comment that was made was that obviously, [Sonic] is a franchise that Sega plans return to, and that one could even expect titles featuring other popular from the seires characters in the future." The rest, apparently was the product of eager journalists attempting to stretch said comments for all they are worth. 

<p>Bellfield went on to say that while nothing concrete had been announced at present, that the comments were directed at questions regarding the future of the franchise which, of course, Sega has no intention of abandoning. Given that Naka-san himself confirmed that there were titles in development that have yet to be disclosed to the public, we'll be keeping our fingers crossed for the return of this franchise, among others, in the Sonic Team stable, and as always, we'll be sure to keep you posted when news does manage to reach the public.
</i>

<p>So this means that while Sonic Adventure 2 and the spinoff are not confirmed and just probable (thus negating that rumor, the Sonic 3 on DC report STILL IS. We'll keep you updated on any more as it happens.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Yes people, you read that title right - it looks like there are TWO NEW Sonic games in the works!

<p>Remember the Neo Geo Pocket "Sonic The Hedgehog" game we told you about a while ago, that is <b>probably</b> (my own guess) due in December or early 2000?
Well <a href=http://www.dcswirl.com>DC Swirl</a> (formerly known as Katana Edge) recently posted this news article on thier website:

<p><i>According to Game Daily, Charles Bellfield, director of marketing communications for Sega of America, confirmed today that not one but two new Sonic games are already in development. Despite Sonic Teams four titles being revealed already he confirmed that a true sequel to <i>Sonic Adventure</i> is already underway though no target date was announced. One can only wonder if Sega is trying the Crash Bandicoot route of yearly releases and hoping for release next Christmas. He also confirmed a more mysterious second spin-off title in the works starring one of the characters from Sonic Adventure. 
</i>

<p>Besides a Sonic Adventure sequel, what the other "Sonic game", let alone what character it will focus on (PRAY that its Knuckles and the Chaotix) is still remains a mystery. So combining these two new announcements with the Neo Geo Handheld makes THREE Sonic games in the works! Sonic fans, It looks like the second Sonic Explosion has begun... ^_^

<p><b>Source #1:</b> <a href=http://www.dcswirl.com/>DC Swirl</a>

<p>Now for exclusive #2! 

<p>Disappointed over the Shenmue delay? Still angry over Sega Rally 2 not being playable online? Hopefully, this piece of news will do something to cheer you up. Listen to what <a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com/>IGN</a> had to say concerning <b>Sonic The Hedgehog 3</b> on Dreamcast!!!:

<p><i>According to a very reliable source of ours in Japan, Sonic Team has begun development on Sonic The Hedgehog 3 for the Dreamcast! As our source told us, "basically Sonic 3 on Dreamcast will be an enhanced version, similar to Sonic Adventure, with a lot more". 
At the moment, it's not yet clear whether Sonic 3 will remain a 2d title, or if Yuji Naka has plans to drag the game into the third dimension. From what our source told us, we get the feeling Sonic Team is opting for the latter. 
While the news of Sonic Adventure 2 would have perhaps been better, we're certainly not complaining about Sonic 3 on Dreamcast! Sega has yet to make an official announcement on the matter, but we're expecting some solid details on this some time next week.
</i>

<p>Keep in mind that THIS second bit of news is a rumor as opposed to the above one which seems to have come from a Sega Marketing Executive. At any rate - keep a sharp eye out here as we'll be posting more on this as we find it! Later guys!

Sega will have a 2900 square foot exhibit at the expo, featuring over 34 interactive stations, including playable game kiosks and a presentation of <i>Shenmue</i>.

As suggested by today's press release, online gaming technology could be introduced through the exhibit before being released to the public 
<p>Peter Moore, Senior Vice President (and recent company spokseman) at Sega of America was more enthusiastic than ever over the deal. ``Innoventions is an ideal forum for us to demonstrate Dreamcast's ability to make the world a smaller, more enjoyable place by connecting people via the Internet for the first time through a low cost gaming console, "said Moore. "Sega Dreamcast's 56K modem and realistic, evolving gameplay represent the future of gaming and technology. We look forward to continually updating our Innoventions exhibit as new technology and Sega Dreamcast games are introduced."

<p><i>I've just been informed by the webmaster of Videogamers.com that he will no longer be doing web hosting. I'm not sure when the account will be cut, but freak not...I have a backup plan. I can't go into detail about it, as I've been asked to keep mum regarding the project. It's a pretty good deal, but the bad news is that it won't be ready until November at the soonest. Which means that, for the period of a month or so, the GHZ will be non-existent. Freak not once again, the <a href=http://www.paradise-web.com/plus_le/plus.mirage?who=greengibbon>message board</a> is on a different server, so bookmark it and keep checking back there for progress reports. 

<p>This is probably a good thing for me, as I'm working on so many things right now maintaining the site is just slowing me down. Let me emphasize, though, that I'm not about to let the GHZ die...I've devoted far too much time and care into this site to let it go now. We'll just be going into hibernation for a bit...GHZ veterans are used to this, and we're long overdue for a freeze-over. Once again, bookmark the message board and drop in every once in a while to keep up-to-date on the GHZ's status, or just <a href=mailto:ggibbon@dragonslave.com>E-mail me</a>  if you've got any questions or anything. Thanks everyone, I'll see you guys in November and it's gonna be a beautiful thing! Ja!

<p>Our Sonic Adventure archive may not be done yet, but get a load of all these new codes IGN and Game Sages just recently linked to for Sonic Adventure! Those of you who are looking for new stuff to try should check this out!

<p><b>***NOTE***</b> - Those of you that have asked about the "Play as Metal Sonic, or Play as chaos 0, or Play as Doctor Robotnik" stuff - THESE CODES DO NOT EXIST AND ARE PHONY! There - I've said it. On with the codes:

<p><b>1. Cloning Knuckles</b>
<br>Play through the game (with all the characters) until you get Super Sonic. In Super Sonics Adventure, go to the crashed island. There you see Knuckles and Doc Eggman (Robotnik). After the clip, press A+B+X+Y+Start. Then choose Knuckles. Go to the same place, and there are two Knuckles! This works with other characters, too, but it's not as weird as the Knux one is.
<br>submitted by Dark Vegetto

<p><b>2. Aztec Forest Shortcut</b>
<br>To get to the Frog and the Emerald as Tails in one step do as fallows. After riding the trolly to the Aztec Forest you should be standing up high on a platform overlooking the forest. If you stand on the edge and look down and to the left you will see two trees sticking out of the canopy that are close together. Fly toward the trees and land next to the one that is closest to the ledge you jumped from. You should be standing on top of the canopy. Walk around the first tree until you fall through the canopy and end up right by the emerald and the frog.
<br>submitted by tray@uswest.net

<p><b>3. Better Living Through Chao</b>
<br>Instead of throwing a Chao against a wall to hatch it, try just rubbing the egg like you were rubbing the Chao. Then set it down and back away. It will start jumping, and then it will hatch. They seem to like you better if you do this.
<br>submitted by sonic_tails

<p><b>4. Black Morphing Chao</b>
<br>First you have to be the E-102 Gamma. To get a black chao go into the Egg Carrier and go to the bridge. On the bridge you see three doors. Go in the one with the prison. Open the middle cell by jumping on the peg and take the egg back to the bridge. On the bridge go behind the chair Robotnik sits on, behind it is a door with 6 buttons in front of it, stomp on them in an order that spells E-G-G-M-A-N and the door will open. While still holding the egg step into the teleporter in the room, then you'll be in the egg catcher chao garden, now just hatch the egg

<p><b>5. Change View in Twinkle Circuit</b>
<br>To change the view in Twinkle Circuit Race, press UP to toggle between inside, outside, and far out view. This also works when playing the first bumper car portion of the level.
<br>submitted by Omar Sharar

<p><b>6. Clean Pause</b>
<br>To remove the pause menu, press X and Y together at the pause menu. This is good if you want to take screenshots.
<br>submitted by Segaholic2

<p><b>7. Drive with Anyone in Twinkle Circuit.</b>
<br>After completing the game with all six characters, you will be able to race in Twinkle Circuit with anyone. Just select the character you want, then go to station square. Once your there, go over to the little patch of grass and weeds by speed highway entrance, and pick up the ticket. (It will be rotating, and easy to spot.) Then go into the Twinkle Park building, and instead of entering Twinkle Park, enter Twinkle Circuit. You will hear a special noise that tells you that the secret is unlocked. Now just repeat the process for all the characters.
Best racers are as follows: 
<br>
<br>Knuckles 
<br>Sonic 
<br>Tails 
<br>E-102 
<br>Big 
<br>Amy 
<br>
<br>submitted by Eggman

<p><b>8. Easy Emblems as Knuckles</b>
<br>If you are having trouble getting the 1 minute emlems as Knuckles, here is a trick that will make it much easier. Find the first emerald shard, but don't touch it! Instead, pause the game and restart the level. Now run to it as fast as you can. Since the shards act as save-points, find the next one and repeat. Do this until you have all three.
<br>submitted by Segaholic2

<p><b>9. Free Rings</b>
<br>As Tails, go to any place with grass and look for a dark green weed. Wack it with your tail. If you are lucky, a ring or extra life will appear.
While playing with Knuckles and have the Silver knuckle gloves, goto a place where you can dig and in most places (especially places with plants) you can uncover up to 20 rings.
<br>submitted by Mike Mehuys aka Rebeltropr (Rebeltropr@aol.com)

<p><b>10. The Golden Chao Baby</b>
<br>There are two open shops in the part of Station Square with the open manhole. The golden chao's egg is in one of them. Unfortunately every time you lift the egg from its pressure sensitive platform, the doors are barred shut. Go to the city hall area where you fought Chaos 0 and look near the walls and grass. An egg-shaped rock is here, and you can put it on the platform in the store. You may now leave freely with the golden chao egg.
<br>submitted by Vector

<p><b>11. Sonic The Chao!</b>
<br>If you give a chao about 20 of the pink animals (rabbits, kangaroos, deer) it will start to look like everyone's favorite hedge hog. 
<br>submitted by Kevin Reopelle

<p><b>12. Metallic Chao</b>
<br>To get the one-of-a-kind metallic chao baby, go to the waterfall near the subway and look to the right of it. You will see a sort of platform. Go to it and push it. A metallic egg will fall down the waterfall and into the pond. When it reaches the land pick t up and bring it to the nearest Chao sanctuary. Throw it and it will hatch.
<br>submitted by AlexG

<p><b>13. One-and-a-Half Play</b>
<br>When you are playing Sonic's action stages and Tails is on the screen, a second player can control Tails with a second controller. Any rings Tails collects will be added to Sonic's totals. Be careful to not make Tails break open any shields, invincibilities or One Up item boxes as those will not be added to Sonic and will be wasted.
This feature may seem trivial to most people, but you'd be surprised how much fun it can be trying to outrun player one (who's playing Sonic) when you're controlling Tails. ;)
<br>submitted by Chris Koeler

<p><b>14. PC Wallpaper</b>
<br>If you insert your Sonic Adventure game disc into a PC CDROM drive, you will have access to a directory called "extras". Inside you'll find a number of Sonic Adventure desktop wallpapers you can decorate your PC's desktop with.
<br>submitted by Chris Kohler

<p><b>15. Secret Chao Puzzle Game</b>
<br>After you start up the Sonic Adventure game, place a controller into the D port on your Dreamcast and have a VMS in the controller. A hidden Chao Puzzle game will appear on the VMS screen. It is a tile based puzzle game where you have to use the Dreamcast's controller to move the pieces of a moving picture around to win. After every five puzzles you solve, a little animation will play on the VMS screen.
<br>submitted by Chris Koeler

<p><b>16. Sonic's Snowboard Select</b>
<br>Just before entering the snowboarding part of the ice stage, press X to get Sonic's blue snowboard (previously seen in Sonic 3 and Sonic Triple Trouble). Press B to get Sonic's yellow board (only seen in Sonic Adventure.)

figures, plush toys, electronic plush toys, remote control figures and
vehicles, paper and stationery products, spring and summer toys as well as
junior sporting goods. Product is currently expected to be available for
shipment at various ''roll-out`` dates throughout the year 2000.

<p>Steve Altro, Chairman of Grand Toys commented, ``We are excited to add Sonic
The Hedgehog to our diverse portfolio of licensed products. The excitement
surrounding the recent launch of the Sega Dreamcast system should only add to
the appeal of characters like Sonic, which we believe can transcend the video
game market into popular toys. The addition of Sonic further demonstrates our
commitment to pursue strong and exciting new product distribution licenses,
from sources all over the world.''

<p>Ladies and gents - we've got a new poll up for you to vote on. But first, the results of our last two:

<p><i>Will you continue to buy Sonic comics after the Knuckles cancellation announcement? 

<p><font color=red>Yes - 124 Votes: 62%</font>
<br><font color=cyan>No - 12 Votes: 6%</font>
<br><font color=green>I Might - 13 Votes: 7%</font>

<br><font color=magenta>They Make Sonic Comics? - 23 Votes: 12%</i></font>

<p><b>Total Votes: 200</b> - Honestly I was suprised at the large contrast of yes votes to no votes considering the big hoopla that cancellation notice brought up. But at least some people still have SOME faith in the comics no matter what will be.
And as for you "They Make Sonic Comics" people - what? have you been hiding under a rock? ^_^

<p>Now for the other poll - The Playstation 2 VS DC:

<p><i><font color=red>DC Stays Strong - 138 votes: 73%</font>

<p>Now for our next two polls that tantalize both genre's of sonic fans - We've passed the landmark 75th issue: What do you think so far of Karl Bollers' stint as new writer for the Sonic Comics?

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Year after year after year after year people that don't like the Sonic comics ask the question "Why not just throw the entire current Archie Sonic continuity out and start anew with Sonic Adventure, or base it off the games or something? Why not just start over?"
Well, today someone posted about this on Ken Penders' messageboard and he finally spoke out as to what goes on about dealings with Sega on the comic adaptions, story structure, and other things...

<p><b><font color=red>Posted By <a href="mailto:Missjedi20@aol.com">Amy Rose</a></b>

<p>Ok, I'll probably get flamed for this, but in my opinion, most of the characters in the sonic the hedgehog comic are just plain annoying, and the plot is, well..kind of pathetic. What i think they should do is throw the whole thing out, and start over fresh from the beginning. They should forget about the freedom fighters, and base the comic on Sonic adventure in my opinion. Ive noticed that the personality of Sonic in Sonic adventure is much better than his personality in Archie. And Dr. Eggman is different too. In the archie version he looks like a giant lord of evil, and in SA, well, hes evil of course, but not like the Archie version. I like the SA eggman better. They will probably never do this, but i wish they would throw the whole plot they have going out and base it on Sonic Adventure, and just build an entirly new series. 
</font>

<p>People that don't like the comic have asked and wondered that time and time again. This is Ken Penders' response which is rather interesting...

<p><b><font color=yellow>Posted By Ken Penders</a></b>

<p>We've known for over a year what was going to be in Sonic Adventure, at least in regards to the Japanese version. The graphics alone had everyone at Archie excited about incorporating the Sonic Adventure characters and plots into our series. However, we ran into a big obstacle, and that was Sega itself. They wanted us to do a game adaptation, but they didn't cooperate with us in the slightest. We had to go out and find someone to translate the Japanese version because no one at Sega saw fit to share anything with us. The video I had was made by Spaz, who recorded his gameplay. 
I understand why many people would want us to start over after seeing Sonic Adventure, but that wouldn't be fair to the large number of fans who already love the current cast of characters. Besides, as you'll see, our version and the Sonic Adventure are really not that incompatible. In fact, Justin was amazed how easily I incorporated the ongoing storyline in Knuckles with the game adaptation itself. 
What i find interesting is the debate whether Sonic is getting too anime in style versus whether he is anime enough. </font>

<p>What do you think? We'd like to know. Listed below is the link to Ken Penders' messageboard, if you wish post your opinions there and on Sonic HQ's  "Mobius Forum" as well.
It could make for an interesting topic...

<p>The NPD group, the company responsible for those TRST reports you keep hearing about, has released U.S. software sales figures for the period of September 5th to September 11th. 
The Dreamcast, despite being released on September 9th, midway into the tracking period, was well represented on the list, with seven titles appearing in the top twenty.
The national list of Top Five Games Is As Follows:

<p>1. Final Fantasy 8 (Square)
<br><b>2. Sonic Adventure</b>
<br>3. Soul Calibur
<br>4. NFL2K
<br>5. Ready To Rumble

<p>In addition to these figures, the NPD has also provided some interesting information for the entire week from September 5th to the 11th. Sales for the video game market, including hardware, software, and accessories, were up a full 133% from the previous week, with the Dreamcast responsible for 88% of the growth. 546,000 consoles were sold during the week, as opposed to 223,000 from the week before (before the DC's release). Finally, the DC captured 60% of the next-generation console business during its first week of business, although Nintendo 64 and PlayStation weren't affected too much, both combining for only an 8% dropoff in sales.

<p><b>SEGA DREAMCAST TOPS HALF MILLION MARK IN UNITS SOLD, 
BESTS RECORDS SET BY SONY, NINTENDO, APPLE AND DVD</b>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 23, 1999) -- Sales of Sega(R) of America, Inc.'s 128-bit, Internet-ready Sega Dreamcast(TM) videogame system continue at a blistering pace. The company announced today at the Intelliquest Brand Tech Forum in San Francisco that in just two weeks, Sega Dreamcast has topped the half million units sold mark. The advanced videogame console has sold through a total of 514,000 units since it launched on 9.9.99. In contrast, Sony PlayStation(TM) reached the half million mark in four months in 1995 and NintendoÒ 64 reached the same number after two months at retail when it launched in 1996, according to the NPD Group of Port Washington, NY. 

<p>Sega Dreamcast's record-breaking launch also beat sales milestones set by other high-profile consumer products. The much-touted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iMac personal computer took six weeks to sell 278,000 units. And, DVD in its first year only sold 430,000 units.

<p>Today's announced sales figures for Sega Dreamcast well surpass the company's previous projections of hitting 400,000 in the system's first month of availability at retail. Since its introduction, Sega Dreamcast has been a sales leader, capturing more than 60% of all new console sales, according to NPD. In addition to hardware, software for Sega Dreamcast is also selling at a brisk pace. NPD research shows that four of the top five games for the week ending September 11 were Sega Dreamcast titles, including Sega's "Sonic Adventure(TM)," Sega Sports' "NFL 2K(TM)," Namco's "Soul Calibur(TM)" and Midway's "Ready 2 Rumble Boxing(TM)."Consumer demand for Sega Dreamcast is continuing at a record pace," said Chris Gilbert, senior vice president of sales, Sega of America, Inc. "All of our retailers are reporting huge sales for the system and we are working very closely with them to meet the massive demand we are anticipating for the holiday season."

<p>Sega Dreamcast's 128-bit architecture makes it the first console with evolutionary capabilities, allowing it to grow and change to match advances in technology and the needs and desires of the consumer. Sega Dreamcast is also the most powerful video game console ever created and the first to offer Internet connectivity including e-mail, browsing and chat using the Sega Dreamcast Network. It is 15 times more powerful than a Sony PlayStation, ten times more powerful than a Nintendo 64 and has four times the graphics processing power of the fastest Pentium II processor. In addition, Sega Dreamcast is the first console to utilize hand-held gaming through its Visual Memory Unit (VMU), which allows players to swap games with friends in the home, arcade or head-to-head using two VMUs.

<p>Congrats Sega America on a job well done! ^_^

themselves in an ancient city that is a brave new world to them. Filled with five-fingered 
Overlanders who call themselves "humans," the furry friends are given a warm welcome 
a la "Escape From The Planet Of The Apes" - the heroes receive a tour of the city, Amy 
goes shopping, Tails flies his plane, etc. But all is not right here, and true to form, Sonic's 
restless spirit finds him on night patrol, where his curiosity inevitably leads him to 
trouble and feats of daring do! The action continues in Sonic Super Special #12, shipping 
January 2000!

<p>A special issue inspired by the popular new Sonic Adventure game for the hot Sega

Robotnik and his horrid horde of Shadowbots descend upon the Floating Island! It's all 
part of Robotnik's quest to find "Perfect Chaos" - a hibernating dragon-like monster 
made of living water! In order to revive it, Robotnik needs a major power source - and 
he's got his evil eyes set on the Floating Island's "Master Emerald" - even if he winds up 
destroying a portion of the Chaos Chamber and its surrounding land mass to get it! As if 
things couldn't get any worse, Mammoth Mogul escapes in all the mayhem, and the Cat 
People aren't too happy about that land mass that's suddenly entered their coast!

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Over the past few days, there have been plenty of stories regarding Sega's Dreamcast network plans. Mostly, the news has been bad, with reports that Sega had delayed online gaming until the third quarter of the year 2000. We found this to be just about the worst news imaginable, and we cried and cried until our faces were blue. Then, we called Sega and got the official word on the state of online play for the Dreamcast. The story is slightly different from what's been reported.

<p>First off, Sega's official word since August has been "online gaming will be introduced over the next twelve months." So, basically, we've known since August that online gaming would be available on the DC no later than August of next year. In our conversation today, Sega added to this statement, saying "Online gaming will be active before Q3 2000." Q3 2000 begins in July, so it seems that we may actually see online games by mid year of 2000 (which, in case you're unfamiliar with the modern calendar, is before August). Finally, Sega made another comment: "The only news that was announced in Tokyo was that we would have roughly 12 online games by Q3 2000. Such games as Half Life will be included in this list."

<p>The picture doesn't look nearly as bleak with these new statements by Sega. Not only does it look like the DC will have 12 online games by mid year (assuming that Sega lives up to its statements), but the possibility still exists for actual online gaming to be introduced earlier in the year (we're going to assume that Sega won't be throwing out twelve online games on the same day). Of course, the question of how long we'll have to wait for true online gaming still remains, but Sega's statements point to the fact that we won't be waiting for as long as we originally thought.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>For those that don't know, we just began our cartoons page yesterday. But in my haste to get the page up after seeing Mr. Hursts comments on AFSH I forgot to actually put them on the news page! >;)
Ben Hurst was the premier writer for Sonic SatAM - this is what he had to say concerning SU:

<p><i>To tell you the truth, I'm not positive who did the development on SU - I was sort of swept into it on the fly. I'm not familiar with the "Sheriff" moniker, but with my memory, that's not surprising. :) In SatAm, I didn't think of Robotnik as anything but just that, Robotnik - and tried my best not to add to the title. Single names have such a great wicked feeling and I think "Doctor" dilutes that. Just my opinion. 

<p>Pat and I didn't start as story editors. We wrote the leadout episode and someone upstairs decided we had a good handle on the characters and decided to oust the story editor and replace him with us. Then, instead of having the time to plot the arc of the series, we had to hit the ground running. On top of that, a fair number of the episodes were given over to another story editing team. These guys were good, but the continuity of the series suffered, since they had a different "take" on the overall series. As you know from SatAm, I tend to take these stories seriously. I try to build an emotional arc, creating great tension and action - and bring out the humor in both the situations and the characters. I succeeded in doing this in a more than a few of the SU episodes, but the pace (two scripts a week) forced many compromises and that's why I said that we fell short of the mark. Fortunately, many of the episodes were still pretty good, but for the reasons mentioned above, the consistency and the overall "feel" of the series is not as developed as SatAm. </i>

<p>Thats interesting to know. SU has gotten SERIOUSLY mixed reviews from Sonic fans saying that they either hate it, a few love it, or others just cant find it at all on television (myself included).

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size=-1 face="arial">

<p>Today we found out from checking his page, that JD Harding has finally decided to close the doors on the Sonic Corner, one of the webs largest Sonic music sites on the net. Here's what he had to say:

<p><i>The Sonic Corner has closed down. Let me explain why. I've been working on this site for two years now. I've done a fairly good job keeping this place looking great, and up till now it's gotten a fairly large ammount of visitors, and I have no complaints about the site. The problem lies with me wanting to move on. I've lost interest in Sonic the Hedgehog. The games are still great, but my interest when I first started this site, and my interest now are two totally different things. My interest before was a desire, a want to make the greatest Sonic the Hedgehog site online. My wants and wishes now are more concerned with my life outside of this site. 

 
<p>I've gotten a new job going now. I'm currently a Website designer. I would like to devote all of my time into work, and less time with this site. The rest of my time is devoted to my friends, and my music. What little time I have left is for myself, which leaves zero time for me to fiddle with TSC. I'm sorry about this. I know you all love this site, and come back regularly, and I'm grateful for your loyalty to TSC. You still can come and visit TSC. I'll keep the site up for a couple more years. I just don't have the time to update it. 

 
<p>I want to thank all of the people who have made TSC a great site. The composers, artists, writers, the people who visited my message boards, and even just the people who came here to listen to a few Sonic MIDIs, and then left. It's great to have you all here, and even though this site won't be updated anymore, I hope you all keep coming back. 

 
<p>Anyway, have fun with TSC. This is JD, signing off for the last time. Ciao! ^.^ </i>


<p>Sonic HQ would like to wish JD good luck and happiness in his endeavors. If you'd like to check out his page, check our source link below.

<p>After mutilating the record set by Star Wars, The Phantom Menace, Sega today released the final tally of its record launch. The bottom line for the first four days - over $132 million in sales and 372,000 Dreamcast units sold. This was more than the N64's 350,000 units sold over its first six days. Sega said it sold an average of three games per unit, a very solid number. 
Several retialers reported very strong numbers. For example, Electronics Boutique and Babbages beat their previous sales records, and Toys R Us sold out its Dreamcast units by Friday. 

<p>"There is simply no comparison to the launch of Sega Dreamcast," said Daniel DeMatteo, president, Babbage's, Etc. "This launch easily surpassed our expectations and we expect consumer demand to get even stronger as we head into the important holiday shopping months." 

Joseph J. Firestone, President and CEO of EB, commented, "Traditionally, our strongest day of the year coincides with the Christmas holiday. To have sales of this magnitude in September is truly an event. Many of our stores opened at midnight on the 9th and experienced heavy traffic flow. Our Sunset Galleria store in Las Vegas pre-sold more than 700 units, making it our top performing store on the initial release day."

<p>Someone brought up a REALLY good point - with Knuckles now being cancelled, where does this leave everyone's favorite Chaotix (not to mention the long lost Charmy Bee) other than comic book limbo? Ken Penders had this to say:

<p><i>Espio still will have his 3-parter in KNUCKLES #30 through 32, and I'm hoping to work in a All-Chaotix SONIC SUPE SPECIAL down the road, very similar in format to the all-female special coming out soon. All I ask is for everyone to have patience. Thanks. </i>

<p>So thats all we have to go on. At least an integral part of the Knuckles book isn't lost - namely the Chaotix, but this DOES severely limit thier appearances to a nub. At least it will be a full Super Special which we can look forward to. And at least those aren't in any danger at all.

<p>Sorry for the no-updates yesterday gang. Its really late as I type this so bear with me. The Emu Zone servers were down so we could not access any of the site material, which explains why news wasn't updated. At any rate Andy Wolan has graciously fixed the problem so I'd like to use this space to adress some site news now that we 
are slowly getting back on track with things, before I hit you all with the barrage of regular news below. ^_^

<p><LI>The Cartoons Page - Our most asked about page: Scheduled to go up on YESTERDAY, server problems hindered this. All that is left is for all 26 RM files to upload to the Emuzone servers. Expect the full release date of our new cartoons page with Anime, Sonic Underground, SatAM, SatAM cartoon downloads, and just about EVERYTHING Sonic cartoon related that we can get our hands on this Wednesday night GUARANTEED.
And if its not up on Wednesday send all personal flames <a href=mailto:neoblackbat@hotmail.com>here</a>! No jive! >;)

<p><LI>Expect some new stuff to be added soon to our overall staff page as well as a "Sonic HQ Mission Statement". Basically the staffers, Vector and I will be preparing a statement about what we're about, what we plan to do, why we created this page was created for the Sonic fanbase and just what you can expect from us in the future. Basically, what our "vision" is all about. Consider it a way of us getting more personal with you.

<p><LI>No we're not hiring right now, but who knows what may come in the future. Those of you that have sent in ideas, requests, and whatnot rest assured that I have read your letters Vector and I will be getting back to each and every one of you soon. But I'm already telling you right now - we're not looking to hire just yet >;)

<p><LI>After this Friday if things go smoothly, the main Sonic HQ staff email will be re-routed to sonichq@emulationzone.org. For those of you that have our old sonichq@yahoo.com address saved - delete it. We will no longer be using it after this Friday. >;)

<p><LI>Thanks to those people that have sent in kind words of encouragement. Its really meant a lot to me be you a staffer or a regular joe that visits here. We check our guestbooks and email periodically so if we don't respond just remember that we're busy and have real lives outside of Sonic too, but we DO try to read everything you say. So keep on sending in those compliments and complaints.

<p><LI> And lastly Brian has returned from his two week trip to Disney World. So the Q&A page will be reopening soon. Once cartoons is launched Samanfur and Zachary begin work on the Fleetway page, while Vector and I will be hard at work bringing you the MUCH NEEDED Sonic Games List Revamp AND....THE SONIC ADVENTURE WALKTHROUGH. yes you heard it right. I plan on helping to compile a thorough SA walkthrough from Chao to Chaos to Super Sonic himself! >;) 

<p>All in all we have A LOT of things planned for you guys and this is just the beginning! Stick with us - the best is yet to come!

It will supposedly be an online version based on a revitalization of the old Genesis Phantasy Star RPG series. Hmm...that would mean Dreamcast would be the first system with a sci-fi based RPG, in fact with TWO sci-fi RPGs with Turbine Entertainment (the guys behind the up and coming Asheron's Call) creating one with SoA.

Stories I HAD PLANNED for FUTURE KNUCKLES KNUCKLES ISSUES WILL BE APPEARING in an altered form in the back of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG BEGINNING WITH ISSUE #86.

<p>Acting like Chicken Little does no one any good. 
<p>This is not Orwellian speak coming from me. I stated the facts plain and clear, so let's not distort them any further, okay?</i>
</font>

<p>Well thats reassuring <u>somewhat</u>. It means that while Karl Bollers will still be doing the front, Ken Penders will have complete control over the back, doing the previously planned Knuckles material. It will be interesting to see how this will affect the Sonic series as a whole after issue 86....Its still not reassuring concidering the Knuckles book has been cancelled since its been a favorite since it came out,
but at least the subscription bit is cleared up. We'll post more on this information as we find out. Remember - if you have any questions post them to Ken Penders MB linked below.

<font size=-1 face="arial">
<p>As of Knuckles #32 - The comic book <b>Knuckles The Echidna</b> has officially been cancelled.

<p>Coming straight from Mr. Penders, this is what he had to say on the subject of the cancellation, the Sonic Adventure crossover, and the future of the Sonic Super Specials.

<p><i>Sadly, the KNUCKLES series will end for now as of issue #32. The good news is that he isn't going away. The material developed for issues #33 through #35 as part of the SONIC ADVENTURE game adaptation will be appearing in the pages of SONIC starting with issue #79 of that series. The story scheduled for KNUCKLES #36 will now appear in SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #14, which then leads into the KNUCKLES 8-page back-up series that begins in SONIC #86. It'll be a regular feature for the forseeable future, unless sales of the last few issues show enough of an upward climb to encourage Archie to restore Knuckles to his own series once again. 
<p>At this point, KNUCKLES: TWENTY YEARS LATER will appear in SONIC SUPER SPECIAL #16. If there is further news, please refer to this website, as i will keep everyone updated with the latest developments. 
</i>

<p>So what does this mean? It means that ONCE AGAIN we're gonna have backup stories in the Sonic book in the near future >:| How this will affect the coherency of the SA crossover is another thing but lets not get into now.
It seems that the specials aren't in any danger, but at the same time we're back at square one.

<p>So what does this mean for those that have renewed thier subscriptions for the book? Well, we're not really sure yet. Someone asked Mr. Penders as this newsbyte was just released but he hasn't responded yet. If you have any questions we suggest that you post them on Mr. Penders board located below.

<b><font face="arial">Mystery Of The Defective Dreamcasts Solved</font></b> - WB 4:30 pm CST, 9-10-99</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
<font size=-1 face="arial">
<p>As announced by Tristan, one of HQ's news reporters, the mystery of the defective dreamcasts popping up all over the country has finally been figured out and is NOT located only in California as I so wrongly pointed out yesterday.
Here is <a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com>IGN.com</a> with the full story and what to do should you have a defective DC, web browser, and/or game:
<p><i>Among the thousands of insanely pleased e-mails from new Dreamcast owners across the country, we've also seen a trickle of reports that indicate all is not well in launch land. Reports of everything from consoles overheating to titles refusing to boot at all have made their way to various sites across the web, so we decided to dig a little deeper into the situation and give you guys the full story.<P>
<p>Charles Bellfield, Director of Marketing Communications for Sega of America, was kind enough to give us a call and fill us in, and while he admits the DC launch has hit a few snags, the problem is not what many are making it out to be, and has also provided multiple solutions for replacing faulty materials.<P>
<p>The problem apparently stems from a faulty software run, which has been isolated to product shipped from a single distribution house. Several first-run titles, including small numbers of <I>Sonic Adventure</I>, <I>Blue Stinger</I>, Ready 2 Rumble</I>, <I>Hydro Thunder</I>, <i>and in particular, the Dreamcast Web Browser, have had issues booting up, but Sega insists it's <B>not</b> a hardware issue. <P>
<p>Additionally, Sega is on top of the problem, offering numerous solutions to DC owners.  Said Bellfield, "As part of our commitment to our consumers. Any software that does not boot, will be replaced at the retailer where the title was purchased."<P>
<p>As for the web browser, Sega has several outlets to replace faulty disks, including:<P>
<LI>E-mail support@sega.com, with the subject line "DC web browser," including in the mail body your name, address and phone number, and Sega will send a new one out by Monday or Tuesday. <P>
<LI> Or, call 1-800-USA-Sega. An operator can then take your information and send out a disk directly.<P>
<LI>There will also be an additional toll-free number sent out to help deal with the volume of calls.  Sega will be releasing the number shortly.<P>
<LI>Lastly, consumers can go to Sega.com and fill out a customer support form in the Help section.<P>
<p>Sega was quick to emphasize that the problem is software related, and that gamers should not return hardware units without first investigating the known software issues associated with the Midnight Madness shipment. We'll keep you posted should any more information surface.<P></i>
<p>Hope this helps anyone that was having problems.

<font size=-1 face="arial">
<p>Ken Penders, premier Archie <b>Knuckles The Echidna</b> writer, had this to say concerning the letters page on the comics of <b>Knuckles</b> and <b>Sonic Super Special</b>:
<p><i>I may be foolish for doing this, but I am going to be handling the letters pages for every issue of KNUCKLES and SONIC SUPER SPECIAL from now on.  
<p>That means if you send your thoughts, comments and questions to me via either posting it on this board </i>(link located below)<i> or e-mailing directly to me at <a href = mailto:kenpenders@aol.com>KenPenders@aol.com</a>, I'll select the best ones and include them on the page. 
<p>As of now, I'm putting together the column for KNUCKLES #31, which will feature comments concerning KNUCKLES #27. I need to have it completed by Saturday, so you have until noon Saturday, September 11, to submit your comments.
<p>If more than one ask the same question(s), I may batch them together so more people get mentioned, so please also list your city, state and age to make my job easier. Thanks.
</i><p>So Ken controls the letter pages now. 
The link to Mr. Penders board is located below if you wish to make input on the comics for letters page from now on. This probably wont make Archie Comics email addy obselete, but this is probably a better way of trying to get your letter in the comic as this is the writer himself doing it.

<p>Tomorrow is the big day for all you lucky Americans-- unless you've been living under a rock for five years, you should know that 9/9/99 (tomorrow) is the day of the American release of the Sega Dreamcast and Sonic Adventure!
<p>Unfortunately it's not all that simple for those of us who live in Europe. Here DC and SA don't get released until 14th of October-- that's over a month away! However, there is already media building up on the DC launch. For example, there are various new DC mags, such as the official one (the preview issue of which is almost identical to the US version, only not quite as many features), with a special DC preview video; and others such as DC-UK and DC Monthly. All that is said about SA is that it's coming our way! ^_^
<p>Also, there was recently a special DC launch in London this last weekend, to which many big stars (don't ask me who; I haven't a clue) turned up to try it out. The main attraction of the DC is, apparently, its internet capiabilities, rather than its amazing 128-bit specifications! ^_^

<p>Word has been sweeping around trade show floors in both England and Germany that Sega could delay Dreamcast in Europe again.
<p>At a recent trade show in Berlin, Germany, industry scuttlebutt towards a second delay for Dreamcast in Europe began to surface. On August 27, the company announced that Dreamcast would not meet its European launch date of September 23, instead being pushed back to mid-October release. As if that wasn't bad enough for hungry European Sega fans, many people are now preparing themselves for another delay, this time until November. 
<p>Speaking about a second delay for Sega's live-or-die console, one ECTS attendee said, "The rumors began in Berlin and it wouldn't surprise me if Dreamcast slipped again in Europe." However, Sega says it still expects to launch on October 14.

<p>Sega announced today their anticipated early sales records for the Dreamcast. It is currently predicted that the system will generate nearly $45 million in sales within its first 24 hours of availability, breaking the previous record set by Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. The George Lucas epic managed to take in $28 million in its first days in the theater in May of 1999.
<p>Peter Moore, senior vice president (and apparently the company spokesperson since Bernie Stolar's departure), had this to say. "Sega Dreamcast is making video game history with a long string of firsts and superlatives. Topping the retail sales record set by a movie as celebrated as Star Wars: The Phantom Menace would prove that all the hard work over the past years to get the right retailers, third party publishers and technology partners on the board has paid off in spades."

SU will be shown in Canada on Teletoon beginning Monday @ 5:30. Check out the 
show's listing <a href="http://www.teletoon.com/Programs/Sonic_En.htm">here</a>.
Teletoon, being a Canadian Specialty Cable Channel, would only be available 
in the U.S. to people with satellite dishes. SU, combined with a series 
adaption of Brian Jaques 'Redwall' books, should make for Teletoon's best 
season since its founding two years ago.

This was bound to happen.  First some of the Sonic site webmasters call this latest Sonic cartoon incarnation terrible, now Ken Penders has gone on record saying it as well:
<p><i>If anyone wants to know where to point blame regarding SU, one need look in the direction of the producers of the series. They're the real villains of this piece. Sega wanted to have a SONIC cartoon on the air, and in order to do that, they either had to go along with the program at DiC or it just wouldn't have happened. Subsequently, lots of decisions were made for all the wrong reasons. I myself know a lot of what really happened, but I can't say yet because of promises made.

<p>There's always the chance some other Sonic cartoon will emerge again, because if there is a demand waiting to be filled, someone will always seek to capitalize on it.

<p>If you like SU, fine. If you don't, that's understandable.</i>

<p>These are pretty strong words, and that combined with all the negative feedback from fans means it's no wonder SU is at an "Off the Air" status in the UK.

<font size=-1 face="arial">
The release of SU has been rather confusing, thanks to numerous delays and the fact that it doesn't seem to be showing on the same time and channel in any 2 areas.  I'm hoping to clear things up with this report.

<p>First, SU is not part of a network.  When we say that it's showing on WB or UPN, we mean that it's usually on a local station that is affiliated with one of those networks.  Those stations have more open areas in their schedule than a station affiliated with a larger network.  SU could show up on a Fox station or a fully independent station, but we've heard no reports of this happening so far.

<p>It seems that the long delay in the United States was caused by Sonic Underground's distributor, Bohbot Entertainment.  Bohbot wanted to make SU part of a 2-hour block of programs called BKN2.  BKN1 ("action shows" marketed to older boys) and BKN2 (shows with less action, marketed to girls and younger boys) were supposed to be sold to competing local stations in the same time slot.  Apparently, things haven't worked out exactly as they planned.   Personally, I think this was a stupid idea, because real people's tastes aren't predicted so easily by stereotypes.  Fortunately, it seems that SU is showing up in some places on its own, so Bohbot may be allowing stations to buy shows individually, instead of forcing them to buy the entire block.

<p>As Zifei mentioned earlier, you really have to check your local listings to find the show.  You can find searchable listings at msn.com, go.com, ultimatetv.com, and tvguide.com.  Many (if not most) areas don't seem to be getting SU yet, but that may change in the next month.
