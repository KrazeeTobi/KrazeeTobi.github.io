It looks like Robotnik is really back, check out the preview for Sonic #73 below:
<p><i>SONIC THE HEDGEHOG #73 

     <p>Written by Karl Bollers, art by Steven Butler and Pam Eklund. 

     <p>"The Truth Is Out There." The madman himself might be gone, but his evil lives on. Robotnik's satellites link to
     each other in orbit, forming a mega- sized Space Base!!! Meanwhile, back on Mobius, Sonic's parents are about
     to celebrate their wedding anniversary -- complete with new wedding bands fashioned from power rings. The
     celebration is cut short by the threat of the space base, and Sonic and the Freedom Fighters are space-bound to
     investigate. That is, if they can get off the ground -- for just as they are about to leave, they receive a distress
     signal from Sonic's parents urging them to return at once. What diabolical menace has befallen the heroes now? </i>

     has ever seen, but can even Knuckles surmount the hardest task he's ever faced: figuring out how to ask Julie Su
     out on a date? It's the most heart-wrenching, gut-churning chapter yet in the life of everyone's favorite echidna.

     <p>It's zap versus zip when Sabrina The Teenage Witch battles Sonic The Hedgehog in a special story which leads
     into Sonic Super Special #10, shipping next month. Enchantra, the cranky Queen of the Other Realm, is furious
     with Sabrina. She's also discovered a way to explore alternate realities, and when she comes across the planet

Someone flamed Alessandro for giving a good review of SU, and got this response:<p>
<i>Why don't you believe him? He's never lied to us before. Stop being so cocky about it until you see it. Then say what you like, but until then, surely one can only accept what the people say who HAVE seen it? They say it is a good cartoon, it's just not SatAm, which is, to them, a shame. I don't see why that makes you think it'll be so awful. None of the changes are any greater than the changes they made FOR SatAm, although they are admittedly less plausible. Well actually no, thinking about it; how is an amulet that changes into a musical instrument any more unrealistic than a magic gold ring that comes out of a lake every however many hours?

Ever since the release of the Sonic Undergound images and movies over the net last week, opinions on the cartoon based on the short clips have ranged from pure hatred to "I like it!" Here's a short quote from the person that put up the Sonic Underground media, Alessandro:
<p><i>IMHO the cartoon is _not_ going to suck, and it's definitely not like  
AoStH or Scooby Doo.  In fact it was quite enjoyable, reaching a quality  
similar to SatAM, with fun, excitement and adventure.  I never doubted  
that it would be good... all I ever said and complained about was that it  
would have been so much *BETTER* if they had used Tails, Sally and the  
others, instead of contradicting basically everything the SatAM show had  
introduced and established.</i>
<p>Remember now, this is the same guy who ripped apart AoStH and Archie for being low quality. So a note to everyone out there who's going hate-crazy over it already, at least watch a whole episode before you judge it! Low quality 18 second clips really don't show much.

<p><i>I heard from a friend of mine(he works for SOA) that there is a new
Sonic game in the works. It is currently known as Sonic Realms.Sonic
will be able to travel time periods. Each time period is called a
realm.Again all Sonic characters are playable.This game is just on the
drawing board.And some of the Sonic Team members are researching
in Redwood(headquarters of SOA, don't ask me why they're
researching in Redwood). Sonic Team is working on NiGHTS 2 so
Sonic Realms is still on the drawing boards.

Paul Castiglia, the director of sales at Archie Comics, is also doing the sub story in Sonic #70. Here's what he said about that upcoming story, consider this as an official press release, since it *is* from an pro:
<p><i>
Hello, Sonic fans.  Paul Castiglia here.  Just thought I'd de-lurk to
drop a
quick note about my story, "Statue Of Limitations", which appears in
SONIC THE
HEDGEHOG #70.  Specifically, I'd like to set the record straight from
the very
beginning that the story was in no way meant to criticize or make fun
of fans.
For those of you who are very active in Sonic fandom, you will notice
that
certain individuals have been either quoted or paraphrased.  This was
done
with the permission of the people in question.  Also, the point of the
story
is basically, "what makes a legend?"  Well, for me, part of the answer
is that
when someone is [transcendant] in their actions -- when someone really
strikes 
a nerve -- they are a lot of things to a lot of people.  And certainly,
there 
are many people with many different views on Sonic.  As far as I'm
concerned,
everyone has a right to their opinion, and the right to voice it --
since they
are opinions, they're certainly valid -- because I believe that if just
one
person holds them, they are validated -- even if I or others disagree
with 
a particular opinon.  

<p>So the point of the story is, no one opinion of Sonic is
necessarily "the right one" in lieu of the others; and no one opinion is
necessarily "the wrong one".  To use cliches, variety is the spice of
life; 
to each his own.  I might also point out that Tails reminds Sonic that
he's
touched people's lives, and that's why they care for him.  And while I
may not
have spelled it out literally, I believe the story also implies the
flip side
of that -- where would a hero be without fans?  It's reciprocal -- you
touch 
our lives and we'll touch yours.  

<p>So if anything, this story is a celebration of fandom.  
Another aspect of this, of course, is how the hero feels about fan
worship.  
Some are humble, and some feel they're not worthy, and I've always
found 
that interesting -- when I was writing Conservation Corps, my
collaborator 
and I would do signings and we actually had followers, fans who loved
what 
we were doing and even thought about the characters and stories more
than 
we did, anticipating future developments.  And we were just humble -- 
after all, we were just two regular guys who lucked out and got a
chance to
have our characters see print, but we weren't "comic book superstars"
by any
stretch.  So we were ultimately thankful that people would actually be
that
touched by and that involved with our creation.  

<p>LAST BUT NOT LEAST: 
on a technical note -- there is a mistake in the credits for this story
-- 
Barry Grossman is credited with lettering while Vicki Williams is
credited 
with coloring.  The reverse is actually true.  That one just slipped by
in
production, but I guess that's why they're called "mistakes"...

<p>Thanks for listening...

This is heating up to be a pretty nasty matter, is Archie being sexist toward Sally when they moved in Elias to take the throne and didn't let Sally have a say on it? Well, Ken Penders answered this question on his forum, he also gave out some more comic information regarding future events in his little statement below:
<p><i>Elias is older than Sally. Even if they were born fraternal twins (which we haven't made up our minds about yet), Elias emerged
first.
<p>As for the line of succession, it's not a case of first born male, but rather first one born. Elias came first, ergo, he is first. Nothing
sexist about it. However, it was presumed for the longest time that he was dead, so the King had any problem with his
DAUGHTER becoming ruler. What he has doubts about is whether or not SALLY is up to the task of being a monarch.
<p>Incidentally, the very topic of who should succeed King Acorn gets a major-league answer in the FEMALE FURRIES
SPECIAL, in the Princess Sally story titled "ASCENSION".
<p>Side note here: The woman at Sega who reviewed the story where the King decreed that Sally married Antoine was initially
offended by that, until we pointed out that we had neither Sally agreeing to the arrangement or the King geting the last word.
We were basically setting up a situation. How it's resolved is what determines whether or not we're being sexist.</i>
<p>Now we'll have to wait all the way to the Female Furries special to find out what will happen, and that won't come until around SSS#11 or SSS#13.

As we reported first last week: Sonic Underground, the new Sonic cartoon is showing in France, yes, FRANCE, right now. Here's what <a href="mailto:solly@club-internet.fr" style=text-decoration:none>Solly'n Hedgy</a> from France, has to say about it on the Sonic newsgroup:
<p><i>Sonic has a brother Named "Manic" and a sister named "Sonia", They are the
children of a royal family, and decided to fight against Robotnik.
Each character symbolize an instrument, and each have a magic medal having
the figure of their instrument, Sonic is the guitar, Manic the Drums and
Sonia the piano. I seen in the episode of this wednesday, that Sonia has the
possibility to call a special gun which look like a Synthetizer with the
help of this 'necklace .
<p>In Sonic Underground, Sonic is a lot more careful and intelligent than in
"STH" (the show with Sally)...
Manic like to steal (that's somewhat his job)...
And Sonia has some stuffs looking like Sally...
<p>The heard "Sheriff Robotnik"... At least, is simply the Robotnik we all know
from "STH", And there's 2 new characters in the side of Robotnik, one is a
robot-wolf called "Louvois"  (I'm not sure of the spelling) We pronounce
"Louvoaa".. and the other one is a strange big yellow robot-monster .. which
can be transformed into "STUFFS"...called "Durdur"</i>

appearing in the FEMALE FURRIES SPECIAL, though I'm not sure yet what issue of SONIC SUPER
SPECIAL this'll be yet.
<p>He's also at work on a very special book-length SONIC SUPER SPECIAL story, but I can't say much
about it nor do I know which issue yet as it'll be scheduled once it's complete.</i>
<p>The Female Special would most likely end up being SSS#11 or SSS#13. Spaz might be working on SSS#10, which probably is the second part of Sonic #75. We don't know much about it right now because everyone's keeping quiet on anything about SSS#10.

<p><i>Many of you might know by now that The Sonic Oasis was temporarily shut down for a little over

for their customers to place MP3 files in their domain, they thought mine were regular MP3s, but I
have made them from scratch myself. I asked them when I'll be getting my website back, and they
told me that it was okay for these MP3s to reside here. After I gave them my URL, they checked
into it, and found that there is nothing wrong with the site. That's gratitude for ya, eh? So now that
everything is coming back to normal, the sounds section might still be broken, but those of you

This is <a href="http://www.videogames.com" style=text-decoration:none>Videogames.com</a>'s impression of Sonic Adventure running on the monitor with the VGA Box just released by Sega of Japan:
<p><i>Sonic Adventure: Of the three games tested, Sonic Adventure benefits the most from the
      VGA Box. To say that this was the best looking console game ever was certainly true. Now
      it's plain fact. With the VGA Box in tow, Sonic and company practically burst off the
      screen. Super-high-res and, as with VF3TB, the light-sourcing becomes much more obvious.
      In fact, details that you never noticed before, like the furry textures on Sonic and Knuckles,
      and even some subtle details in the title screen appear with the use of the VGA Box. Head
      over into one of the action courses, like the Emerald Coast, and everything moves by at a
      blinding pace, that also seems to benefit, however, slight, in the frame-rate department.
      While the VGA Box doesn't help the hardware with this, perhaps it's the high refresh rates
      of the monitor that irons things out visually. Either way, it's the gamer that benefits. </i>
<p>Then hear <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" style=text-decoration:none>National Console Support</a>'s impression:
<p><i>Sonic Adventure is VGA compatible so we
    popped that in for a run. The details that are
    brought out by the VGA Box are evident on the
    Sonic Adventure logo screen. To the right of
    the lettering is a faded image of stairs and
    'castle' walls. We never noticed that before.
    The battle with the puddle creature shows off
    the micro details that one may not notice with
    a standard video display. As the camera
    pans around the puddle beast, you'll notice
    that the water inside of it is in constant
    motion with mini waves, streaming bubbles
    and turgid random movement. Even as you
    dash into Mr. Puddle, it's body continues the
    watery dance inside, oblivious to the battle
    outside.
       <p>Emerald Coast never looked so good with
    a realistic ocean, a sandy beach, blue skies
    and brilliantly colored beach umbrellas. It
    looks warm. The seagulls overhead are crisp
    and the palm trees appear true to life. One
    thing that we found ourselves doing was
    stopping Sonic at various vantage points to
    rotate him to get a 360 degree view of his
    surroundings. Just to see how everything
    looked with new video. The DC does nature
    scenes exceptionally well. Rock formations
    look like real rocks while trees, ferns and
    mosses look like real flora. Sonic is a
    gorgeous game and the VGA Box brings it all
    out. Sort of like video makeup. NCS
    condones S-Video but VGA is nirvana. XRGB
    upscan fans and purists should absolutely
    pick one of these up. Nothing is better for DC
    video at this stage of Dreamcast
    development.</i>
<p>Sounds good to me...

Sonic Adventure made the Weekly Famitsu top 100 games list for 1998. It stayed on at #73. It's really good considering it came out a week before 1998 was over.

Has dropped again, far enough for it to fall completely out of the Top Ten Chart. But sales for the game is expected to rise during the next two weeks. Sales right now are around 350,000.

I walked into the book store today and happened to see a "Previews" book while there. So I
     picked it up, flipped to the Archie section, and looked at the cover of Sonic #72
<p>AND GUESS WHO'S ON IT?
<p>Robotnik!!! The cover had the SA Sonic (green eyes and long spines included) stopping in
     his tracks as a "HAHAHAHAHAHA" is on the front cover! A HUGE Robotnik face is
     plastered all over several television screens that are on a store display in the background of
     the pic!
<p>The story is called "I, Robotnik", is written by the usual guys - Bollers and Butler and
     Eklund - and has to do with the first official inagural broadcast of television in Mobotropolis.
     But instead of the regular scheduled program, they end up getting the history of "Dr.
     Robotnik". So it looks like this story will be about his past as well. 
<p>From what it seems the Doc is NOT back in his tangible form in the book YET, and its
     unknown if he will posess the new SA design for himself as well - but if the cover with the
     giant head is any indication. He's baaaacccckkkk....
<p>We'll have a cover for you by tomorrow or Saturday, so stay tuned!

This is on the MP3 situation from JD Harding of The Sonic Corner...
<p><i>Hello Sonic fans,
     I recently recieved an e-mail from Richard Jacques after asking
     permission to allow me to add his music to my site (The Sonic Corner). This
     is what he had to say in terms of a response:<p>
     "Thanks very much for your email. I am glad you like my music. With
     regards to the state of the internet, this has really been a big issue for
     me recently. It seems all of the ISP's are cracking doen on EVERYTHING. I
     have had a lot of email from people exactly like you. The love games music,
     they love Sega, they want to have the music on their site. The official line
     from our legal department here at SoE, is that people are in breach of our
     copyright. There is a clause on the game packaging and in the game itself
     about not reproducing any part of the game in whole or part, and the
     soundtrack is quite a large part. OK, annoying but I agree Sega has to
     protect it's intellectual property. BUT I think the point is that people
     can't get this music. Sure, people who buy the game can listen to the music,
     but in the case of Dreamcast and other formats, you can't just put the disc
     into a regular audio CD player and listen to the music. It's a completely
     different format. So, Sega really need to provide the fans with dedicated
     soundtrack CD's. Sure, you can get the odd import from Japan, but often they
     don't have any remixes on, they're expensive and they may not be popular in
     the US and Europe. The only thing I can say is for as many people as
     possible to email me, telling me about this problem. I am going to try and
     setup a record label to produce quality soundtrack CD's,and to include
     remixes and bonus tracks, that Sega can sells. I am sure people would pay 10
     bucks or something. Let me know what you think, and spread the word and get
     people to email me. It gives me a good case when I speak to my boss."
     <p>Sick and tired of Sonic import CDs that cost 30 dollars and you really
     don't know what you're getting? Richard has the idea to make remixes of his
     own music, and sell if for 10 dollars each CD! Wouldn't that be better than
     30, plus the cost of import mail charges? E-mail him and send him your
     support on this. Please, if you own a Sonic website, put a copy of this
     letter on the website. Richard needs lots of support, and I for one would
     like to see his music on soundtrack covers.
     <p>Richard's e-mail address is: jacquesr@soepd.sega.co.uk

Check out this quote about Sonic Adventure:
<p><i>Sega has put a new Sonic VMS sound data file in the internet, after you downloaded the data into the
         VMS, the next time you play Sonic Adventure, at the title screen Sonic will give you brief explanations
         on each menu item in English.  To download the sound data, you have to first upload your score to the
         internet, then fill up the survey, and it will ask if you want to download the sound data. </i>
<p>The interesting part is, did Sonic actually speak in English? If he did, then the person doing his sound should also be the person that does his sound in the whole American version game. I'm trying to confirm this right now, might have more info later...

I guess everyone was surprised when SOJ decided to have Sonic's eyes green in Sonic Adventure! But I had just received the Sonic R CD from Japan and on the <a href="http://www.din.or.jp/~koryan/sonic/pic/scd04.jpg" style=text-decoration:none>cover</a> of it, Sonic has green eyes (and this was released before Sonic Adventure!)

I found this really good website about the Sonic Adventure mini-games the Sonic Team lets you download via Internet. One would hope that they would be available for the gamers here when the DC arrives. Click <a href="http://sj.znet.com/~kbender/dc/sa/sa.htm" style=text-decoration:none>here</a> to view the page.
