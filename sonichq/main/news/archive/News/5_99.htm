<p><i>Even though I have the excuse of NOT writing the current issues of SONIC, you'll notice I haven't

This is NOT a joke. Sega has announced today that they will develope for the Nintendo Gameboy/GBC. The reason is that Sega doesn't plan to take a step into the handhold ring anytime soon.

<b><font face="arial">Violence And The S&K Comics</font></b> - Zifei 3:51pm CST, 5-26-99</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

Ken Penders wrote a pretty long editorial to Ron's list after he read Dan's #73 review about the comics seeing too much violence. Below is the responding letter:
<p>After reading Dan's review of KNUCKLES #26 and a couple of your
comments 
regarding the use of violence in the back-up stories appearing in SONIC
#72 
and 73, I thought I'd take a moment to address the issue head-on.

<p>At the time I wrote the opening sequence to KNUCKLES #26, I debated
with 
myself, especially after reading Dan's comments when he read a sneak
preview 
of the first six pages, whether or not I should go ahead with the
opening 
sequence as is.  In the end, I likened it to some of the over-reacting
the 
characters in many of the Warners cartoons had committed, and let it go
at 
that.  

<p>In retrospect, ever since the massacre of the students in Colorado, 
I've revisited that debate many times, and while I may have regrets,
there's 
a part of me that wonders where the line should be drawn.  I don't have
any 
easy answers.  I know what I was exposed to when I was growing up, and
I sure 
didn't come away with a desire to blow away my fellow man. I've recently reread a number of comics from the 60's and 70's, not to
mention also watching videos of a number of movies from the same era,
and 
I have come away from the the experience with these observations:

<p>- Your average Comics Code Approved book portrayed killing and adult
vices 
such as smoking and drinking in a much more open and graphic manner
than you 
see today.

<p>- your average PG and R-rated movie contained a lot more questionable
material
than many of the films today.  They certainly had more nudity, sex and
drug 
use than most films today do.  The only aspects I would say are more
prevalent
now over then are the increased body counts and more rapid-fire editing
style.

<p>What differs [sic] the 90s from the 70s is the amount of material
produced 
as well.  On the other hand, your average film back then had a wider
audience 
than most films do these days.  The same holds true for TV, comics,
etc.  
It's all a niche market these days.

<p>Addressing the back-up stories in SONIC, these are meant to establish
an 
[official] back-story and timeline once and for all, in answer to a lot
of 
requests.  While the stories are my creation, they are based on
established 
events or "facts" that were part of the series long before I came
aboard.

<p>In deference to Ben Hurst, while I have no problems with what was
established 
in the SatAM series, I knew in regards to the comics that if we kept
going 
long-term (which we did), certain things would come back to haunt us
regardless.

<p>By establishing the kingdom of Acorn had been in a Great War prior to
Robotnik
seizing power, a great number of thorny questions would have to be
addressed,
leaving aside the issue of King Acorn making Julian his "Warlord".  As
soon as
the questions "who was the Kingdom at war with" and "what started the
Great War"
are asked, immediately the problems with the series premise for its
intended 
audience are apparent.

<p>The series would have been a LOT better and stronger conceptually if
the 
people at DiC had simply written a premise where there once existed a 
peaceful Kingdom of Acorn, and from parts unknown on Mobius came the
vile 
Robotnik, who threatened to destroy the Kingdom's way of life.  With
that 
simple premise, you have set up Sonic against Robotnik, the episodes
would 
have been basically the same with very little rewriting, and more
important, 
you wouldn't have all these disturbing questions needing to be
answered.
But as everyone knows, that's not what happened, and we did end up with
disturbing questions needing to be answered.


<p>In SONIC #72, the violence is entirely off-panel.  You never, ever see
the 
Prince take the shot.  Even the blood was not colored as blood, so as
not 
to glorify or exploit the whole situation.  

<p>In fact, the entire episode is 
portrayed as a tragic accident that could have, should have been
avoided.  
Paladin is portrayed as being upset at what he has done.  He takes no
pleasure,
nor is there a lack of guilt on his part.

<p>As for SONIC #73, the villains are shown to be bad guys plain and
simple.  
I don't try to obfuscate and paint in shades of gray.  There simply are
no 
redeeming traits to these characters.  The brutality, however, is again
played 
off-panel.  Again, no glorification or pleasure is meant to be derived
from 
this sequence.


<p>In both instances, events are portrayed that would justify why two
sides 
engaged in a bloody war with each other.  


<p>If you didn't have events such as these, 
then what else would justify a war, and what would make King Acorn feel
he would need someone like Julian to win it for him.  (That King Acorn 
would even need a Warlord is something I've always had a problem with, 
as it made him seem less of a leader.  It was like saying he wasn't 
up to the task of leading his troops against the enemy.)


<p>Which brings me to KNUCKLES #30 through #32, wherein I answer readers 
complaints about all the bad guys being wusses when compared to
Robotnik.  
Be careful what you ask for, for you may get it, and indeed you do with
Hunter, 
an overlander who has his sights set on Knuckles.  By setting up Hunter
as the 
nastiest, deadliest villain we've yet seen since Robotnik, I ran into
some 
editorial questioning over a sequence where Hunter discusses his
"hobby" with 
Knuckles.  They are in Hunter's den, decorated in a manner you would
associate 
with a hunting sportsman, including mounted heads on the walls of
previous 
quarry.  There's an empty wall plaque awaiting the head of his next
trophy.  
Beneath the plaque is a bronze plate with the [inscription] "echidna". 
[Knuckles'] reaction most likely will reflect the reader's: Hunter is
one sick
puppy.  The reader is alerted to the fact that Hunter plays for keeps,
and 
anything can happen.

<p>From my point of view when writing this, I used "The Most Dangerous
Game" as 
a basis, but I also thought of the real-life hunters, and how things
would be 
if the quarry really could fight back.  I felt that was an entirely 
appropriate action-based premise for a series like Knuckles.

<p>In every case where action or violence is portrayed, I'm very conscious
of 
who is reading the material, and I'm extremely careful in its use. 
Violence 
does play an intregral part of the series, but its usage should never
be 
gratuitous.  Individuals may not like the use or portrayal, but on the
whole, 
it would be entirely unrealistic not to mention unreasonable to do away
with 
it altogether.

<p>One final point: in today's marketplace, we walk a tough line between 
individuals like Alessandro, Dan and Ron - who would prefer we do less 
violence, with those who feel we're handling it just right to those who
feel 
we need to be even more gritty and graphic.  No matter what we do,
someone is 
always bound to be unhappy.

<p>Ken Penders

<p>The "The Most Dangerous Game" Ken stated is a story about how a crazy hunter got tired of hunting animals and started using humans as the prey. He killed many humans before running into an equal. I would suppose every school district in America teach it in middle school.

<img src="images/archive/juneGamefan.gif" align=left> From the latest issue of Gamefan (sporting a very
cool 
Spaz SA cover, I might add), I bring the news:
<p><i>Sonic Adventure is getting a new soundtrack for its U.S. release.  Yep,
apparently some of the higher-ups at Sega figure that us lowly
Americans 
won't 'get' the cool, world-music-meets-'80s-cheese-metal tracks laid
down 
for the import rev.  Nope, we're getting Sonic CD'd on this one.  Not
to be 
the harbinger of doom, but when you start emulating the management
styles of 
your less-than-successful forebears, that can't be a positive thing. 
Adding 
insult to injury, the music is of the Nine Inch Nails variety so all
you 
folks out there who're heavily into the whole industrial sound thing,
well, 
happy days.  For the rest of us (most of Gamefan) let's hope we don't
see a 
repeat of the Sonic CD import/domestic reviews.</i>
<p>Personally, I've come to like the Japan version of the music, and I
don't 
think it's SOA's place to make these kinds of changes without first
getting 
the consent of its fans (who decide whether Sega stays in business or
not, 
get my drift?)

I heard a commercial for Dreamcast today on the radio.  I missed the

couple of seconds, so I'm not sure if it was for a contest to win a DC
or a 
commercial for the Dreamcast itself, though. It talked about the
release

<p><i>"you can see the sweat on the professional player's faces"</i>
<p>It also talked about how the DC has a modem, is 16 (?) times

<p>Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders, art by James Fry, Andrew Pepoy, Chris Allan and Jim Amash. 
<p>"Business As Usual." A mass exodus to Knothole Village is underway for the frigthened Mobians, who once again
     must face the threat of the recently returned Robotnik. The only problem is, Robotnik might have a computer file on
     Knothole's exact location. Can Sonic and the Freedom Fighters find and destroy the file before the citizens of
     Mobius are roboticized? It won't be easy, with all the Shadow Bots on their trail. But an unlikely ally named Snively
     just might hold the key to victory. "Tales of the Great War." Part four. The series of back-up stories chronicling

<p>"King of the Hill, Part One of Three" . Knuckles faces off against his childhood rival, Monk, in a battle bringing a
     lifetime of grievances to bear. However, the battle is short-lived as shots ring through the air. Big game hunter
     Deadeye has arrived on the Floating Island looking for some fresh sport, and it seems he's stumbled upon a double

Well, here's what <a href="mailto:ad339@is7.nyu.edu">ElectricPhase</a> said about Sonic Adventure's North American voices from E3:
<p><i>I didn't spend a great deal of time
                       with this one, having already played through the
                       import, but I did get to look for any changes and
                       enhancements in the U.S. version. On the positive side,
                       the framerate seems more stable and some clever
                       fogging on certain levels has helped reduce pop-up. I
                       can't be sure, but the camera seems a bit better as
                       well. On the uglier end of things, the dubbing of the
                       voices seems pretty terrible. Amy and Tails have
                       crossed the line from cute into irritating, and Sonic
                       seems to be voiced by a small girl. Still, the E3 demo
                       was very well set up, allowing access to most of the
                       game's action stages, and the game itself is so
                       gorgeous and playable as to make all of its genre
                       competition look stunted and boring. </i>
<p>OK, so we still don't really know who did the voices, but at least we got an opinion on it...a bad opinion.

Sonic Adventure did show up at E3 in a big way. A large part of the Sega booth is used to show off this incredible game. The game came with a few Sonic events where people dressed as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy went on stage to show off the game. So far the reaction to the game has been great. Here's a quote about the NA version of Sonic Adventure from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com">Gamespot</a>:
<p><i>Sonic Adventure is receiving the greatest facelift for US gamers. Sega's representative, David Karraker of Access Communications, said that 12 of Sonic's Japanese developers came to the States to see the project through, including improved cameras, restructured voicework, and a lighter load of FMV sequences. Apparently, according to Karraker, the difficulty level with not be adjusted for the US.</i>
<p>No word on just who the voice actors are yet. But rumors floating around the industry do suggest it will be J. White playing the role of Sonic.

<b><font face="arial">Sega's Marketing Plan.</font></b> - Zifei 3:38pm CST, 5-13-99</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">

<font size=-1 face="arial">

Read this press release carefully, as it outlines the entire Sega USA marketing plan:
<p>LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 12, 1999--Sega® of America today announced
                 further details surrounding their $100 million marketing campaign for the much-anticipated
                 Sega Dreamcast(TM), ``the ultimate gaming machine.'' 

                 <p>Prepping for the biggest videogame launch the industry has ever seen, Sega is armed with
                 an arsenal of far-reaching marketing elements ranging from an expansive print and
                 broadcast advertising campaign; to promotions with Pepsi; to full sponsorship of the
                 ``SuperBowl'' of the young adult demographic -- the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. 

                 <p>At launch on 9-9-99, consumers won't be able to go about everyday life without thinking
                 about or seeing Sega Dreamcast. This kick ass marketing campaign will ensure for a blitz
                 before, during and beyond launch, the likes of which the videogame industry has never
                 seen. 

                 <p>The marketing campaign for Sega Dreamcast is aimed to hit the enthusiastic nerve of hard
                 core gamers. Knowing that the die hard gaming community is the heart of their business,
                 Sega is 100% dedicated to this consumer with marketing, events, promotions, but most
                 importantly -- the hardware and games that will get consumers excited about Sega
                 Dreamcast. 

                 <p>``Sega has been in this industry for more than 40 years and the company has deep roots
                 and history with the gaming consumer,'' said Peter Moore, senior vice president of
                 marketing, Sega of America. ``We are committed to this audience and can't wait to show
                 them the face of the 'new Sega' this year through our ads, promotions, events and activities
                 that touch them directly.'' 

                 <p>The introduction of Sega Dreamcast will encompass all parts of the target consumer's life
                 through unforgettable advertising, sales promotions, event marketing and retail
                 merchandising. The campaign will focus not only on the emotional, visceral experience one
                 gets from Sega Dreamcast games, but also on the hardware and the ways it is setting the
                 benchmark for videogames. 

                 <p>Advertising 

                 <p>Created by Foote, Cone and Belding, San Francisco, the first stage of Sega's print ads will
                 have a cryptic feel, focusing solely around Sega Dreamcast's signature swirl logo.
                 Consumers will see the swirl popping up in various natural, organic places, giving them the
                 feeling that something living, breathing and big is coming. These ads will be featured in the
                 gaming publications through June. The cryptic phase will be followed by four other stages
                 of ads for pre-launch, launch, holidays and in Winter 2000 -- a critical software selling
                 period. 

                 <p>Sega's television advertising campaign will kick-off in July of this year and run through
                 March 2000. Six innovative television spots are being created by Pacific Data Images, the
                 same company that created images for the movie ``Antz.'' Look for Sega Dreamcast
                 television ads on the WB Network, prime time television, sports-related programming and
                 other stations tying into Sega's key demographic. 

                 <p>Worth noting, Sega Dreamcast will have 950 television spots on MTV alone from July
                 through March 2000, buys on ESPN and Monday Night Wrestling. With an impressive
                 media buy, Sega Dreamcast will be everywhere, as consumers watch television come this
                 summer. 

                 <p>But the ads don't stop with traditional media. Sega, in a partnership with Pepsi, will
                 sponsor ``Hot Topics'' (advetorials), which focus on cool happenings in movies and pop
                 culture. These two pieces will run before movie trailers from June -- August on more than
                 11,000 screens across the country. These spots will be tied-in with the new Arnold
                 Schwarzenegger movie trailers and will hit when the highly anticipated ``<b>Star Wars</b>'' and
                 other hit summer movies are running nationwide. 

                 <p>1999 MTV Video Music Awards 

                 <p>On 9-9-99, the same day that Sega Dreamcast is launching, Sega will be a full sponsor of
                 the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards show, airing live that evening to an audience of
                 approximately 22 million. Considered the ``SuperBowl'' of the young adult demographic, the
                 MTV Video Music Awards typically play to an audience of young men and women aged
                 12-24 -- which makes this an ideal marketing marriage between the two companies. 

                 <p>Sega will show six advertisements both before and during the 1999 MTV Video Music
                 Awards featuring Sega Dreamcast. The system will also be featured at the awards show
                 post-party. In celebration of the launch, Sega will be conducting local market consumer
                 promotions in which consumers can win trips to the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. 

                 <p>Promotions 

                 <p>Key to the marketing program for Sega Dreamcast are promotional opportunities with
                 mass market vehicles. Sega is continuing to line up large-scale consumer promotions
                 which partner Sega Dreamcast with a host of products specifically targeted towards people
                 in the mid-teen to mid-20s market. 

                 <p>Product Placement 

                 <p>Sega is currently conducting a ``celebrity and sport celebrity seeding'' program for Sega
                 Dreamcast to ensure that ``everybody that's anybody'' has a Sega Dreamcast. In addition,
                 there is also a seeding program already underway that will place Sega Dreamcast on the
                 hottest shows, movies and music events.

All the while the Star Wars theme is playing in the background, then they arrive at a theater (?) with the chiwawa saying "Let's do it" (?), and the screen turns black, with the words "the Sega starts now" (or something like that).

In the L.A. Life section of the Daily News today, there was an article about the Electronic Entertainment Expo
     (E3) runing Thursday to Saturday this week at the Los Angles Convention Center.
     E3 is going to be showing off some soon to be released games and consoles. Among them, Sonic Adventure and
     Dreamcast.
     Some quotes from the article:

<p>"...the star of this really big show will likely be Dreamcast, the next-generation gaming coscole from Sega."

 <p>"The Dreamcast - realeased last winter in Japan and debuting here in September - is the fist console to use
     128-bit computer chips to generate increasingly realistic graphics."

 <p>"Sonic Adventure, with Sega's blue hedgehog mascot, is so fluid that it's almost too fast."

<p>"After the Saturn's faliure to excite the market, Sega is betting big on the Dreamcast to revive its gaming fortunes,
     spending an estimated $500 million worldwide to market the machine this year."

<p>Not much new except that it's good to see Sega getting the media spotlight. On another note, Nintendo announced their new system today. "Project Dolphin", as it's called is a joint effort by Nintendo, IBM, and Panasonic. For more info, click <a href="http://www.gamefan.com/newhotinfo/hotinfo.asp?storyid=1311">here</a>. It'll not be out until 2001.

<p><i>Because of certain scheduling neccesities, it was decided just before I left for NY for the convention at Madison Square Garden that KNUCKLES: THE CHOSEN ONE would run in KNUCKLES #36 through 38, with RETURN TO ALBION following after that if all is still going well. (This much is certain, things will definitely remain status quo until KNUCKLES #35 and the completion of the SONIC ADVENTURE adaptation. After that, anything can happen as of now.)</i>
<p>It seems the storyline has been pushed back due to Sonic Adventure, let's hope Knuckles (the comic) doesn't die by then...

Sorry about the no-update yesterday, I was too busy making the new Sonic HQ...and it was my Mom's birthday (you better be glad your mother's birthday isn't within 1 day of Mother's Day).
<p>Anyway, Software Etc. is showing a new Sega promotion video distributed by SoA. In the video is a clip of the North American version of Sonic Adventure. Here's what DC Prophet, someone who saw it said:
<p><i>Pretty much the exact game as the import version but i did notice the helicopter sequence done a bit smoother at a slightly diffent camera angle. Mostly the same game. Sega said they were working on fixing all the problems but most of them were camera problems which didn't seem to show themselves on the video and colision, which didn't happen often to biggin with, also didn't rear it's ugly head...there was still some pop up though.</i>
<p>Hope Sega is smart enough to add a few more levels...

Well, according to the latest Famitsu magazine (the real famous games magz in Japan), the Sega AM2 developed Sonic the Fighters have a 10% chance of making to the DC.

In an ultra-slow news week, here's a filler
<p>Rich Koslowski, you know, the inker of Sonic? He wrote a book about the comic industry, or at least it seems like it from the quote below:
<p><i>"There's way too much of that stuff," said Rich Koslowski, whose critically lauded Three Geeks series salmons stoically against the industry's downstream. "Three Geeks is an all-ages thing. No blood and guts. No nudity. A lot of people have called us the Seinfeld of comics. That's the best compliment we've gotten."

<p>Koslowski, who started his career as a storyboard artist on shows like Sonic the Hedgehog and Double Dragon and went on to work with Archie Comics, has been to so many shows like this around the country that he decided to build a book about the people who attend them.

<p>Three Geeks, Koslowski said, "does not make fun of comic book collectors, it has fun with comic book collectors."</i>
<p>You advanced comic readers/future comic industryers might want to check it out...whatever it is...like I said, it's a filler.

Sonic Underground has started in England, on ITV's Diggit (related to
Disney!) 
<p>The cartoon itself is okay apart from the high pitch voices of the
three hedgehogs [expect Manic who has a low voice]. The amination also is okay but not excellent, if you ever watched the
new versions of Ace Venture, that's the type of animation your going to
get from this. One bad thing, THE MUSICAL INTERVALS, I hated it so I
muted it on the TV. If I had to rate it, it would get a 7/10
 <p>So this is kinda of a shock, Sonic Underground is still not on in
Amercia and now it has started in England not on Channel Four but on
ITV. It is okay, should have a look at it when it comes on TV over
there.
