I have just gotten off the phone with my friend, who works with the Sonic team. This person, who shall remain annoymous (at his request of course) has informed me that the Sonic Team is going to develop Phantasy Star Online for Gamecube! This confirms that the Sonic Team IS developing for other consoles, and the Gamecube will have it's own online network! <P> My friend has also informed me that Sonic Adventure has not been pushed back to the fall, but rather has been pushed ahead to January 30th, 2001!

Didn't Sonic #95's spoilers JUST come out?  I like it when things are ahead of schedule, but the spoilers are here at Sonic-speed!  Or is that Mina-speed?  Anyway, at this rate, #97's spoilers will be here in... oh... 5 days, 6 hours, and 22 minutes.  I'll be waitin'!!!<br><br><marquee><b>I FINALLY BEAT WB TO THE SPOILERS!  CHEER ME, DOUBLE‡CROSS!  HAHAHAHA!!!  :þ</b></marquee><br><br><br><br><i>Sonic the Hedgehog #96<br>Written by Karl Bollers & Ken Penders<br>Art by James Fry, Ron Lim & Ken Penders<br><br>"The Messenger." The answers to many questions are revealed - and a few new ones are raised. Has his Majesty's Secret Service learned of Sonic's heroic, secret trip to Robotropolis? Will Princess Sally and Sonic finally see each other again? Has Dr. Robotnik finally figured out a way to get back into Knothole Village?<br><br>32 pages, $1.99, ships on April 6.</i><br><br>The Spaz cover looks odd to me... mostly because I can't tell what's happening.  Sonic and Mina are being chased by one of those SatAM-ish hoverpods, and... are riding some kind of hoverbike?  I dunno!  That's what it looks like!  Or some big robot in front of them?  Curse my 20/30 vision!!!  I'll wait for it to be colored...<br><br>And what's this... "Has Dr. Robotnik finally figured out a way to get back into Knothole Village?"???  He finally got into Knothole?  Cool.  ^^<br><br> This will be another issue that Fry and Lim will pencil.  Fry's work, IMO, is excellent, but Ron Lim, as quoted by someone I know, "is the devil."  We'll see how it comes out, though.  Ken Penders also writes and inks the Knuckles story, which is missing spoilers again.  Well, at least it ain't Ron Lim.  :)<br><br>This also marks another issue where Sonic and Mina star on the cover together.  The question "Where's Sally?" has been on the minds of many fans, and it's on mine, too.  Since Mina is scheduled to become Sonic's new "love interest", who knows where Sally'll be???  Probably going for Mina's throat...<br><br>The events leading up to Sonic #100 are proving to be more interesting with every bit of new information.  I wonder what they've got planned for it.  ^_^<br><br>That's all for now.<br><br><p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.comicscontinuum.com"="_whole">Comics Continuum</a><br>

<div class=itemtext>
While maybe not earth-shattering news, small Sonic-themed figurines can be bought as you play the new marvel game from Sega: Shenmu.  While it really does nothing to the advance the game, it's fun to see the 3-D Furs.  So far, all but two characters from Sonic the Figthers have been found (the two missing being Metal and Super Sonic) by me.  Another note of intrest is that they are by their Japanese names (i.e. Nack is called Fang and Dr. Robotnik called Eggman).<br>

I do believe Sonic HQ is incorrect on something.  On an earlier post, someone noted, and I quote:<br><br> <i>Another thing to note, ODCM </i>[Official Dreamcast Magazine)<i> has also announced that the release date has been pushed back until Fall of 2001. The reason for this being is because Sonic Team wanted to ensure that the Sonic Team would have enough time to make the game everything that they wanted it to be. </i><br><br> I do believe I heard it'll be delayed elsewhere too, but I don't remember where.  And now, they say just to the right of this post, and i quote:<br><br><i>Sonic Adventure 2 is set for release on February, 2001</i> <br><br>  Now I think they are wrong on the February thing and I do believe it was pushed back but I could be wrong.  I just don't want anyone to get their hopes up and I hope Sonic HQ corrects their mistake.    <br>

They've also created this brand new desktop wallpaper on their site for the occasion, download it: <a href="http://samba.dricas.ne.jp/pc/DOWNLOAD_W/WALL_PAPER/samba2k_dl01_large.zip">1280*1024 (1250KB)</a> or <a href="http://samba.dricas.ne.jp/pc/DOWNLOAD_W/WALL_PAPER/samba2k_dl01_small.zip">800*600 (470KB)</a></p>  <hr>  <p>Phantasy Star Online has been reviewed by Famitsu Weekly of Japan, given a 37/40 mark, with a Platinum award, here is what those wacky Japanese said about the game, thanks to <a href="http://dc.ign.com">DC.IGN.COM</a>:</p>  <p><b>1ST GUY:</b> If you can handle the price of the phone system and the game itself, you should definitely buy it. Simply communicating over the system is fun. It's possible to chat in real-time without any stress. When you're in the room, you can become a new person. I felt like there were wonderful possibilities! When you play off-line, it's an average action-RPG. - <b>SCORE: 9</b> </p>  <p><b>2ND GUY:</b> You can play the game off-line single-player. However, you can go on-line to play as your own character. You can defeat your enemies, share the items you earn, and cooperate with your buddies via the chat mode. It's fun to experience the adventure with real-life people. If you dare to give candid advice, there may be some problem in cooperation. - <b>SCORE: 9</b> </p>  <p><b>3RD GUY:</b> The underlying system is fairly simple. As you defeat enemies, your player's level slowly goes up. Single-player mode gets tiring. Why do the multi-player modes become so interesting? Talking with people while you fight is too much fun! You can't feel any time-lag, either. People who are connected to the net will want to try it. - <b>SCORE: 9</b> </p>  <p><b>4TH GUY:</b> This is the first really complete consumer network game, and I applaud its perfection. You can enjoy the game with people you've never seen before, or play the game by yourself thanks to the decent gameplay system. It feels more like Diablo, but the game really shines because of the Yuji Naka touch. - <b>SCORE: 10</b></p>  <hr>  <p><img src="http://www.segaweb.com/media/pso/psonline.jpg" align="left">SegaWeb have recently had the pleasure of watching both a new SA2 video, and a PSO video, heres the <a href="http://www.segaweb.com/news/1200/113.html">link</a>. This is what they concluded:</p>  <p><strong>SA2 </strong>  <ul>   <li>A new character seemed to exist. He appeared to have Knuckles' skills, such as climbing     and flying, but this character was white. Super Knuckles, perhaps? </li>   <li>A robot character, much like E-102 was seen in the footage. This robot was playable, and     was racking up insane combos with its laser.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>PSO</strong>   <ul>   <li>Sonic Team did not really demonstrate the online play from the game; they focused mainly     on the interface and the single-player gameplay</li>   <li>To summarize: It kicks ass ^__^</li>   <li>Sonic Team guided the character from the outdoor areas to the main lobby section, which     allowed for a great demonstration of the games menu interface. </li>   <li>The Menus are VERY important to this RPG's Gameplay, if you don't know Japanese, don't     bother importing :)</li>   <li>everything in Phantasy Star Online seems to be customizable. The character was shown     equipping armor and weaponry, and it looked like he not only was able to select from a     truckload of items, but he was also able to alter the color/designs of the items     themselves. </li>   <li>Sonic Team then showed off the motion capture from the game, and how it played a key     role in making Phantasy Star Online's characters more lifelike. They also displayed     several icons that exist in the chat features of Phantasy Star Online, among them being     Doraemon symbols (A fat, blue cat with a magic pocket.. also it has no ears :), NiGHTS     symbols and Sonic symbols. Perhaps these are Sonic Team's versions of smileys? :)</li>   <li>Sonic Team apparently wants to make Phantasy Star Online have date-specific downloads.     Much like Sonic Adventure had its Christmas Square, Sonic Team wants Phantasy Star Online     to have a special graphical alteration done to it on Dec. 25, three days after it is     released. </li> </ul>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://tssz.emulationzone.org">The Super Sonic Zone</a> has reported although Famitsu gave PSO a 37/40 rating, Famitsu Dreamcast, it's sister magazine, gave it a perfect 30/30! The game will come out around about the 27th of January in the US, and about a month after for the PAL release.</p> <br>

Following the news and rumors of Tails maybe or maybe not showing up in SA2, I have run across the ODCM (Official Dreamcast Magazine) and this is something that they have just reported about SA2:  <br><br>  <i>"Although only a few characters have been revealed so far (Sonic, Knuckles, and Dr. Robotnik), sources tell us that five new characters, pulled from former Sonic games on Genesis, Game Gear, amd arcade platforms, will also join the party-introducing new styles of game play in the process."</i>  <br><br>  This could mean that Ray, Mighty, Nack, Espio, Vector, Charmy, Bean, Bark and other Sonic characters who haven't been seen for many years could make a comeback.  <br><br>  Another thing to note, ODCM has also announced that the release date has been pushed back until Fall of 2001. The reason for this being is because Sonic Team wanted to ensure that the Sonic Team would have enough time to make the game everything that they wanted it to be.  <br><br><br>  Source: ODCM (Official Dreamcast Magazine)<br>

<b>Sonic #95 Spoilers - The Chosen One Starts Now....</b> - WB 6:08 am 12-15-00

Dub here! And today we get the long awaited Sonic #95 spoilers! Bunnie Rabbot fans will definetely want this one for the first story. But Miles "Tails" Prower fans - buckle your seatbelts: "The Chosen One", the final Knuckles arc before Sonic #100 and the follow up to one of the biggest side storylines in Archie starts here.....  <p><hr> <a href=http://www.sonichq.org/comics/images/covers/sonic/large/sonic95.jpg><img src=http://www.sonichq.org/comics/images/covers/sonic/thumbnails/sonic95.jpg align=right></a><b>Sonic The Hedgehog #95</b> <br>"Enemy Mine" <br>"The Chosen One - Part One"  <br>Written by Karl Bollers and Ken Penders <br>Art by James Fry And Ron Lim  <br>Inks By Andrew Pepoy and Ken Penders.  <br> <br>A trip to Robotropolis to rescue the roboticized Overlanders baffles Sonic and Bunnie, as many of the Overlanders haven't even been roboticized! Meanwhile, Kodos has gone over the top, affected by radiation, leading Sonic and Bunnie to assist Arachnis in battle against Kodos as they attempt to make their way through the Great Forest. Is Kodos' condition part of a bigger threat? Can Arachnis be trusted? And just what can Robotnik be up to by allowing the Overlanders to exist free of roboticization? And in the backup story - His fellow enchidnas might not have the answers to Knuckles' problem, but Athair believes he does. He recruits Tails, along with Merlin Prower, to assist with the solution, leading to the moment many have asked for: the ultimate destiny of Sonic's major domo revealed...  <hr> <p>Coolness. Not only do we get a story with Sonic and Bunnie (my personal fave of the FF's) but we get the long requested Chosen One arc that I know a bunch of you will be happy to hear, plus the return of Athair as Tails may possibly meet his uncle Merlin Prower who hasn't been seen since back in the day. :)  <p>As an off note, the miniature version of this cover doesn't really do it justice. Sonic trapped in Spaz's "Spider Man" webbing makes this a SWEET cover and probably his best one in a while just for the layout. I'm not that happy with Ron Lim doing the art for the Knuckles/Tails back, but overall this looks to be a pretty good issue in the making. And if it follows the upswing trend the books have been taking since #88 (skipping SSS#15 - it doesn't exist >_<) then #100 may be looking good after all... <br>

And we hope (and pray) that this rumor is true and that such a compilation will be released next year. A rumor always has its roots, and perhaps they're buried somewhere deep in Sega Japan...I cannot WAIT until February. :D  <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://segadreamcast.ugo.com/ target="_whole">Sega X</a><br>

<b>Two Adventures! Two Sonic's? Too Much Information!</b> - WB 13:04 pm 12-11-00

<div class=itemtext>
<img src=http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/images/screenshots/dc/sonic2/sonic2_b2_screen001.jpg align=right>It's TWO - TWO - TWO TIMES THE FUN! But where on earth is our little 2-tailed kitsune Tails?  <p>At least thats what the major videogame sites are saying concerning the latest Sonic Adventure 2 demo (which is RUMORED to be in one of the next ODCM's). From these off the wall "Nails The Bat" new character rumors, to the Dark Sonic, to the missing Tails, to the now playable Eggman its obvious that we're in for a 1oth Anniversary treat either way!   <p>You've seen the IGN article below. Here's the Daily Radar scoop (in red):  <p><font color=red>The wily Sega had many surprises in store for the assembled throng of videogame journalists at the company's Executive Games Summit, which was held last month in San Francisco. At the two-day event, Sega showed off approximately 30 titles, all of them scheduled to come to Dreamcast in the year 2001. It was a glorious overdose of all things Sega and, for reasons unknown to all but the people who put the event together, certain materials were made off limits for coverage; a nondisclosure agreement provided Sega the legal right to assault those who discussed certain games before a certain date with flesh-eating beavers. With the passing of December 7 (the infamous day when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, forcing the United States into the global conflict known as World War II), the nondisclosure has lapsed on Sega's Sonic Adventure 2. Now it is safe to say that Sega showed the game's first level at the Executive Games Summit, and it was spectacular.  <img src=http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/images/screenshots/dc/sonic2/sonic2_b2_screen005.jpg align=left> <p>The game will celebrate Sonic's 10th anniversary, and centers around the creation of a new and sinister ultimate weapon, which happens to look a lot like a black hedgehog. The game will look similar to the original Dreamcast launch title Sonic Adventure, and will feature Sonic, his echidna pal Knuckles, the vile Dr. Robotnik and those beloved virtual pets, Chaos.  <p>Sonic Team's Takashi Izuka, the man who created NiGHTS for the Sega Saturn (and who refused to comment about the game being made for the Dreamcast), was on hand to show off Adventure 2. He brought both a brief preview movie of the game, as well as a working demo of its first level. The movie showed brief flashes of gameplay, all fueled by pounding guitar sermons that seem to be the hallmark of such promotional material. Sonic himself was shown skyboarding, sliding down an anonymous hilly town with cable cars (San Francisco), using his board to grind along rails, swinging on vines, interacting with chaos and being an all-around bad-ass.  <p>The demo for the first level proved revelatory. The first series of levels is titled "The Trial" and begins with Sonic riding in an attack helicopter. At this stage, Sonic is a prisoner, but his captives, as well as their motives for capturing the beloved mascot, were not revealed. Nonetheless, the plucky hero escapes his bonds, and hurls himself out of the chopper. Gameplay begins when he lands on terra firma and starts sliding down the streets on a board. Here, Sonic was shown sliding at great speed and with great fluidity. (Izuka promised Adventure 2 would have a frame rate that improved on the original 30-fps Adventure.) During jumping tricks, he would rocket into the air and begin spinning wildly, Tony Hawk-style. In a fit of videogame goofiness, Sonic was also shown knocking cars aside on the way down. The demo concluded with a visually stunning scene of Sonic racing toward the front of the screen while being chased by a rampaging truck. It was clearly a tip of the hat to the mad killer whale scene in Adventure, but was nonetheless remarkable.  <p>Izuka then answered a series of questions about the game -- that is, he answered by saying he was unable to answer. He passed on the question of online support for the game, although he did acknowledge there would be some. He did not comment on the possibility of NiGHTS for the Dreamcast, but was able to say that it would be possible to shift Sonic's movement while he's grinding down rails in Adventure 2.  <img src=http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/images/screenshots/vgnews/092600/sonicadventure_screen005.jpg align=right> <p>All in attendance were allowed to play the game later that day. The demo sampled is the same one that will be packaged with the Japanese version of the online Dreamcast game Phantasy Star Online, although Sega showed it to American game fans first. A brief playtest revealed that the game did, in fact, run at about 60 or so fps, and had graphics that were both sharper and cleaner than those of the original Adventure. It was simply fun to play as well.   <p>As an added bonus, Sega sent all in attendance a copy of the demo on the date that its nondisclosure agreement lapsed -- along with a nice note saying, inexplicably, that the playable copy of Sonic Adventure 2's first level was not to be written about until December 21. Expect a full preview, as well as many screens and movies, on that date.  </font>  <p>Sounds cool, huh? Couple that with the news above and it looks like were gonna be in for some GOOD GAMING come the 10th Anniversary! Now all we need is to find out the full truth behind Tails and these unconfirmed Nails rumors and see what happens. ^__^ Does anyone else wonder if this "Nails" may be the Dark Sonic in question? For that we'll just have to see. For now though, you can also check out Videogames.com's review of the demo, as well as thier new screenshots shown here linked below.  <p><b>SA2 Demo Review #2:</b> <a href=http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/filters/0,10850,6014070,00.html target="_whole">Videogames.com</a>  <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://www.dailyradar.com/ target="_whole">Daily Radar</a><br>

<b>Mina Maid</b> - WB 10:36 am 12-11-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
<p>James Fry recently brought up some things concerning Mina The Mongoose's development on the Archie Mailing list in reference to a letter in response to Dan Drazen. An excerpt from the responsive letter is below:   <p><font color=yellow>Mina was always intended to be a mongoose, hence my remark wondering whether or not we made her species clear from the beginning. In point of fact, she was a mongoose before she was named Mina. The character was originally named Chloe, and changed to Mina at the 11th hour because so many of this book's female characters' names end in that "long-e" sound: Sally, Bunnie, Rosie, Amy... you get the idea. But the mongoose thing (clearly labeled on the character-design sheet Spaz sent me), the super-speed and the maybe = girlfriend thing have all been part of the plan for ages. I'm not saying stuff never gets made up on the fly, just that this certainly isn't one of them. </font>  <p>I wont reprint the full one. But check out the mailing list for more of the discussion. :)   <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=mailto:rdbaurle@juno.com>Archie Sonic Mailing List</a><br>

<div class=itemtext>
<img src=images/shuffle.gif align=right> Well - some are saying Sonic Shuffle is pretty good - some however are damning it to the lowest bowels of Sonicdom. Gamefan is one of the latter following echos of reviews from fans and VG pages alike as they've graced it with a whopping 42. :P Here's an excerpt from thier review:  <p><font color=cyan>One of the things that made Mario Party such a success were its fantastic mini-games, they were quick and easy to understand, and you were involved in one at least every turn. Sonic Shuffle&#8217;s mini-games really aren&#8217;t that swell--while a few are mindless and fun (like the wooden labyrinth game), most are either unnecessarily complex, banal, or just plain stupid. For example, in Sonicooking, one player flips a giant frying pan while the others try to stay inside and collect rings. There&#8217;s zero challenge to stay in the pan because the flipper cannot move it fast enough to knock you out. A safe cracking mini-game has you turning a knob ad as soon as the other player sees a &#8220;!&#8221;, they open the door. Whichever team can do this faster wins. Lame. And here&#8217;s the real kicker. You really don&#8217;t play that many mini-games during the course of play because you have to land on specific spaces to activate them, and there are really very few of them on the board. You don&#8217;t even get to complete in a free-for-all mini-game at the end of everybody&#8217;s turn like in Mario Party. </font>   <p>'Taint funny Sega!

<b>Older Tidbits From Ken Penders</b> - WB 4:05 am 12-11-00

<div class=itemtext>
Ron cleaned out his mailbox yesterday and graced us with Sonic Mailing List potpourri from Ken Penders (in red and the actual letters in cyan)! I wont reproduce everything here (Go to Kens board or subscribe to the list ya lazy twit!) But I thought the Robo-Robotnik news was interesting enough to post here. ^__^  <p><font color=cyan>What I'm wondering is, if you wrote all of #51-present (with Mike Gallagher possibly doing the issue #3 reference story with Al and Cal like he did with "Opposites DETRACT") Would we be seeing Robo-Robotnik right now?</font>  <p><font color=red>Yes, but as for how different than Karl has done, it's hard to say. Initially, when we killed off Robotnik in #50, Sega allowed us to do so with the provision he be brought back six to eight months later.  We just kept pushing it off for as long as possible for a variety of reasons -- storyline, marketing and even production considerations.  The only major difference is that I wouldn't have used the name Robo-Robotnik after explaining where he initially came from.  I had planned to use Robotnik Mark 2 and avoid any confusion over the mattter.</font>  <p><p><b>Subscribe:</b> <a href=mailto:rdbauerle@juno.com>Archie Sonic Mailing List</a><br>

<b>Big Bully Sony Picking On The Stores?</b> - WB 3:58 am 12-11-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Here's something interesting...In recent days, it has been no secret that Dreamcast has been enormously benefiting from Sony's blunders in launching the PlayStation 2, with even Sega of America's President speaking on the matter.   <p>Recently however, Sega X says that theyve been receiving word that something is not right in the World of Gaming... at least in America, anyway.   <p>Barnes & Noble, owners of Babbage's Etc., Software Etc., Funcoland, Gamestop, and more, appear to be involved in what could be seen as blackmail. So what do they have to back this? Well, according to them theyve had numerous employees from stores owned by Barnes & Noble, reporting the news that the stores have been told to remove all X-Box advertising, and stop pushing Dreamcast as much. The rest from Sega X's article:  <hr>  <p><i>Sound rather unlikely? Well, we've went as far as to quote an employee of Software Etc. on the situation:   <p>When I asked my district manager (about the situation), she said: "It is a company-wide mandate that we are to take down X-Box promotion materials." When I asked her why, she said that "we have obligations to other companies right now and we don't need to be pushing the X-Box." When I asked her if it was because of Sony, she said "That's possible but I'm not totally sure."  <p>We've been hearing from other sources that Sony have indeed contacted Barnes & Noble regarding the situation.   <p>So, is this Sony showing Microsoft-like bully boy tactics? We'd be surprised if this wasn't true, after hearing it from so many sources, there has to be one common link. It would be interesting to see if the law comes into play, but until then, we can't say any of this is concrete.   <p>A good way to find out is to call your local store, or if you go in and see that most X-Box materials have been removed, then it is more than likely the case of Sony. As of this moment, Gamestop.com is still advertising X-box -KP  <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://segadreamcast.ugo.com/ target="_whole">Sega X</a>   <br>

 Hey there folks! When I was on the Official UK Dreamcast Magazine's website, well to be more exact, the online chat, a person claimed he new further details on SA 2, when people questioned him, he said that Tails would indeed play one of the biggest roles in the game. It appears that this person believes he knows who created Dark Sonic, when questioned by chatters, he said Tails created Dark Sonic! <p> Could this be yet another Nails the Bat rumor, or something more? Well time will only tell, to be infact, we will see whether or not this guy was an imposter on February 2nd 2001, the scheduled release date for Sonic Adventure 2. More information on the release date go to: www.express.com and search 'Sonic'. <p> Remember folks, there are an awful lot of rumors and theories going around about SA2, so don't take any particular one toooooooooo....serious^_^<br>

<b>To Tails or not to Tails</b> - Sonique -Empress of the Epocholypse- Hedgehog 1:56 am 12-09-00

<div class=itemtext>
Well, we've seen no pics of him so far and the big question is, IS TAILS IN SA2???  The answer is<br><br>  No one knows! <br><br> The official Dreamcast magizine in the UK stated:<br><br> <I>In a recent interview with Yuji Naka, the guy who created Sonic, Official Dreamcast Magazine were asking questions about Phantasy Star Online and the new Sonic Adventure 2 game coming out early in 2001. When asked if Tails was going to be in Sonic Adventure 2, Naka replied that no he wasn't. When they then asked if Tails the Fox would make a comeback he said he couldn't say anymore which suggests that Tails may come back seeing as most developers say things like, 'Sorry but we have finally scrapped this.' I hope this will end months of specualation of Tails being in SA2.</i><br><br> And Sagesages said this as well:<br> <br><i>In the Preview Yuji Naka it is made clear that <b>Only Sonic, Knuckles and Dr. Robotnik</b> are the surviving members of the original cast and he points out that the Dark Hedgehog plays a big role in the story. What ever the Dark Hedgehog is it will be big as even Yuji Naka refuses to talk about it. </i><br><br> That should end speculation right there, two sources said Yuji Naka himself said no Tails, but WAIT!  There's more.  Gamespot got their hands on a preview and had this to say:<br><br> <I>Sega first showed us a brand-new trailer for the game that showcased Sonic Adventure 2's enhanced graphics and hinted at the storyline. From what we could tell, <B>Sonic, <U>Tails</u>, and Knuckles are the primary heroes in this game</b>, and their quest involves both Dr. Robotnik and a brand-new character. Though the trailer wouldn't show the character in full view, it did show several close-ups of his face, enough to allow us to make an educated guess about his identity...</i><br><br> So, the answer to this question still remains unanswered after all this time.  Hopefully the real answer will be revealed soon...<br>

<hr>
<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
<hr>
<font color=red>Sega has confirmed that it is stopping production on all Dreamcasts and will be moving on to develop for other systems.</font> Theres a _LOT_ to this story and if you wish to learn more you can read the reprinted article and discuss your opinions on the situation at The Station Square Newsboard.

<font color=red>The landmark 100th issue of Archie Comic's "Sonic The Hedgehog" will be out, August 2001.</font> Titled "Darkness Falls", one of the main characters - a good guy - will go bad and become the "Ultimate Villian". The preview cover of Sonic #100 suggests it's Knuckles, but it MAY be a fake cover.
<hr>
Reasaurus Toys are currently in the process of making thier <font color=red>Sonic The Hedgehog - Series 3 Toy Line</font>. Characters will come from Sonic Adventure 2 and will consist of Sonic, Shadow, and Rouge. No other figures or a release date is known at this time.
