<div class=itemtext>
<a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com target="_blank">IGNDC</a> has released info and movies on Green Forest: <p> <i>When you start off the Green Forest level, you have eight minutes to complete the stage before it blows up! Yeah, we don't know who the heck would decimate a forest (well, besides corporations like Exxon), but if Sonic has to run, no problemo! The Green Forest level is a pretty dangerous level as one bad jump will send Sonic down to the watery depths... and as we all know, hedgehogs can't swim. The level design of the Green Forest is fantastic as it follows the true principle of any Sonic level; while you can get through the game carefully, there's always a faster path that allows you to zoom by the level even faster... so long as you have the skill to do it! I really implore you dear readers to check out the movies as they really demonstrate how the level design of the Green Forest is made for our favorite turbo-charged hedgehog. Also, The Green Forest is the two-player battle level for Sonic and Shadow where both characters are trying to out race each other to the Goal Ring!</i> <p> You can check out the new screens and movies <a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/33923.html target="_blank">here</a>. <p> <b>Source</b>: <a href=http://dreamcast.ign.com target="_blank">IGNDC</a><br>

<b>PR. GERALD ROBOTONIK!?</b> - Vector 12:28 pm 04-25-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Some interesting stuff is on Sonic Team's English SA2 page.  It's confirmed that the military is after Sonic because they think he's Shadow, and that all the characters go to a space station named ARK that contains the "Eclipse Cannon."  Slightly surprising is tyhat Tails apparently is just as good with machinery as Robotnik, and Sonic and Knuckles are listed as "friends."  However, the big surprise is in Shadow's profile.  It says that he was built by "Pr.Gerald Robotonik."  If this isn't a translation mistake, then Sonic Team is either using the English name for Eggman for another character, or the game could intro one of Robotnik's relatives. <p><b>Source:</b> <a href=http://www.sonicteam.com target="_whole">Sonic Team</a><br>

<div class=itemtext>
Sonic Team's SA2 page has info on some of the game's bosses.  Of course, the character vs. character battles are back, but the 2 other bosses mentioned are a surprise.  Big Foot is a mechanical walker built by the military and one of Sonic's bosses.  It belongs to the "Scorpion Troop."  Shadow fights Hot Shot, a flying military machine that chases him and fires on the ground (which sounds like a very cool boss, IMO).  It belongs to the "Spider Troop."  No clue what these "troops" are - maybe competing teams attempting to catch Shadow?<br>

Ok, now I know the Satam DVDs must be true, cause when my friend and I were getting a soda at Target, we were browsing around the store to kill break time from college, when something unusual cought my eye.  As I wondered down the bedding section, I was amazed to find.......SONIC THE HEDGEHOG AND PRINCESS SALLY!!!!  That's right!  This is no joke, Sonic the Hedgehog AND Princess Sally were on sheets, pillow cases, bedspreads, and of course....PJs!!

<b>SA2 Music @ Napster</b> - EspioKaos 13:44 pm 04-21-01
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
If you do a search on Napster for Sonic Adventure 2, you'll usually get a nice little collection of MP3s to show up.  There're all those files that came from the demo disc like &quot;City Escape:  City Escape,&quot; &quot;City Escape:  Chased by Semi!,&quot; &quot;Invincible,&quot; &quot;Round Clear,&quot; &quot;Title,&quot; &quot;Escape From G.U.N.&quot; (that one's probably part of Theme of &quot;SONIC&quot;), and &quot;Speed Up.&quot;  Then, there're those other files like Theme of &quot;SHADOW&quot; (called &quot;Dark Sonic's Theme&quot; and &quot;Warrior's Shadow&quot; at Napster) and &quot;Hyper Knuckles vs. Super Sonic.&quot;  <p>[sarcasm]  Oh, look!  What ever do we have here?  Could it be <i>new</i> SA2 music?  [/sarcasm]  <p>NO!!  It's a fluke!!  &quot;Dark Sonic's Theme&quot; is actually from another game:  Street Fighter III:  Third Strike.  Here's a news story from <a href=&quot;http://tssz.emulationzone.org/&quot;>TSSZ</a> that was written about this fake SA2 files (submitted by Sorok Echidna):  <p><i>Someone on Napster is playing us all for fools.  <p>When I saw the update on TSSZ about Hideki Okugawa writing Dark Sonic's theme, the wheels in my head started turning. I remembered that Okugawa composed the soundtracks for *all* versions of Street Fighter III- not just New Generation, but Second Impact and Third Strike as well.  <p>And Warrior's Shadow sounded an awful lot like a Third Strike tune... like Urien's theme, to be exact. It didn't sound quite the same as the DC version, though, so I downloaded the arcade version of the theme, and sure enough... there's our &quot;Dark Sonic theme&quot;.  <p>Mystery solved. I would encourage Napster users not to trust any &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; MP3s they find. Apparently, someone thinks it's funny to fake us all out.</i>  <p>So, there's one mystery solved.  Now to the second one:  Hyper Knuckles vs. Super Sonic.  <p>Actually, this time, this song is (more-or-less) a &quot;Sonic&quot; song.  It's just not from Sonic Adventure 2---it's one o' the remixes from that Sonic Adventure Remix Album.  This song is a remix of &quot;KNUCKLES:  Unknown from M.E.&quot; from Sonic Adventure, by Cevin Key.  Nothin' more.  <p>Sorry to you guys out there if you've been disappointed by this---I'd <i>love</i> to get some more <i><b>genuine</b></i> MP3s of music from SA2 just as bad as some o' you, I'm sure.  But, I guess we'll just have to wait for the OST of SA2 to come out.  (Hopefully one'll be made.)  Anyway, it's better to know the truth than to fall in line with all the fake stuff.  <p>Vec Note:  Thanks to NetRaptor for exposing this too, but I put up this article posted on the Station Square forum because it's the most detailed.  Another way to spot this as a fake is the fact that a level is called &quot;Super Sonic vs. Hyper Knuckles,&quot; because that's an Archie matchup, and Super Sonic vs. Super Knuckles would make a lot more sense.<br>

I just got home from seeing the Josie and the Pussycats movie, and Sega seems to be sponsoring the Josie movie, because throughout the movie, you can see PLAINLY in a store, the background had Space Channel 5 plastered ALL over the place. And in the final act, there is a sign in a huge arena that says "Sega Megarena". Sonic was NOT spotted at all, but it shows how much of a team Archie wants ta be with Sega. The movie IS good, so check it out when you get a chance.<br>

Sonic and Princess Sally reunite for the first time since Sonic was divested of his knighthood, but it's not quite what the heroic hedgehog had in mind. Ironically, it all takes place in that mechanized metropolis of Robotropolis, but that's not the most shocking surprise: the bittersweet reunion is made even more so by the loss of one of Knothole's own. Plus: another Knuckles back-up story. The recent exploits and intrigue of Knuckles collide in one combustible story, as Knuckles faces off against Dimitri and the Dark Legion. The fact of literally everyone on Mobius hangs in the balance, not to mention Knuckles' family and friends, helplessly trapped in another zone. <p> 32 pages, $1.99, ships on July 27. <br>

<b><a href="http://dreamcast.ign.com/" target="_blank">IGNDC</a> has a new report out on Sonic Adventure 2:</b><p>And for the good boys and girls, we have new details on what could end up being the best Dreamcast game yet, Sonic Adventure 2.<p>In <i>Sonic 1</i>, it was Sonic versus Robotnick.<p> In <i>Sonic 2</i>, it was Sonic versus Mecha Sonic.<p>In <i>Sonic 3</i>, it was Sonic versus Knuckles.<p>And now, in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>, Sonic Team has decided to go way crazy with the rivalry thing. It seems that everyone will have a rival in this game. Sonic has a rival in Shadow, a new character. Knuckles has a rival in Rouge, also a new character. And, according to Japanese Dreamcast website Dreamcast Station, Tails will find his rival in Robotnik. This could be first "unofficial" confirmation that Tails will actually be playable in the game, although we ain't sayin' nothin' for sure.<p>The game's story will focus on what's called the Hero Side versus the Dark Side, apparently emphasizing these rivalries. Even the Chao characters can have Hero/Dark attributes. The story will come in two forms, and what we've read makes us believe that one storyline will have you play as the good guys (Sonic, Knuckles and Tails) and the other storyline will have you play as their rivals (Robotnik, Shadow and Rouge). This later part is conjecture on our part based off what we've read though, so don't be surprised if the final product is different.<p>Depending on the character you play as, the game will take on one of three different forms. For Sonic (and possibly Shadow), the game will be best described as a 3D Action title. For Knuckles (and possibly Rouge), the game will be best described as a Rare game - err, I mean - a Treasure Hunting title. For Tails and Robotnik, the game will be best described as an Action Shooter.<p>Included somewhere in these various game genres is a two player mode. Split screen? Online? Or is Sonic Team approaching the two player mode messy like they did with Sonic 2? We expect to find out soon. <p> <b>Source: <a href="http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/33166.html" target="_blank">IGNDC</a></b><br>

<font color=red>Charles Bellfield has confirmed the existance of a joint Nintendo/Sega project that may be in the form of an RPG</font>. Other than the fact that it exists, nothing else (such as whether it will involve Nintendo and Sega characters or if its a new series entirely) has been confirmed on it. HOWEVER this story does correlate to a much OLDER rumor that a Nintendo/Sega RPG starring Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario was in the works. We'll keep you updated on anything new.
