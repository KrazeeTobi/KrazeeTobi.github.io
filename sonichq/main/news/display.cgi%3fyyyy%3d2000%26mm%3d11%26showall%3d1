<b>Sonic on Nintendo? ODCM says nope!</b> - Sinko 16:38 pm 11-24-00

<div class=itemtext>
I just recived ODCM issue no. 10 today, and right in the letter of the month box was a letter I sent them a few weeks ago. I had asked if Sonic Team would be developing for other systems, and here's they're answer: <P> <i> Hey Chris, there seems to be a lot of confusion regarding what will happen to Sega since it's formerly internal development teams were split off into independant companies. For now, all of these teams are now only involved with making games for Dreamcast, NAOMI and NAOMI 2 arcade boards (as well as the occasional PC and handheld port). There have been rampant rumors about some of them taking their acts to to other platforms, but Sega has remained very firm in its proclimations that this is untrue.<P> We here at <b>ODCM</b> have heard it all (both the rumors and the denials) and we doubt that any of the theams will be developing for other systems under the Sega brand for a long, long time. On a side note, we've also heard through the grapevine that this rumor often strikes fear into the hearts of third party publishers who release games on competing systems, simply becuase Sega is such a revered game developer in Japan! No third party wants to compete with games like </i> Jet Grind Radio <i> and </i> Shenmue<i>. But for now, it looks like they have nothing to worry about: Sonc Team et al are still Sega acolytes. So relax Chris- Dreamcast is still the only place to see next-generation Sonic.</i><P> Next to the letter was a picture of Sonic and a PS2 with Sonic laughing out loud. <P> So it seems like we have nothing to worry about, at least with the Sonic Team. I'll try to keep you updated with any new info about this subject-and so will everyone else :-). <br>

<div class=itemtext>
TSSZ just got some news on the new Sonic Compilation GD-Rom for DC, to be released sometime next year. Here's what Tristin had to say.<P>  <i>We have just received an update on what is in the proposed Sonic compilation disc for the Dreamcast. It looks like all the Sonic Team made Sonic games will be in there, meaning Sonic 3D Blast and Sonic R are out. However, this could mean that we would see Sonic 1, 2, 3, and Knuckles, in addition to Sonic CD! It also looks like the Sonic Team will be trying to put the late Sonic X-Treme on the disc as well! As you may know, Sonic X-Treme, though not made by the Team themselves, was developed by STI (a division of SOA) as a Sonic platformer for the Saturn. Development was then cancelled for unknown reasons.<P>   We also have word that this new compilation CD, to be released in 2001, would span two GD-ROMs. As for extras, we have no idea what will be included yet. <P></i>  <b> SOURCE: <a href="http://tssz.emulationzone.org"> TSSZ</a></b> <br>

<b>Walmart = More Sonic Merchandise</b> - Blaze Hedgehog 15:46 pm 11-21-00
</table></div>

<div class=itemtext>
Well, after my 5-day absence from the net, I actually <i>LEFT</i> the house, and went to Walmart.<p>  Of course, I checked for the new SA Series 2 Action Figures (resaurus) but what I found instead was strangely odd. Walmart is now carrying an assortment of Sonic the Hedgehog bath supplies. Or so, I'm assuming. What I found was a small little water game, with Sonic on it. On reading the back, it said "Look for more Sonic Bath Supplies brought to you by -someoffbrandcompany-"... It was one of those cheesy little "press the buttons to make the rings land on the posts" games, and the top opened up (I think) for the soap or whatever.<p>  Another thing I found, which striked me as odd, is the latest Tiger Electronic's gimick games, entitled "Tiger Arcade". They feature those cool little low-res dot matrix screens like seen in the old Tiger 99x games. Walmart had only Hydro Thunder, and Q-bert for now, but on the back packaging, one of the games listed -- Sonic Adventure. Now, most of the other games WERE Arcade games at one time or another, except Sonic Adventure. No matter, it's still on my Holiday Wishlist. :)<p>  For now, I haven't seen these at any other store. Oddly enough, at my local K-Mart, anything even resembling a Dreamcast or periphiral for it has vanished -- save for one small little memory card. No games, no systems, no nothing. Although, Hap-hazardly stuffed into the games case was a literal MOUNTAIN of PS2 games and PS1 games. So many infact, that if one were to open the display case, they'd spill out onto the floor. <p> Well, that's it from me. Later guys. <br>

I'm not sure if this has already been mentioned-- sorry if it has-- but in the latest issue of the UK Official Dreamcast Magazine, as well as a Yuji Naka interview that we've all seen before (you know, the 'Air NiGHTS' one), there's also a short SA2 snippet. It has two new screenshots, a close-up of Sonic sliding down a San Fran hill on that weird metallic wheel-less skateboard thing, and another showing him 'grinding' along a jungle vine. Perhaps most importantly, the preview reveals the planned (worlwide) release date: summer 2001, although according to Naka it 'could be earlier'.  Also mentioned by Naka-san was that the game may have a more 'Western-aimed' taste to it than the original. As the man muses, this may be a side affect of working in the US. ;)<br>

I have talked to Sonique concerning this last night and Neon Chaos pretty much made it evident in his own news post that SOL is sadly dead. Personally speaking, I have nothing against SoL, I visited it myself, in fact, like I said, though I have not talked to NC I talked to Sonique the other night concerning this and she is moving onto other things, most noteably FUS, which I fully support her in.  <p>I personally ask all posters: Please do not clutter up the board with a moot topic as Sonique and Chaos have already chosen not to acknowledge clones in some situations. This is _SORELY_ leading Vector and myself to re-evaluate the public poster whether we need it or not.  <p>_UNLESS_ you are either Neon Chaos or Sonique and you are acknowledged by either of the two SoL webmasters, any more Shadow Of Light down/reopened/whatever posts will be deleted without question as they are the ones that made the final decision and were the head webmasters of said website. I will respect thier views and wishes not to continue and/or acknowledge advertising of clone sites and I ask that others please do the same. This board is for news not advertisemets. Thank you.<br>

Yesterday, TSSZ reported that Sonic Team wasn't just considering making a new "Nights", they were actually making it! Here's what an interview in the UK ODCM said:<P>  <i>"You know linear sensors? Well, we made this system where you could remobe the cable from the original pad and control NiGHTS like this." Naka proceeded to loop and twist a rolled up magazine in the air in front of him. After this, he continued talking. "It was called Air NiGHTS. We made it on Dreamcast for a while as well, but we stopped." <P> So why did Sonic Team decide to stop production of the game? "I know a lot of people love it and want us to make a sequel, but for us it's a really important game. Like the way Spielberg likes ET so much he won't remake it, I don't want to make another NiGHTS."</i> <P> So there you have it....while it may seem unfortunate, Naka makes a good point. <P> <b>SOURCE: <a href="http://tssz.emulationzone.org">TSSZ</b> <P>   <br>

<P>According to Sega Web, it was all one big communication problem.   <P><I>Another crazy rumor has been killed. Yesterday there were, once again, mis-translated reports out of Japan that Sega and Nintendo were involved in some grand new gaming venture along with music producer Tetsuya Komuro. The deal was supposed to involve Sega's ongoing network gaming plans.   <P>The real story is that Satoshi Kayama, director at Marigul Management, has been invited to act as an advisor to Sega to oversee their network initiatives. Mr. Kayama has worked with Tetsuya Komuro and Nintendo in the past, and this is the extent of Sega's relationship to these two entities. Sega sort of knows this guy Kayama, who once worked with Nintendo and Komuro in the past. Sheesh! Talk about needing a better translator.   <P>It's not all bad news though, Nintendo's resident genius Shigeru Miyamoto said this about the company: "Marigul helps talented programmers that don't have enough money in terms of funds to make the games they want to make." A small development team called Saru Brunei is a part of the company and is headed by former Nintendo game designer Gento Matsumoto, who served as Miyamoto's right hand man for more than a decade.</I>  <P>Source: <A HREF="http://www.segaweb.com">Sega Web</A>       <br>

I, Sonique, created a site devoted comepletely to SatAM with no SegaSonic, no Sonic Underground a little to no Archie.  I know a lot of SatAMers are out there who are afraid to express their opinions because of the amount of SegaSonicers, but FUS is a place where they can all come to hang out.  FUS will also be trying hard to revive the SatAM in one way or another, but we need members first.  Please fill out the form on the page is interested and be sure to including your email address so I can contact you.  <br><br> Please check out the page too as it has over 300 SatAM/Archie Fanfics, many o' downloads, and a page dedicated one of, if not the best, Sonic fanmade game ever, <A href="http://sonicepoch.cjb.net">Sonic Epoch.</a><br><br> Thanks for listening and I hope to hear from you all soon.  :)<br>

<a href=http://www.sonichq.org/comics/images/covers/sonic/large/sonic94.jpg><img src=http://www.sonichq.org/comics/images/covers/sonic/thumbnails/sonic94.jpg align=left></a> Loops are thrown aplenty in this preview. As if Double Cross' news post wasn't foreboding enough....now we get something that FURTHER adds to the mystery that is the road to the coveted anniversary issue: <b>Sonic The Hedgehog #100</b>...  <p><hr> "New Order 2"  <br>Written by Karl Bollers <br>Art by James Fry  <br>Inks by Andrew Pepoy.  <br> <br>As beautiful as the new Knothole Village is, Sonic just can't adjust to it knowing that Robotnik's presence - and that of the Overlanders - persists in Robotropolis. For his part, Elias has chosen the path of peace, electing to focus on turning Knothole into a permanent habitat rather than trying to reclaim Robotropolis. By issue's end, however, dark alliances shall be made and peril shall befall the Freedom Fighters - in the form of both natural disasters and wicked enemies... <hr>  <p>OK - Several things in this preview caught my eye. Namely:  <p>1. Check out that cover and one thing will <i>immediately</i> catch your eye - namely the centerpoint of Spaz's piece: <b>Knothole High School</b>! @__@ And not only that but we see Sonic walking with Tails and Mina (sans Rotor trailing behind them) in a congested courtyard nonetheless. Bunnie and Antione are walking in the opposite direction, but Sally is nowhere to be seen....It looks like after Sonic 93, Mina, Rote and Tails will be getting bigger roles after all. I specifically remember WAAAAAY back before Sonic #50, Ken Penders said he had wanted to try something like this (the high school thing) but I didn't think they'd actually play it out. THIS could be interesting...and its CERTAINLY something new that hasnt been done before in the book. Makes you wonder what on earth they have planned for after 100.  <p>2. NEW Knothole Village? Robotropolis is now populated with Overlanders _AND_ Doc R? And Elias wants to "move on" on reclaiming Knothole? And then there are the titles of "New Order" and "Darkness Falls" revealed below. It should be neat to see how this all will turn out in the end. After tomorrow - 9 issues to go till the big Double Zero...  <br>
