<p>Question:<br><textarea name=question rows=15 cols=75>Hi!  Recently I listened to the character songs for Sonic Adventure.  I really like the music, but due to bad sound quality on my own computer I can't always understand what is  being said.  I was wondering if you could tell me where I can find the lyrics to the songs.  I would really apprectiate it!  Also, while I'm writing this, I feel inclined to tell you how much I love your site!  You probably recieve hundreds of these usless compliments... but oh well.  ^_^  One more thing:  Does this ever get annoying?  I mean you poor people, sitting there answering tons of pointless questions.  ^_^  Well, have fun!  And thanks!<p>-Dark</textarea>

<p>Response:<br><textarea name=answer rows=15 cols=75>The lyrics are available on the music page.  <p>Thanks for saying you like the site. :)  It is nice to hear.  And yes, it can get a little annoying sometimes.  Thanks for understanding ^_^.
