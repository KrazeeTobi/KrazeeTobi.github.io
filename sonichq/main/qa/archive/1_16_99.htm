I don't have Sonic 3, that's why. I already have Level Select and have tried some others (Debug, Secret Special Stage), but only Level Select works. So please, I'm desperate, tell me any S&K codes you know that don't involve Sonic 3. Thanks. Also, what do Sonic and pals turn into when they get all 14 emeralds, not just seven? Again, Thanks.<br>~Mick<p></font>Sorry, I don't know of any other codes for S&K alone.  You might be able to get Sonic 3 at a used games store.  I definitely recommend it, so that you can play the "complete" game.  There are some areas in S&K that you can't reach without Tails.  Another way you can get the full game is by buying S&K Collection for the PC.<p>Sonic Becomes Hyper Sonic, which is a lot like Super Sonic, except that he glows in several colors, has "star-shaped" flashes surrounding him, and gets a spin-boost just like Vector's.  It's kinda like jumping twice with the fire, bubble, or lightning shield, except that you can control the direction - up, down, left, right, or diagonally.  When he does the spin-boost, the screen flashes and any badnik on screen is defeated.<p>Knuckles becomes Hyper Knuckles, which is like Super Knux, except that "faded" images of Knuckles appear behind him as he runs, and he causes earthquakes when he glides into a wall.  The earthquakes defeat all the badniks on screen.<p>Tails becomes Super Tails, which includes the standard invincibility and super speed, and he is followed by 4 yellow-glowing birds that sorta look like a mix of the bluebirds and Super Sonic.  The birds fly around Tails and attack any enemy that appears, even bosses.</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Super Sonic</b><br><p><font color="red">Can you answer my question my question is in Sonic 3& Knuckles when you have all 7 chaos emeralds how can you be Super Sonic? I tried with 50 rings nothing happened.<br>Sonic Fan,<br>Shelwyn<p></font>In case this is the problem, you have to do an insta-shield with 50 rings, unlike in Sonic 2, where you merely jump.  Sonic can't do it while he has a shield.<p>However, you probably know this, and I'm guessing that your problem is that you're trying to change into Super Sonic in one of the later levels.  Super Sonic and Super Knuckles are inaccessible after the "Super Emerald" stages become available.  To enter any of these stages, you must first trade in the Chaos Emerald that mathces the color of that stage's Super Emerald.  This happens automatically when you enter Knux's hidden giant glowing ring in the beginning of the Mushroom Hill Zone, or any other glowing rings afterward.</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Hidden Palace Zone in Sonic 2</b><br><p><font color="red">In Sonic 2 (Genesis), how can you get into the Hidden Palace Zone?

How does Sonic and all of his friends get to Earth? because i was pretty sure he lived on mobius. Well if you no why please tell me thanks<br>-Mike<p></font>Well, the idea of Mobius was probably not invented by Sonic Team, so as far as they're concerned, all the games have taken place on Earth.  Many members of Sonic Team may have never even heard of Planet Mobius.<p>Mobius was probably invented by either SoA or the writer of an early Sonic comic.  The comic was distributed by SEGA and also appeared in Disney Adventures.  It came out at about the time Sonic 2 was released, and I think that it was about that time that the Mobius concept was introduced (at least, I think that was the first time I had heard about it).<p>There was an older 2-page comic in SEGA Visions, which appeared a little while after Sonic 1 for Game Gear came out, and I don't think it mentioned Mobius.<p>It may turn out in the comics that Mobius actually is Earth.  Clues have been left, such as the St. Louis-ish arch in the Wolfpack back-up story that started in Sonic #67.</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Sonic's Age</b><br><p><font color="red">I just want to know how old is Sonic<br>John Knierim<p></font>16</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>What's Sonic Anime?</b><br><p><font color="red">What the heck is Sonic Anime anyway? I have heard of it but I do notknow what it is.<p></font>It's the Japanese Sonic cartoon.  In some ways, it follows the games more closely than the other cartoons and comics.  For instance, Eggman (Robotnik) looks like Eggman, and Sonic lives on the South Island.  However, it isn't exactly like the games.  They made Knux a treasure hunter instead of an emerald guardian, and gave Metal Sonic the "scanned" personality and conscience of Sonic.  As for genre, the Sonic anime is a mix of comedy, action, and drama.</font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Knux and Sonic</b><br><p><font color="red">Hey-Looking for a profile on Knuckles, and what exactly is his relationship to Sonic?

Sonic and Knuckles used to fight, but now they're on friendlier terms in the Archie comics.  It's hard to tell what their relationship is in the games, since SA will be the first major Sonic game to have dialogue.  3D Blast and the ending of S3&K seem to indicate that they're on friendly terms, but we know that Knux was created to be a rival.  In Sonic Adventure, he does fight Sonic, but apparently has a good reason for it, whatever that might be.</font></font></font></td></table></font></font></font></td></table><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><font color="orange">Jan 15, 1999</font><p><!table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000000" border=1 cellspacing=0 width=150 bordercolorlight="blue" bordercolordark="#23238E"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="blue"><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><font size="-1"><b>Thank you HQ!</b><br><p><font color="red">I find your page to be very nice, you have answer things I neverthought of.

After 4years oftrying to put back Sonic on the air, it's finally going to happen. However,a lot of fans of the comic and Satam series will be dissapointed.  Yousee,There are now four sonic cartoons:  Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonicthe Hedgehog (Satam), Sonic Anime, and now Sonic Underground.  In mypoint ofview along with a few others, 2 were the best.  Which was Sonic Animeand ofcourse the ever popular Satam Sonic.  Adventures was funny, yet stupid. SinceUnderground is syndicated, it's problobly going to suck like it'spredecesor.Underground will only appeal to the younger audience just likeadventures.However, the true fans like the Satam Sonic, because it appeals to theolderaudience which involves storylines, action, suspence, and sophistocatedcontent.  Plus there was a huge variety of characters.  So, in myopinion, theonly true Sonic will always be with the Freedom Fighters.  I just hopethatBen Hurst's solo project can rejuvinate the show and former fans withtheSonic Movie.  In reconciliation, the movie is supposed to continue theinconclusive second season.
