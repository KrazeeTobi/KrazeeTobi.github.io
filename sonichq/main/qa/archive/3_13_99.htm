<p><font color="red">
Hi! I am sort of having troubles getting all 7 time stones in Sonic CD.  How can you get them all easily?<p>
Kyle Wightman
</font>
<p>If you get a low enough total time in time attack (Debug will help you get it lower if you have trouble - see Game Info for how to get a 0'00" time), an extra time attack menu will be available by pressing Left while viewing the regular time attack menu.  On this menu, you can play the Special Zone Stages without a time limit.  This will help you to practice your Special Zone skills.<p>
Now, when you play the regular game, don't save unless you are successful in getting 2 time stones in each area (2 in Palmtree Panic, 2 in Collision Chaos, etc.).  If you are, save the game after that area is finished.  If you are unsuccessful, just go back to the previously saved game.  This will let you try each area over again.

Hi, this is Sean again. Thank you for answering my questions I submitted last week. I just have a few more questions.<br>
1. Did Snively really swear in the Sonic cartoon series?<br>
2. How long will the Knuckles comic last?<br>
3. When will Sonic Anime be released in America?<br>
By the way, this is the best Sonic site on the internet.

<p>Wow, thanks!  We're very glad that you like it.<br>
1. He only said "darn" or "dang."<br>
2. It's very popular, so it should keep going and going and going...<br>
3. If I remember correctly, it's supposed to come out on March 23rd.  Or May 23rd.  I'm not sure which.

Hi HQ, it's really been awful long time since you fix the sonic games page, i cannot go anywhere like it was the first sonic games page where it links to the sonic universe, the sonic team etc... could you please get them done as it is really annoying to go to the find section and type, wait for the whole thing to load...Benny

<p>Sonic Team and The Download Zone don't exist yet, sorry.  I don't know what to say about the Who's Who in the Sonic Universe section, though.  It works fine when I use on it.
<p>Anyway, we are trying to get Game Info fixed.  It's going to be a huge page and what could be called the 'infrastructure' is being set up right now.  The page should generally work though, except for those 2 sections and the unfinished Hedgehog That Never Was.

<p><font color="red">
In your guide to the SaTAM series, I think you missed one.  It was
where Sonic
lost his memory and was used by Snively(and Snively alone) to locate
Knothole.
Snively and the SWATbots get near the village and capture some of the
Freedom
Fighters.  However, because of a Power Ring, Sonic regains his memory. 
I
didn't see the end of this episode, and was probably one of the last
shown on
USA(and Snively probably failed).  Since only Snively was the present
villian,
could this be a lost episode of season 3?  <br>

Hey everyone.  SonIXcool is back.  Thing's are on the up and up for
me and
my pals.  For one, our old pal Sketchkidna has returned to the
SonIX-Circuit,
and he's brought with him some new team members.  The new Hype-sters
are:
Lightning Cat, Heavydabomb, Sonic Trekker, Green Goblin, and Red Raptor.
They'll be helping me and Vector J. put up a web-site and bring Sonic
fan-dom
Sonic Hype.

<p>Here's my questions.

<p>1) Alright, I know where Scorch and those others are used, but I still
don't
know who they are.  The list of chars I'm interested in are Scorch, Ami
Chobei, Hardcore, Vulpa, and Mechanix.

<p>2) For the third and final time, why did Kodos become Robotnik's mentor
is he
hated Overlanders?

<p>3) Okay, so the SWATS would loose, but what about the Com-Bots in a
fight
against the Dark Legion?

<p>4) Who do you thin would win, Mecha Sonic or Metal Sonic?

<p>5) Is Packbell a Data-type android with artificial skin, or is he C-3PO
like?
<p>Catch ya' later!
</font>
<p>1) Scorch is a hedgehog, clone of Sonic. Ami Chobei is a deer, Scorch's girl friend. Hardcore, Vulpa and the rest are aliens wanting to conquer Mobius. Why are you asking us? If you have read the stories, then you should know. Since that's the only place you'll see them.<br>
2) When did that happen? Robonik never needed a mentor...if you're talking another fan-fic, then we have no clue.<br>
3) Dark Ledion hands down.<br>
4) Mecha.<br>
5) He's an Data-like android.

Here are some questions I would like you to answer:<br>
1) How do you pronouce Espio's name?<br>
2) Is Manic and Sonia going to appear in the comics?<br>
3) If Sonic, Manic, and Sonia are triplets, shouldn't Manic be the same color as Sonic?<br>
4) Who is older, Sonic, Manic, or Sonia?<br>
5) Do you think Espio is going to have his own comic if I e-mail Archie Comics a million e-mails telling them to make a Espio comic?<br>
6) Is Espio going to be in more games?<br>
7) Do you guys think Vector is annoying?<br>
8) If I e-mail the guys at Sega to make a Sonic Underground cartoon
episode
with Espio in it, do you think they'll do that? Sorry if this is a silly
question.<br>
9) Why the heck Nintendo pick a fat plumber to be their mascot?!<br>
10) If you guys know who Pepperouchau is, could you tell me about
him/her? I'm
making a Sonic fanfic concerning about him, and the only thing I know
about
him is that s/he is Sega's fogotten mascot. I'll also be nice if you
could e-mail a picture of him/her.<br>
11) Which cartoon/anime do you guys think is better, Sonic or Pokemon?<br>
12) Do you guys think Pikachu or any other Pokemon was Nintendo's mascot
instead of the fat plumber? I do.<br>
Sorry about the Nintendo related questions.<br>
Espiogirl</font>
<p>1) Es-pee-o, it means "spy" in Spanish.<br>
2) If the cartoon does really well here, you'll see a Sonic Underground comic.<br>
3) Hmm...no. Just like Luke and Leia are twains, but they had different hair color.<br>
4) Manic is the oldest, Sonic the second.<br>
5) A million emails with the same IP address won't exactly help...that would be considered an email bomb. A better way would be to just ask them nicely through a VERY emotional letter...<br>
6) Maybe.<br>
7) The Vector that's working for us?! No! Or the reptile Vector? In that case, in the comics, sorta.<br>
8) The making of the cartoon has already ended.<br>
9) Why the heck did Sega pick a speedy hedgehog? And Microsoft pick windows? Same reason.<br>
10) Never heard of him/her/it.<br>
11) Sonic.<br>
12) Zelda is Nintendo's mascot.

<p>Sega is different today, back then it thought they could do no wrong. Today's Sega takes everything more serious, especially their mascot. And another reason is DiC is much larger than Archie, so they had more power to force Sega to listen to them. And yes, I think Archie would consider the Director's Cut a replacement for issue #50.

<p>Yes, we have heard about them. And I don't think A.J. Freda is a "loser". I respect their opinions, since some fans liked Sonic because of the 2D element.

As for the SatAM videos, we really don't know how many are out. But I can confirm Sonic and Sally, Sonic Racer, Sub Sonic, Warp Sonic, and Heads or Tails.

<p>Most likely not, because Sonic Adventure's storyline completely different from the early Sonic games. And I will say this, many people believe that the Sonic Team have never confirmed that Sonic takes place (before SA) on Mobius, well, I did some research, and found in an interview dating back to Sonic 2 days, Naka himself said the words Sonic takes place on Mobius.
