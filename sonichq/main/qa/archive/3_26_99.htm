<font size="-1"><b>Timing Question</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Hi! I want to ask a question about the water zones in Sonic 1, 2, & 3.  In each of the games, how long can Sonic last underwater without breathing?<br>

Thanks.

<p></font>

30 seconds.  It takes 5 seconds for the first "ding" warning, and the warning repeats at 10 seconds and 15 seconds.  After 18 seconds (or 3 seconds after the 3rd warning), the "danger" music and countdown start.  The countdown lasts 12 seconds.

<font size="-1"><b>Sonic 3 Shields</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Hi! I've read the manual for Sonic 3, and I found a tip that says "Beware of badniks with energy weapons". If you have a water, flame, or lightning shield can these attacks still hurt Sonic or Tails? Thanks.<p>Kyle Wightman

<p></font>

It depends on the weapon.  The Blastoids in the Carnival Night Zone shoot lightning that (I think) can be absorbed by a lightning shield, but not a water shield.  The ice crystals surrounding the Star Pointers in the Ice Cap Zone will be blocked by any shield.  Although they aren't really bandiks, there are plenty of objects that use fire as a weapon, and these attacks can all be blocked with a fire shield.  I can't think of any other badnik energy attacks in Sonic 3, but all 3 shields reflect most small non-energy projectiles.

<font size="-1"><b>Chaotix</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

Hello there! i'm 00dodger and I love your site. My questions are,<p>

1: In Knuckles#24, where the heck are the chaotix? I mean the were taken prisoner along with Julie and Knux, right? Why cam Archie have the chaotix included with knux's life! Personally at the moment, I'm sick of Julie-su!<p>

2:Is Charmy Bee ever going to come back to the comic? I miss the little 

guy! =[<p>

Thank You,<br>

00dodger

<p></font>

Thanks!  Glad to know you like our site.  I asked WB about your questions-<p>

WB: The Chaotix will have full control of the backstories after Knux 25 - starting with Mighty the Armadillo. Ray the Squirrel from Sonic Arcade will appear in Knux 26-28 to join the chaotix.<p>

Charmy will make a possible return in Knux 26, and afterwards it will most likely go Vector, then Espio, then Charmy, then Julie. With a possible Nack The Weasel connection on down the road.<p>

The chaotix as a whole will be taking part in the front stories as well depending upon space in stories. Vector and Charmy will play a role in the "First Date" storyline in Knux 26-28, with Espio also tagging along as well<p>

As for the Knux 24 snafu - Ken Penders admitted that in all honesty - The chaotix COMPLETELY got past past him. So call it a writers blunder. He apologized for it on the mailing lists and it editorially slipped by Justin gabrie as well. As for the ignoring of the Chaotix - that also should be no more of a problem past Knux 25.

<p><font color="red">

On your Q and A page, you said Starhedgehog had the SatAM episodes.  I can't even access his site though.  It's like it's non existant.  When I do get to his page, I can't open the movies section.  the only page I've found the SatAM episodes to work is Sonic Pandemonium, but he only has a few of them.  You may want to check into that and see if you can get them to work.

Star Hedgehog's Site does have problems once in a while, but usually works again before too long.

Can you help with sonic blast?I have been waiting for a level select code for it for a couple of years and have never found one.<br>

Also,when you link sonic1 to sonic& knuckles you get alot of special stages.now I got as far as level 97,174,780.The code for this level is 3871-3747-5203.  Now my question is do you have a code that will get me to an even higher level?<br>

Also I wanted to say I love this website and was wondering when the comics page would be updated.<p>

1. Sorry, no.  I've never seen that code anywhere, and neither has WB.<br>

2. Sorry, no.  I never even got close to that far before I had to stop.  Thanks for the code, though.  I'll put it up on the Game Info page when I get a chance.<br>

3.  WB: The comics page is being worked on and is coming along fine.  It wont be linked up until I work out the kinks, navigation, load times and such.<br>

Vector: Help out <a href="mailto:neoblackbat@hotmail.com">WB</a> and email him some suggestions for what you'd like to see on the comics info page.

Is there a way that I can purchase the Sonic Anime in English? If so, could I have access to that information? I can barely stand not having it. If there is no way to get it in English, is it possible to get it in Japanize?<br>

Thanks alot,<br>

<p></font>

The Sonic Anime (in English) is supposed to be available now.  Try a store that specializes in selling video tapes.  The Japanese version can be downloaded at starhedgehog.simplenet.com.<p>

Thanks to <a href="mailto:mightyray@earthlink.net">Ray</a> for telling me that someone he knows bought the Sonic Anime for $20 at a store called FYE (For Your Entertainment).  The tape is the same as the Japanese version, except, of course, for the translation.

How much would the Sonic Adventure music CD cost?

<p></font>

Thanks to <a href="mailto:mightyray@earthlink.net">Ray</a> for this info-<p>

<a href=http://www.gamemusic.com/>Game Music Online</a> has the "Songs With Attitude" CD for $28.95.  This is the CD with the character themes, not the "Sonic Adventure Remixes" CD.<p>

A 3rd collection of music, the "Sonic Adventure Original Soundtrack," is a 2-CD set with background music from SA, and it includes 69 tracks.  As far as we know, it's only available in Japan now, and we don't even know the Japanese price, so a price would be tough to estimate.

<font size="-1"><b>Why?</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

1.  Why was Ken going to kill off Sally in the End Game serries?  I

don't

understand what the whole deal was behind that but I'm glad she isn't

dead.<br>



2.  Someone on the news page, (Vector I think) spoke of SatAM at

Blockbuster.

Do they let you buy those or are they just for rental?<br>



3.  Will that poll Archie is having effect Sonic and Sally at all?  I

heard if

SEGA says no, they mean no no matter what.<br>



4.  Will Jon Benson and I get married?  <br>



5.  If Bunnie (my favorite Freedom Fighter) was de-robotosized, what

would her

strangth be in?  Meaning, how would she be able to help out.<br>



Soneec  

</font>

<p>1) Ken wanted to set up a story-line that would put the focus on Sonic after End Game, and Sally's the only thing in the way, but Sega pulled it off at the last moment.<br>

2) Rental only.<br>

3) It won't matter is Sega says no. It's all up to Sega, that's what everyone has to understand. People can flam Archie all they want, Sega's the one holding the strings.<br>

4) For everyone's info, we're not prophets...or psychics for that matter.<br>

5) Sally's maid...now there's a thought...

Becca-An here. I started to collect the knux comic from #18, and I think

its great!! problem is that i have to order them and so i can't get back

issues (boo hoo!) anyhoo, 1 where did Julie-Su become one of the

chaotix?

from what I've read she's part of the dark legon(???)    

2 who are the anchent walkers ? they keep gettin' mentiond.

i preadict that knux will be asking out julie-su very soon.how do i

know ?

ain't saying!!

</font>

<p>Julie-su was recommended by Locke to become a part of the Chaotix because Knuckles went on a trip with Athair. And yes, Julie was a part of the Dark Legion. The Ancient Walkers are three very powerful ancient beings that have mastered the energy of the chaos emeralds, they're like gods in a sence. And yes, Knuckles and Julie-sue are going to go out on a date in #26-#28, it's been in the news for oh...3 month now.

<font size="-1"><b>Questions...</b><br>

<p><font color="red">

ACK!!  It's me again!!  heheheh!  Another few weeks, another bundle of

questions that I need the answers to..heh heh..   Okies: 

<p>1) On my UPN station, they use to have Pokèmon on twice, 7 AM and 3 PM.  Now starting next

week,

it'll only be on 7AM, and 3 PM will be repleaced by two episodes of

"California Dreams" Could this be an effect of the placement of Sonic

Underground next month for the 3 PM schedule?<br>

2) When is the exact date of Sonic Underground?<br>

3) Will Sonia and Manic appear in the Archie comics, as well as Big and

E102-r

or whoever that robot is?<br>

4) What are the ages to the Downunda Freedom Fighters?<br>

5) If everyone says that Sally is too old for Tails to date, then why is he and Barby going out?<br>

6) Any chance of a Sonic/Mario crossover?<br>

7) What issues of Toon Disney did it have Sonic in?<br>

8) What made SEGA hate the SAT AM series of Sonic?<br>

9) How old is Amy Rose, according to SEGA?<br>

10) What month will Sabrina the Teenage Witch #28 with the Sonic crossover come out?<br>

11) IS there any chance that the Sonic crossover with Sabrina might also occur

in a TV episode of Sabrina?  Just a thought.<br>

<p>Thanks for yer time.<br>

SonicCats

</font>

<p>1) Maybe, maybe not.<br>

2) Don't know the exact date.<br>

3) Maybe in a independent comic, and Big and Gamma will appear in the comic in the near future.<br>

4) 14-16, between that. Archie never specified.<br>

5) They're going out? I was aware of that...last I checked, Tails is in Mobo wil Barby is in Downwanda.<br>

6) When hell freeze over...<br>

7) Eh...don't know the answer to this question.<br>

8) Everything that's not their's.<br>

9) Latest Sonic Adventure, a teen.<br>

10) 3 month from now.<br>

11) Maybe, but unlikely.

It's great that Sonic HQ is interviewing everybody they wanted to.  So

far,

all of them have been great.  However, there is one interview that never

happened due to no response.  Ben Hurst!  That's right!  It's been

almost two

months now that an interview was supposed to happen, but nobody posted

any

responses that he made.  Is it still planned?  Did anybody email him

since

February?  Well, when ever it happens, I'm looking foreword to it. 

Since he

did an interview with Sonic.alt or something like that back in

september, I

couldn't wait for what his response is about the Sonic Movie.  Anyway,

I want

to know did anybody forgot about the interview and is it still planned?<br>
