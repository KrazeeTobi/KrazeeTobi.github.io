<b>Chaos Emeralds</b>
<p><font color=red>Hi I want to know how many chaos emeralds there are? I heard there where 7 plus another emerald that Knuckles gaurds called the mega emerald could you please tell me if that is right? thanks  <p>Hi I just heard of an emerald called a super emerald. What in the world is a super emerald and how many are there? plus what are there're effects on sonic the hedgehog? thanks fan</font>
<p>We don't know how many Chaos Emeralds there are, but there seem to be multiple "sets" of 7, and occasionally 6 or 8.  Knuckles guards the Master Emerald, which is a huge emerald that keeps the Floating Island floating in the air.  There are also Super Emeralds, which seem to be regular emeralds that have grown larger due to their proximity to the Master Emerald.

<b>Dreamcast Pricing</b>
<p><font color=red>ok my name is Dr Ivo Robotnik. I would like to know how much the SEGA DREAMCAST consle would be next Christmas and where the cheapest places to buy them from.</font>
<p>Well, of course, we don't know that, but I would guess about $150.  There are probably some places online where you could get it slightly cheaper than in a store, or you could try a preowned games place like Funcoland.

<b>Sonic CD Metal Sonic Generators</b>
<p><font color=red>I have a question about the Sonic CD game: I know that destroying the Robot generators will create a good future in each zone, but what effect does destroying the Metal Sonic generators have?</font>
<p>As far as anyone knows, they cause the level in which you find a generator to be filled with animals.  I called Sega about this a few years ago, and one guy over there said something about fighting Metal Sonic in the Metallic Madness Zone (?!), but when I called another time, nobody knew what he was talking about.  I've gottn every Metal Sonic Generator in the game before, but nothing seemed to change in the game except that all the levels had animals in them.

<b>Sonic Adventure Lyrics</b>
<p><font color=red>Hi!  Recently I listened to the character songs for Sonic Adventure.  I really like the music, but due to bad sound quality on my own computer I can't always understand what is  being said.  I was wondering if you could tell me where I can find the lyrics to the songs.  I would really apprectiate it!  Also, while I'm writing this, I feel inclined to tell you how much I love your site!  You probably recieve hundreds of these usless compliments... but oh well.  ^_^  One more thing:  Does this ever get annoying?  I mean you poor people, sitting there answering tons of pointless questions.  ^_^  Well, have fun!  And thanks!<p>-Dark</font>
<p>The lyrics are available on the music page.  <p>Thanks for saying you like the site. :)  It is nice to hear.  And yes, it can get a little annoying sometimes.  Thanks for understanding ^_^.
