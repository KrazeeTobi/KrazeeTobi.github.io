The familiar protagonist. His speed is the highest amongst all of the characters.<br>
However, the acceleration and grip performance are inferior, so practice is required.<br>
He can curl up and spin-dash to achieve even greater speed.<br>
He can also jump twice, so he can jump over large obstacles such as rivers.<br>

The only female character.<br>
She participates in races in an all-purpose car that Tails had modified for her.<br>

Strategies</b><br>
The Turbo Dash is required at the start.<Br>

A robot by Robotnik with the goal of becoming the strongest one, even surpassing Metal Sonic.<br>
