 After a recurring battle to the death with Dr. Robotnik, Sonic and Tails (who adores him) continue their adventurous journey together.<br>
During their journey, they see a commercial on the giant screen of a building that says "Calling all contestants for the World Grand Prix!".<p>
"Sonic, Sonic! It's a race to see who's the fastest in the world!"<br>
 Tails was very interested.<br>
"Hey, Sonic, let's enter the competition. You're going to win! I want to see what you're made of."<br>
"Racing...not really interested."<br>
Sonic wasn't too keen on the idea.<p>
Just as he was about to leave, his eyes were glued to the switching screen.<br>
Then, suddenly, "Tails, I'm in!". As soon as he announces this, Sonic runs off.<br>
"Wait, Sonic!". Tails hurried after him.<p>
 Sonic's eyes were glued to the screen which read: "List of Scheduled Players: Dr. Robotnik".<br>

Sonic wasn't the only one who saw this video that was broadcast around the world.<br>
The news of the race had reached Knuckles, Sonic's good rival, and Amy, the girl in love with Sonic.<p>
"Sonic, this World Grand Prix is where I'm going to settle a score with you!"<br>
"I'm sure Sonic will be participating in this race. Please wait for, Sonic!"<br>

 Someone had been scouting the whole thing using a spy satellite.<br>
His name is Dr. Robotnik. He is an evil super-genius scientist who has challenged Sonic to battle many times before.<p>
"Hahhhhh... Sonic, you've fallen right into the trap."<br>
"I've already investigated the fact that the Chaos Emeralds are lying somewhere in the area where these races are held."<br>
"If Sonic and his friends happen to find the Chaos Emeralds during the race, they won't have to search for them. They'll take it all away at once."<br>
Dr. Robotnik turns around and says: "Even if Sonic is in the middle of a race, if you attack him while he's in the middle of a race,<br>
you'll be in trouble..."<br>
As I looked at them, I saw a line of several figured in the dim darkness, their eyes glowing eerily.<p>
"Hahhhh... I believe I have the perfect plan... At last, the time has come for me to achieve my long-held dream of world domination... Hahhhhhhahahaha..."<br>

 Will Sonic be able to stop Dr. Robotnik's ambitions? And where will the World Grand Prix go?<p>
Now, it's time for the World Grand Prix to begin!<br>
