      Yes! This is the sector where you can find out about Sally's Wonderful World(s)
      of Sonic the Hedgehog. Stories are written under the universe of Sonic, but
      almost every story after <I>The Beginning&nbsp;of&nbsp;Sally&nbsp;Moon</I>
      has to do with Sally Moon. Don't worry, I made&nbsp;sure&nbsp;the
      stories&nbsp;were real&nbsp;good. (So
      shame&nbsp;on&nbsp;you&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;despise Sally&nbsp;Moon :P)

	  <I>Robotisized</I>- In
	  <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/shay941/robotisized1.txt">Part 1</A>, while
	  many around Mobius celebrate victory over the defeat of Robotnik's reign,
	  many do not realize the danger that lays ahead, such as the fact that Snively
	  is alive and well and has a lackey of metallic proportions. When Sonic and
	  the Gang go for cleanup of the ruins of Robotropolis, the Gang finds half
	  the city rebuilt. Strange&nbsp;things&nbsp;start to happen when Sonic starts
	  acting peculiar in the city. And what's up with Sir Charles?&nbsp;Could it
	  be Snively and his mysterious new assistant? &nbsp;Rated PG. Next, in
	  <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/s0nlcteam/robotisized2.txt">Part 2</A>, General
	  Cor of the Combot army locates and attacks Knothole by means to capture Sonic.
	  This is by then Sonic is forced to make the hardest decision ever, but, by
	  unknown means of gaining an ally for the freedom fighters. Rated PG for slight
	  profanity and moderate violence.

	  <I><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/saiiymoon/tbosmoon.txt">The Beginning
	  of Sally Moon</A>-</I> Originally going to be called "Elders", the storyline
	  was changed. When Sally is invited by Bunnie to go to a bazaar at Sunrise
	  Resort, she decides to see what this is all about. Upon reaching the village,
	  Sally is unexpectfully greeted by an old friend. After clearing up a
	  misunderstanding, the gang attends the city banquet for that night. But things
	  take a turn for the worse when Sunrise Resort is attacked by a powerful monster.
	  Wait till the&nbsp;new heroine shows up.

      <P>
      This story is the remake of "The Beginning of Sally Moon". The orginal was
      so poorly done because I actually put more into it until it got erased (oh
      no!) and left me with 1 hour's work lost. So imagine this as the "Director's
      Cut" of "The Beginning of Sally Moon". Enjoy!
      <P>

      Saga #2 </I><U>Zone Wars: A Tale of Two Hedgehogs, Part 1- "The Underground
      Experience"</U></A></B>
      <P>
      Sonic, reunited with Sally once more, has been designated partners with her
      as "Starlight Knight", a dashing, sword swinging, star spinning, quill throwing
      hero, and with Sally as the beautifil warrior girl "Sally Moon". High Scool
      life can be tough for both of them, especially now that she and her friends
      are now being taught inside the palace walls. But not all things are to last.
      When Zone Prime reports to the couple that a new disturbance is being monitored
      along the "Underground Zone", it is up to Sonic and Sally to investigate,
      along with Tails, Bunnie, Antoine, Metalla, Uncle Chuck, as well as Zonic,
      the Zone Cop. Not all zones are what they expect, especially the Underground
      Zone. Who are the mysterious beings that entered their zone, Mobius Prime?
      And do they work for the new mysterious villian?

      When we last left off, Sonic, Sally and Tails, along with thier new friends
      Shay, Gryph, and Daniel were captured in the hands of....Robotnik?! What
      a world! But Tails escapes and calls on for help. But who's the mysterious
      stranger coming to resue the rescue party? And what happens when Sonic Prime
      meets Sonic Underground? And what happens when more than one family is reunited?
      The Result? A dream come true when the Sonic Underground meets Queen Aleena
      of Mobius Underground face-to-face.</TD>
