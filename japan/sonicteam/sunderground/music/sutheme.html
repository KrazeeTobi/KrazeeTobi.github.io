In a far off land, the throne awaits,
<P ALIGN=Left>
A seer warns of a deadly fate,
<P ALIGN=Left>
Give up your struggle, separate,
<P ALIGN=Left>
Bide your time, lie in wait.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Sonic Underground!! Sonic Underground!!
<P ALIGN=Left>
They made a vow their mother will be found!
<P ALIGN=Left>
The children grow, learn what's right,
<P ALIGN=Left>
Leaders of the freedom fight,
<P ALIGN=Left>
They seek their mother, she knows they do
<P ALIGN=Left>
Is it time? If she only knew!
<P ALIGN=Left>
Will the prophecy come true?
<P ALIGN=Left>
Sonic Underground!! Sonic Underground!!
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I long for my children, but I have to wait,</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>To act too soon could seal their fate.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
They made a vow their mother will be found!!!
<P ALIGN=Left>
SONIC UNDERGROUND!!!
