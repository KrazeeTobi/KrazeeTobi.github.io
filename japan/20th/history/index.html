    <div class="contensSubstance">
    	<p class="imgLeft"><img src="image/01_01.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="280" >In 1988, Sega released the Mega Drive, a home video game console that incorporated the latest technology of the time.
    		SEGA launched a project to create a game that would strongly appeal to the performance of the Mega Drive and an original and attractive character that would become the "face" of SEGA.</p>
    	<p class="imgLeft"> The project was a difficult one, but after combining a functional design to realize the game's concept of "unprecedented speed" with cartoon-like artwork that would be accepted worldwide, we finally came up with a character that embodies SEGA, with a color scheme based on "blue and white" that travels around the world at the speed of sound.
    		That's what "Sonic the Hedgehog" is all about.</p>
    	<p class="imgLeft"> Then, on June 23, 1991. Sonic the Hedgehog", the first great adventure of Sonic the Hedgehog,
    		was released in North America first, named after him. Sonic the Hedgehog became a huge hit, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, thanks to its dramatic speed and cool protagonist, Sonic.</p>
	<div class="floatRight"><img src="image/01_02.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" >
	<p class="txtCaution txtCenter">"Sonic the Hedgehog 2"</p></div>
	<p>In Japan, "UFO Catcher," which was sold mainly in game centers, was made into a Sonic version, and Sonic goods were sold as prizes, and the BGM for "UFO Catcher" was the same as that used in the Sonic games.
	<p class="imgRight"> Sonic has become a popular image character for Sega, both in home video games and in amusement facilities such as game centers.
	<p class="imgRight"> After that, sequels such as "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" and "Sonic the Hedgehog CD" were released one after another and became hits. The "Sonic the Hedgehog" series was also released on the Sega Game Gear, a handheld game console (it was colored at the time!), and the popularity of Sonic continued to grow.
		In this way, Sonic became widely recognized as the "face of Sega" and continued to play an active role in the company.

    	<p class="imgLeft"><img src="image/02_01.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="275" >Sonic's been very active on platforms other than the Mega Drive and Game Gear!<br>
    		The stage for Sonic's activities is endless, including the Mega Drive's "Super 32X" expansion device, the "Kid's Computer Pico" released by Sega Toys, and arcade titles developed in game centers.</p>
    	<p class="imgLeft"> In addition to video games, the Sega-sponsored F1 cars appeared on the helmets of the racers and the uniforms of the J-League players. In addition, a wide variety of character goods were released to the general public, including stationery, clothing, and food and drink.</p>
    	<p class="imgLeft"> One of the best examples of this is the "Sonic's Happy Meal" campaign in collaboration with McDonald's in the US. As soon as the campaign started, 40 million Happy Meals were sold out before the campaign was over. 40 million is the equivalent of one Happy Meal for every child in the US! The number of 40 million had already created a buzz in the industry, but it was gone in an instant. It is not hard to imagine the surprise of those involved. The popularity of the product was also proven by the fact that it was ranked third in the Q Score survey of American children, behind only Hollywood stars and athletes, showing its immense popularity among children throughout the United States.</p>
    	<p class="imgLeft"> In addition, Sonic the Hedgehog was the first video game to be preserved in the National Film and Television Archive, the UK's national repository for historical films and valuable programs from around the world. </p>

    	<p class="imgRight"> "Sonic Jam" contained four of the most popular titles from the Mega Drive series. In addition, there was a "Sonic World" section where you could view various materials about Sonic. In this section, the 2D Sonic, who had been drawn with dots until now, appeared as a 3D polygonal character for the first time to introduce each game.</p>
    	<p class="imgRight"> In the following racing game, "Sonic R", Sonic and his friends finally appeared in a world where everything was in 3D! Along with other familiar characters, Sonic ran around the three-dimensional game world. </p>

    	<p class="imgLeft"><img src="image/06_01.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="255" >For current home consoles, "Sonic the Hedgehog" was released in 2006 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The theme of this game was to commemorate Sonic's 15th anniversary that year, and to return to his roots.</p>
    	<p class="imgLeft"> Also for the Wii, "Sonic and the Secret Rings" and "Sonic and the Dark Knight" were released as action games with a new play style using the Wii Remote. In addition, "Sonic Free Riders" was released exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect, which is controlled by the body.<br class="clear" ></p>

    	<p>Sonic's mainstream "high-speed 3D action game" series has also evolved into a more sophisticated and playable form with "Sonic World Adventure" and "Sonic Colors". I'm sure that many of you have already played them.</p>
    	<p>In the past few years, Sonic has also crossed the boundaries of manufacturers and has collaborated with other companies on games such as "Mario & Sonic at the Beijing Olympics" and "Super Smash Brothers X". Sonic, who started out as a mascot character for Sega, now transcends the boundaries between countries, genres, game hardware, and manufacturers, and just as his character says, "I'm free to go wherever I want to go without being bound by anything." </p>
