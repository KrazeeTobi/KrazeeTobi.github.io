                <br>
                He loves to live a free and easy life, and has a bit of an attitude. He has a kind heart and won't leave anyone in need alone. His controls are well-balanced, and we recommend it for beginners and pros alike.</font></font>

                Sonic's sidekick, a little fox.<br>
                <br>
                He has a gentle personality and is a big fan of mechanics. Tails' greatest trait is his ability to fly by spinning his two tails, which is also the origin of his nickname. By flying through the air, you can easily explore the zones. Tails is sure to be able to find the Special Spring in even the most obscure of places.</font></td>

                <br>
                He's a powerful echidna that can shatter boulders with a single blow. He has a single-minded and serious personality. Knuckles' greatest abilities is that he can glide and climb walls. Thanks to these abilities, he has a wider range of movement than Sonic. This makes him a good character for exploring maps.</font></td>

                In order to do so, he has turned innocent animals into diabolical badniks using his scientific skills. He's not very good at physical combat, so he rides on his own machines.</font></td>
