On the 30th, we flew to Guatemala by plane. Our first stop was the Tikal Ruins in the jungle.<p>

Shortly after entering the jungle, there is a lodge that looks like a campground, and we start from there and move on foot.<br>

On the way, we went along a kind of animal path. Giant ants form under rivers under our feet, and tarantula nests sometimes make holes in the ground.

Wild animals also showed their faces. Monkeys were fighting in the trees overhead, stretching to the sky, and peacocks were walking around.

<p>

Å@When we climbed the main staircase to the top, which is unique to Mayan temples, we looked down and saw that the stairs we had just climbed continued far down like a precipice.<br>

When we finally reached the top, the view was blocked by trees. After climbing on top of the stone roof of the temple,  the group saw a sea of trees stretching to the horizone.

The only sounds coming from this vast space of nothing but nature were the howling monkeys and the cries of the birds and their echoes.

<p>

The next day, December 1st, we drove to the Washaktun Ruins. The 4WD drove through the muddy and bumpy road. The mud looked like a swamp.<br>

As we gazed at the pyramid of Washactun, which had a different style from the previous ones, we recalled the history of the Maya.

<p>

On the second day, we visited the other temples in Tulum that we hadn't been able to visit the day before yesterday.<br>

We spent the next three days travelling and resting, and arrived in Lima on the morning of the 4th. Our destination was the famous ground paintings of Nazca.<br>

In direct contrast to the jungles that had covered the world on the road so far, the scene was filled with deserts as far as the eye could see.<p>

Speaking of Peru, we had heard that it was one of the places where Spielberg and Lucas filmed Indiana Jones.

But the journey itself, through jungle, Caribbean, and desert, is truly an Indiana Jones adventure story.<br>

As the small tourist Cessna passed through the city, the landscape below us was nothing but sand.<br>

The six of us had seen many ruins that were too large to fit in our own vision, but this ground painting was probably the largest of them all.

In the middle of nowhere, there was a painting that was too huge.<br>

A feeling of "Oh, we've finally come this far" oozed from everyone's heart.
