After listening to the album, Mr. Oshima couldn't help but send out an email to the sound team, Mr. Hataya.<p>

Address: Tokyo, Japan

It's been a long time since I sent out an email.



I was listening to Sonic Team PowerPlay with nostalgia.

I listened to Sweet Mix in Holy Night and was so impressed that I decided to write an email.



It's great! Hattaya World, a remix that sticks in your mind.

And it's so cool!



May we work together again someday! During the heart-wrenching PJ.
