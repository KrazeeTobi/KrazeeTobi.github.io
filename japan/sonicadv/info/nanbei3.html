On the 5th, we headed to Cusco, a city located in the high mountains.<br>

Cusco was once the capital of the Inca Empire, and even after its demise, people continue to live here.

We felt like we were in a basin at an altitude of 3400 meters with people and houses crowded together.

<p>

On the 6th, we went to Machu Picchu, a fortified city hidden in the high mountains. It is said that Hayao Miyazaki once visited this place.<br>

The stone houses below us appear and disappear in the clouds. The rain falls on and off. The mountains are gith there, but hazy.<br>

Indeed, the beautiful aerial city spreading out below us reminded us of the legendary Laputa, the hanging garden city.

<p>

December 7. We headed to our final destination, Pachacama. We are released from the thin air of the high mountains.<br>

As we took the bus down the mountains, the desert began to spread out. There was nothing to hide around us. We could see it clearly even from a distance.<br>

The Pachacama Temple is like a maze with many very narrow passages.

The ochre-colored ruins on the hill were in a tremendous gale. As we climbed to the top of the building, we could see the Pacific Ocean stretching far to the west.

<p>

Thus, the six of us, exhausted both physically and mentally, finished our two-week trip to all the destinations.<br>

All that was left was another 30-hour flight home.

<p>

The various places we visited this time can be summed up in one word, "ruins", but each was full of its own unique character and charm.<br>

The six of us were able to experience the weight and presence of history, a precious experience that only those who have been there can experience, and the beauty that was burned into our eyes.

<p>

Å@Twenty months have already passed since this trip. How has their inspiration been stimulated by the trip?<br>

it has remained a mystery until now. But we will soon find out.<br>

In Sonic Adventure...

<p>

The end.
