On the 26th, we flew from Narita Airport to Cancun, Mexico via Dallas Airport in the US.

<p>

On the 27th, we drove off before we had time to get used to the jet lag. The first site we visited was the Chichen Itza Ruins, the largest Mayan ruins in Mexico.<br>

Carvings of snakes as gods, pyramids peeking out in various places, murals carved into pillars and walls, crumbling towers and stone pillars, plants, and trees growing between buildings, and narrow passageways.<br>

All the various materials that must appear in an adventure are here.

The view from the stone pyramid Castillo made us very aware that we were in a land far away from Japan.

<p>

On the 28th, we headed to the Tulum Ruins. Tulum is located directly on the Caribbean Sea.<br>

The unfamiliar coupling of sea and ruins was a completely unexpected image. A series of stone walls beyond a wide wasteland of bushes.

From the direction of what seemsed to be the ocean, the scent of the sea and the tropical breeze blew strongly and constantly.

Through a small entrance with a stone wall, you can see stone houses sprawled across a well-kept green lawn.

A huge temple towers of the cliffs that overhang the sea. It is surrounded by coral reefs and protected by the beautiful Caribbean sea.<br>

The contrast between the perfect reality and the fantastic blue and green was shocking enough to wipe out my previous image of the ruins.

<p>

29th. We took a boat to the San Herbacio Ruins on Cozumel Island. Ruins floating on a southern island is just like the situation in Sonic 3!
