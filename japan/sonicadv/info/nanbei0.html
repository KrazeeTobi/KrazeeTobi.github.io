<hr>

<br>

Autumn, 1996. About half a year has passed since the development of NiGHTS ended.<br>

The members of Sonic Team were about to begin work on a new project.<br>

That work is a completely new version of Sonic.<p>



At the start of the development, the six core members of the team went overseas for research to develop the concept of the software. The destination was Central and South America.<br>

We needed to see the many ancient ruins in Central and South America with our own eyes, not through TV or books.<p>

This is the world in which Sonic takes place. It begins on a sunny southern island, followed by a neon-lit casino town and ancient ruins hidden in the jungle.<br>

The Casino Night Zone in Sonic 2 was a masterpiece, filled with pinball and slow machine gadgets.<br>

This is because we have a wealth of experience from our trip to Las Vegas for the development of Sonic 2. Seeing is believing.<br>

There is nothing more useful than experience gained by oneself. An ancient ruin that you have not yet seen with your own eyes may become a new place to create new ideas.<p>



Plans for the trip were quickly made, and the trip was put into action in November. There were two main destinations.<br>

First, there was the Mayan ruins scattered in the tropical forests of Central America. Then there are the Incas of South America.<br>

This was the first time for all of us, including those inside, to go on such a large scale reporting trip.<p>
