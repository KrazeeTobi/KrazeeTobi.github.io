<b>01.  DREAMS DREAMS ( Kids ver. )</b><br>

You know, the ending theme to NiGHTS!

This version was well received but was not included in the soundtrack.

Finally, it's on CD.

<tr><td>

<b>02.  DREAMS DREAMSÅiA-Cappella verÅDÅj</b><br>

An acappella version of Dreams Dreams from Christmas NiGHTS.<br>

It's a bit like a grown-up Christmas, isn't it?

This is a moody version to listen to with your partner.

<b>03.  Super Sonic Racing</b><br>

SEGA EUROPE's sound creator Richard wrote all the music for Sonic R,

and this is the song that tops the list!

Everybody's Super Sonic Racing !!<p>



<b>04.  Can You Feel The Sunshine</b><br>

Anyway, Sonic R has a lot of melodious

songs, and this is one of them!

The melodies and rhythms will have you

humming along before you know it!<p>



<b>05.  Number One</b><br>

Sonic R's ending song!

A much calmer shuffle beat than the previous two songs!

It's too cool!

Number One, indeed!

<tr><td bgcolor="#eeeeee" align="center"><b>[BURNING RANGERS]</b></tr>

<tr><td>

<b>06.  Burning Hearts -ANGEL of Flame-</b><br>

This is the theme song of the same title, sung passionately and enthusiastically by Mitsuyoshi of Sega.

It's included in Sega Kara!

I hope you all remember it and sing it.<p>



<b>07.  We are Burning Rangers</b><br>

An insert song that was used in the demo screen and shooting aspect of the game.

Marlon Sanders, who sang on the acappella version of Dreams Dreams is on vocals.

Burning Ranger is Omar Hakim's drumming in all the vocal songs.

You can hear his hot playing especially in this song.<p>



<b>08.  I just smile</b><br>

The ending theme of the same song. The lyrics and vocals were written by Tomoko Sasaki of NiGHTS fame.

The song has a delicate feel that fits the atmosphere of the character Ilia.

It is a heart-wrenching mid-ballad.

<b>09.  Sonic: You Can Do Anything</b><br>

The theme song for the opening movie of the MEGA CD version of Sonic CD,

 released in 1993. It was sung by Keiko Utoku.

It is a pop number with a sense of speed that matches the movie of Sonic running around.<p>



<b>10.  Cosmic Eternity: Believe in Yourself</b><br>



The ending theme of the same song. This is also sung by Utoku.

Both the opening and ending theme are lyrics and RAP by forumer SHOGUN guitarist Casey Rankin.

It is written with a positive and powerful theme.

<tr><td>

<b>11.  DREAMS DREAMS Å` Sweet mix in holy night</b><br>

This is a reggae version of Dreams Dreams that was made

as a gift for the NiGHTSound section of the Sonic Team website.

It's a sweet song with many of the sounds used in NiGHTS and Christmas NiGHTS sprinkled throughout.

Let's listen to it this Christmas and get excited.
