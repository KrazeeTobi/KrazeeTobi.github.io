Sorry for the delay. It's finally done!

<br>

We've finally managed to get it released. We're very proud of it, so please pick it up and play it.

<p>

In this announcement, we'd like to tell you that there is more to Sonic Adventure than just the main story.

<p>

Sonic Adventure also includes an internet browser, and there are some sites that can only be viewed through this browser.

We have a site for you that you can't visit.<br>

This means that there is a website that only people who have purchased Sonic Adventure can enjoy.

<p>

We're planning to expand the game world here with various tricks.<br>

It's still a secret, but we're sure it'll be a lot of fun!<br>

I guess we'll just have to try it first!

<p>

So, the first item is a Christmas-only downloadable item.<br>

Let's decorate a Christmas tree at Station Square!<br>

Let's start with something like this. Are you ready for a new visual memory?

<p>

As the name suggests, this is an item to decorate a Christmas tree in Station Square,

the first place you stop by when you start the game.<br>

Of course, it's not just a decoration, but a little trick...<br>

Whoa, from here on out, you'll have to actually download and experience it for yourself!

<p>

Now, once you've bought Sonic Adventure, connect it to the Internet and explore the new possibilites!<br>
