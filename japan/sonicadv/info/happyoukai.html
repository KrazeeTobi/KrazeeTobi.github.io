  It's been four years since Sonic & Knuckles. As the first software title on the Dreamcast, we are pleased to announce the latest Sonic game. This time, we would like to invite all the people who have always supported us the most since our first unveiling.<br>

I hope you will be able to be there to witness this presentation.

  It's great to announce hardware, but without software, it's just a box. What about Sega's software? The reason why I've kept my mouth shut until today, despite everyone's suggestions, is because I wanted to share this presentation with everyone.<br>

I've seen it and all I can say is, "Great! I saw it." You too can participate in the presentation and be a witness to history!

<b><b>Takezaki</b></b>: It's finally time to announce the first Dreamcast software from Sonic Team.

It's been four years since the last new Sonic game created by the original Sonic Team, Sonic and Knuckles

for the Mega Drive, which was released in 1994, wasn't it, Mr. Naka?<br>

<b>Naka</b>: Yes. We've been getting a lot of requests from our fans for a new Sonic game.

The time has finally come for us to respond to their requests.<br>

<b>Takezaki</b>: I believe Sonic Team just released Burning Rangers in February of this year.

When did you start development on Sonic Adventure?

<b>Naka</b>: In fact, we started thinking about this new title right after the development of NiGHTS

for the Saturn ended.<br>As we incorporated various ideas that we wanted to do such and such a thing if

we were going to do a Sonic game, it gradually became a large scale work.

In order to realize these ideas, we decided to develop the game on the Dreamcast.<p>

<b>Takezaki</b>: What kind of game will the next Sonic be?<p>

<b>Naka</b>: I'm confident that the new Sonic will be able to show the future standard of gaming that has never been seen before.

However, since we're having a presentation, I can't tell you any more about it today.

I can't tell you much more today (laughs). (laughs) If I talk too much about the contents,

the presentation on August 22 will be meaningless.<p>



<b>Takezaki</b>: That's true. (laughs)<br>

	So, can you tell us about the presentation?<p>

<b>Naka</b>: Yes. The presentation will be held on Saturday, August 22nd, at Tokyo International orum Hall A in Yurakucho.

Since we have been given the opportunity to present Sonic, we wanted to make sure that the fans who are always the most enthusiastic supporters

would be there. We've decided to make the event open to everyone, even those who are not members of the press

or related parties.<br>

We're planning to have two showsm but we're thinking of having only the fans participate the first one,

and the people involved in the second one.

And Sega partners.

The staff and I are hoping to have a system that will give priority

to those who are interested in the event.<p>

<b>Takezaki</b>: Speaking of the Tokyo International Forum, it is very convenient for transportation near the station.

It's just one stop away from Tokyo Station over at Yurakucho Station, so it is easy to find for those who

come to Tokyo during their summer vacation.<p>

<b>Naka</b>: Yes, the date of August 22 was also decided in view of the fact that it was a Saturday during the summer vacation.

It would have been better if it was a little later so that people could have a close look at the finished product,

but the following weekend would be the last week of the summer vacation, and everyone would have been busy

catching up on their homework.

<b>Takezaki</b>: What will the presentation be like?<p>

<b>Naka</b>: We are in the process of discussing the content with many staff members to make it as good as possible

so as not to betray the expectations of those who have come.

We are also currently considering a variety of souvenirs to give to visitors as a memento of their visit.

Stay tuned.<p>

<b>Takezaki</b>: I think it will be crowded on the day of the vent, but do I

need to make a reservation for the tickets?

<b>Naka</b>: In order to make it easy for anyone to come and visit us, we do not take advance reservations.

The Tokyo International Forum is a venue that can hold 5,000 people at a time,

so 10,000 people can come in total, right? I wonder if that many people will come... (laughs)<br>

But if by any chance the first session is full, we will give the

second ticket to the person in line after that.

This is a free-to-attend event, so we don't know how many people will actually show up.

However, I will do my best to be as kind as possible to those who do come.

I will also do my best to prepare for the event on August 22.<p>



<b>Takezaki</b>: You're looking forward to August 22nd now, aren't you?<br>

I'm sure Mr. Naka will be on stage and I'll be hanging around the lobby. (laughs)

Lastly, please give a message to the people.<p>

<b>Naka</b>: I am sure that everyone from small children to the fans who have

supported Sonic up to now will be satisfied with the presentation.<br>We hope you look forward to seeing the new Sonic

rebirth on the Dreamcast.

See you at the Tokyo International Forum on August 22.<p>



...I don't want to get up on stage. (laughs)
