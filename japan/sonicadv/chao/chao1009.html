        Chao have a tendency to take the skills and physical characteristics of other animals and transform into their own form, so their appearance, personality, and behavior are truly unique.</font>

      <td colspan=2> <font size="2">NiGHTS' A-LIFE has been focused on breeding and change, but this time, A-LIFE Chao aims to go further. The new A-LIFE Chao aims to realize two-way communication with the player character.<br>
        For example, if they like you enough, they will bring you items and rub up against you.<br>
        On the other hand, if you are mean to them, you will be abandoned or ignored.<br>
        In other words, not only does the player do something to A-LIFE, but A-LIFE approaches the player as if it were a living creature with a real will.<br>
        This is the most important feature of this A-LIFE Chao.</font></td>
