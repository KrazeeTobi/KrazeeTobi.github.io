Sonic Adventure has two types of areas. Speedy action stages, adventure fields to savor.

In this issue, we'll be showing off screenshots of Station Square, an adventure field that's never been shown in shows before!

Station Square is a modern city with a train station at its center.<br>

Trains to the Mystic Ruins depart from the station, and the sea spreads out in the surrounding area.

The station is adjacent to a resort hotel, and you can take an elevator to the Chao Garden.<br>

As befits a modern city, skyscrapers and the all-weather theme park Twinkle Park towers above the city, 

and there is a shopping district near City Hall, and at night, you can go to the casino area.<br>

Chao eggs are displayed in the windows of shopping malls. In a big city full of people,

communication with the residents is one of the pleasures.<br>

Find the entrance to an action stage and discover hidden items! Also, several boss battles will take place here.<br>

It looks different in the evening and at night.
