Okay, here my attempt at a Sonic story.. If you feel like flaming me.. go=
 ahead!
I like to set my moron-mailer onto some poor <FEMALE_DOG>'s address.

____________________________________________________________________________=

Hiya all! Another Sonic story!  [JOY!] Though I would like to say that from
my point of view this story moves too quickly... but.. maybe you will enjoy
it.
____________________________________________________________________________=

If you want to swap mindless information, send me hate mail, give me Sonic's
DNA strings (Or even yours?) Email me at: ablater@lin01.global.co.za

Please note: I actually *RESPOND* to mail, unlike *some* people..
[In other words I'm pleading for feed back]
____________________________________________________________________________=

This story was designed with the least possible added characters,
[Oh sure, it has Bookshire or Packbell], but unlike some stories I've
seen, it doesn't:

    #) Alter the storyline from there on.
    #) Add characters that represent the writer. [Becoming hero's of=
 course!]
    #) Forget about Sonic and focus on some other hero. [Who steals the=
 show]
    #) Have any mega-depressing parts. [That force me to meditate!]
    #) Have any ninja's.  [PHEWW!]
    #) Exceed 80 Chars on the X-axis. [Ahahahha!]

Though personally I prefer my "RL10-Tortured Freedom" Story to this.

But...

Onward:

                     "Cold Deceptions" By Simon Howes

Robotnik grinned evily as he saw the blue blaze on his monitor heading for
the factory, yes, the hedgehog was right on time. It seemed to him
that the freedom fighters never missed a chance to strike, and today it=
 would
be to his advantage.

A week previously a freedom fighter doomed for the robotocizer had=
 heroically
escaped, and in his departure taken a CD containing important information
concerning the plastic factory.
At the time the overlord had nearly exploded with rage, but just before he
could reach his critical point, his android had stopped him with some more
of his digital ingenius.

As a result of this, the factory had now been reconfigured, and though from
the outside it could still be seen spewing out smoke like it always had,
on the inside there were some drastic modifications in production. For one
thing, the casting machines had been replaced with squadrons of swat-bots,
the security had taken a swing for the increase. There were at least a
hundred and fifty laser turrets, and to crown it all, the central fluid
conduit--the weakest area, the area where a single charge of explosive could
take the whole factory up from, had been removed and replaced with a
welcoming team.

Princess Sally looked nervously at her communicator, waiting for a reply
from Sonic. Time seemed to drag on eternally, until finally it popped with
Sonic's voice.

"Okay Sal, I'm there, nothing seems to be hapnin', I'm going in!"
She paused for a moment, "Okay, but be carefull!"

With that the connection seized, and she was left alone again, lost in the
evening-light of a former capitol city. Light that once would have been
safe to walk in, light that was now dominated by cold-metallic-evil and
enslaved-former-organics.

She found herself staring into the heart of the city where the factory was,
past the broken and war-torn buildings, past the dumps of a former garden
city. Her soul cried out wanting to be with him, voices inside her told her
that something wasn't right.
She hesitated, in the sky she could see a hover-unit heading for the=
 factory.
"Sonic!" she screamed over the radio, "it's a trap, get out of there!"

She never heard his reply, as a cold-robotic hand savagely hoisted her up=
 from
behind. In the process her communicator fell to the ground and crumbled as
the robot stepped on it.

The machine carried her for a few blocks before coming to a hover unit, it
then stood idly in front of a swat-bot for about half a minute, seemingly
transferring data or awaiting orders.
Eventually the unit reacted, fetching a restrainer out of the hover-unit
and latching it over her--pinning her arms firmly to her side. The swat-bot
then took custody of her and headed the hover-unit for the Robotropolis
command centre.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-

Inside, another swat-bot took her up to Robotnik's control room, the droid
stopped at the doorway, giving her a moment to witness Robotniks fury.

He continued on, apparently not aware of her presence, yelling, slamming his
hands on control panels, screaming curses on hedgehogs. Tried to pull his
hair, but found out that he didn't have any.
"Damn you hedgehog! Damn YOU!! One day you will be mine! You and all your
little friends! One day! ONE DAY!   ONE DAAAYY!!"
With that he swung around ready to strike the nearest thing, when an image
terminated his task in mid-action.

His facial expressions morphed from those of despair, anguish, frustration
and anger to an alarming grin.
"Well.. well.." he clasped his hands together, "what have we here?"
The princess struggled.
He smiled even more, "there is no need to resist, you cannot escape.."
"You'll never get away with this!"

Packbell came to the door that moment, and shared in his makers amusement,
and added to the chat. "So is that where they get the expression from?"
Again Robotnik chuckled, then pointing to the restrainer with a motion,
the swat-bot handed her to Packbell, who removed the device and continued
to hold her firmly.
With another motion, the swat-bots left the room. The door hissed shut.

The overlord faced away, paced the room for a moment, then came back to face
the princess up close.
"If there was one wish that I could have, I would wish I could let you and
your friends all see each other suffer.. but.. however.. it seems that,
you alone will have to do for now..."
He grinned evily immersing Sally in bad breath, masquerading the versatility
of the 'Mobian-common-cold' to polymorph across species.

Packbell headed for the door, it would be good to robotocize this trouble
maker and get her out of the way for good he thought to himself.
A digital flicker from what manifested as his sub-concious mind stopped him
in his tracks. He turned to face Ivo, satisfaction in his voice, "perhaps
there is a way.. perhaps there is.."
"What?" Robotnik stared confused.
"Perhaps before we robotocize this.." he lifted the squirrel slightly, "I
could have a private word with you.."

Sonic arrived back at Knothole, to have his frantic questions answered by
even more frantic questions.
No one had seen her!

He quivered, they had her! They HAD HER! THEY HAD HER!

All at once he found himself racing forward towards Robotropolis, but in
his state of being governed by anger and fear, and loss of energy from
his escape, bad perception resulted in him colliding into a tree not
meters away from Bunny.

When she got to him, he was out cold.

Princess Sally's heart went static as the glass cylinder closed over her,
shielding Robotnik from her comments, locking her in with her thoughts. This
was the end she thought to herself between the humming pulses of the
machine, she felt faint..

Outside a swat-bot held a camera, catching every moment of
Robotniks glory. Ivo spoke to the camera for a long time, pointing to her,
pointing at the machinery, the cylinder, and then finally clutching his
Robotic arm.

Packbell pressed a button; the humming inside the glass cylinder siezed;
was replaced by a yellow beam engulfing the young princess's vision.
All at once a thousand thoughts overflowed her mind, fear, pain, struggling,
futility and chaos. A cold chill ran down her spine, her head felt mildy=
 warm.

The chaos caused her to become intolerably dizzy.
She fell towards the floor, striking her head on the glass side as she went.
Everything began to fade.

In the next few moments of percepted twilight the beam stopped; the glass
raised; and Robotnik loomed over her laughing.

Laughing that resonated in her mind as she passed into the dark world.

Large tears ran down Sonic's face as he looked out to the sunrise, Bookshire
tried the best he could to comfort his friend, but failed to succeed, even
he could feel the pain, the loss. Princess Sally always did the comforting,
and now, she.. she was gone. The only thing left was her memory, he could
see her now, sitting on the wall they were on, comforting him about the
loss of Sidney.

The pain inside him boiled, but no tears ever rolled down his face. He took
a deep breath, causing his lungs to tingle. "Sonic, there is nothing you
could have done.. she .. was a fighter.. till the end.. she .. warned.."
He stopped just as his voice began to waver; dropped his eyes to the
green foliage below.

Suddenly Bunny came running up towards them, holding something shiny in her
hand. "Books!" she yelled as she came close enough for him to realise that
it was a CD, "ah rohbot gayve this to muh, sayd we should vyuu it..."
With that the three energetically headed to his hut, where he slid the shiny
mysterious disk into his computer.

He scanned it, there was a single file on it.
 <WITHLOVE.SVF> 635Mb
"A stereo-video file" he thought to himself, "..holographic video",
he plugged a silvery plate to his computer.

He looked back at them, they had been joined by Antoine, Rotor and Tails.
He squeezed a smile, "Okay, here it is.."
He loaded Autotech Play and selected the file.

An image formed between the two plates, it was Robotnik.
He smiled, "Hello my dear freedom fighters, this is my first home-video
release, so I intend to make it a good one. I call this movie 'Victory'."
The camera panned out, showing Sally in the Robotocizer.

There was a chord of worry from the band.

"You see" he pointed at the bulky machine, "this is a robotocizer, it
optimizes flesh. That over there is our experienced operator, Mr Packbell.
He makes sure that your process is as efficient as possible."
He clutched his robotocized arm, "you hedgehog have already given me a
demonstration of it, now it is my turn!"

Packbell pressed the switch.

"Aunt Sally?" Bunnie grabbed Tails, hugging him tightly; Rotor made sickly
noises and left the room; Antoine fainted; Bookshire looked down;
Sonic just stared on, hypnotized.

He saw her flesh turning to metal, her eyes filled with fear--turning red,
he choked, sorrow collapsing his heart. Before the conversion was complete
however, the video cut to another scene.

It was the new-Sally, coldly killing freedom fighters with a laser rifle.=7F
One after another she shot them down, even a cub, with no hesitation for
emotions. Tails made a whimpering noise as Bunnie lifted him away, cradling
the crying fox him in her arms.

Bookshire never saw the end of the clip, as Sonic aggresively drove his fist
through the holographic projector. Normally the raccoon would have been
angry, but in this instance he felt slightly relieved that he'd been saved
from enduring the rest of Robotnik's poison.

Sonic ran out of the room, Bookshire staggered behind him.
"Where are you going?"
"To Robotropolis!"
Bookshire was shocked, "It's too late! Don't Sonic, please! DON'T!"
But he was already gone.

The first thing Princess Sally did after she opened her eyes was to try and
raise her hand into her immediate field of vision. Something however
stopped her, so instead she rotated her head.

What she saw scared her more than she had expected, for her hand was NOT
robotic! Nor were her arms. She tried to sit up to see the rest of her body
but something stopped her. It took a few moments of reasoning for her to
realise that she was strapped to a.. a.. bed?

There was a laugh from somewhere out of her vision, a laugh like the one she
heard before she was ..<robotocized?> Robotnik lurked over her, grinning
evily. "My dear princess, about now you are wondering what I did to you?"
Sally didn't say anything, she DIDN'T want to know.

Robotnik called to his nephew, there was a short reply, and then a hovering
screen drifted over to above her. On it it was a still image of her in
the glass cylinder. The overlord laughed, "thanks to technology designed
a few hundred years ago, we are able to bring you, in full 3d, your *own*
robotocization!"

The video started up, showing the beam engulfing and changing her. She
looked at her hand again for reassurance.. As a result of this, Robotnik
burst into long uncontrollable laughs, then shouting to his nephew
again the video stopped and the image returned to the still of her before
the process.

"Now, my dear princess, watch carefully!"
The video started again, this time however, the beam just glowed around her,
yet did nothing. At the end she was treated to the sight of herself=
 fainting.

Ivo spoke evily, "Video Raster SE100, by Creative Fabs and Autotech
Reanimator, and you're ready to make your own videos!"
"You'll never get away with this!"
"Don't tell me you don't like it, it took my assistant three hours to edit
all the frames! You know, little critics like you get robotocized, but,
that comes later.. right now, I'd like you to watch my next release."

The screen went blank for a moment, until finally another video came on,
it was her! And in the video she was killing freedom fighters left, right
and centre. Then finally it came to a part where she waved at the camera,
"Hello Sally my dear princess, I'd like you to appreciate the phong
rendering capabilities of 4D Studio from Autotech. You see, what we do,
is digitise a mesh of you, import you, and we are ready to go.."
Sally opened her mouth in awe, the voice seemed similar enough to how she
heard it when it was played back to her from NICOLE's DA/AD converters.

Robotnik laughed, "now, after you've finished admiring yourself, there is
something just.. wonderfull.. that I'd like you to see."
"I don't want to see it!"
"Good, I like it when people resist!"
With that Packbell appeared out of thin-air, undid the straps and held her
so she could get a view of the ground.

Robotnik held a small box, then pushing some switches on it, a hologram of
her appeared.. though unlike normal holograms, this one was far more stable.
In fact, it looked exactly like her. Across the room Snively had several
devices of VR gear strapped to him, he danced around--the Sally hologram did
the same... he spoke, and in Sally's voice the hologram seemed to do the
same.

The android lifted her over to Robotniks face, he smiled, "You see, with
four speakers, we can get perfect directional sound. Now, what you are
probably wondering.. is what am *I* going to do now?"
Sally didn't reply, so Ivo continued.
"The home-video you watched just now was posted to your friends, all of it
except that very personal greeting message though.. well.. now all your.."
"HOW DARE YOU!"

Packbell clamped his hand over her mouth, and Robotnik continued.
"All your friends have got upset, right now, the only thing on their little
minds is your avengence.. And when they try, they will be amazed to
see you are still a .. fox.. squirrel.. whatever you are.. only you'll be
on *MY* side!" he motioned the holographic projector.

"MMMPFFGHHHAAA!!"
Robotnik smiled, "Packbell my boy, let our friend have her beauty sleep.."=
=7F
With that the android rapidly changed his grip, causing the princess to
pass out.

Sonic charged into the heart of Robotropolis, searching for something to
destroy, frantically tracking for a target, like a predator. Anger ruled in
him now, and for vengeance he would die--he didn't want to live anymore
anyway...

He headed for Robotnik's control structure, at his top speed, 350Kph, all
he could do without a power-ring. Suddenly he stopped--something caught
his eye.

Was his mind playing tricks on him? He looked again, Sally was standing
in front of the door. "Sal?" he asked stunned.
"Sonic" she whined, "please leave, if I move they're going to drop a ton
of bricks on me from up there!"
The hedgehog hesitated, there was something in her voice that he was not
familiar with, it wasn't fear... her voice seemed oddly calm and collected,
as if though she had accepted her fate.

He looked to the top of the building, a brick would take at least fifteen
seconds to fall that high. He looked at her again, "Sal? Are you okay?"
Her eyes seemed to stare through him, then she began, "It's the side effects
of the de-robotocizer, it seems to give an odd feeling of euphoria, while
the body is left disorientated for a short duration..."

Sonic looked at her strangely, she was right, he'd never heard her talk like
that before, it was almost robotic--which could have been a side-effect.
He looked to the top of the building again, "Okay Sal, I'm going to grab=
 ya..
are ya ready?"
"Certainly Sonic.. Am I not always ready?"
"Uuuh sure..Sal Okay?"

He raced forward, grabbing her hand, but something odd happened, his hand
went straight through hers. He tried again--the same result.
"Wait just a Sonic sec.." he began, when abruptly two probes burried
themselves in his skin. Just as he noticed the wires to them, a high voltage
seared through him, knocking him out cold.

..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'':..:'=

When he awakened he was in a glass cylinder, outside Robotnik was filming
his next home-video. After a lot more mumbling, Packbell threw a switch,
Sonic was immersed in yellow light.

He just stood there, waiting for the worst, but nothing happened. The
cylinder raised, and after he surveyed his body, he smiled, "Our special
guest star for today.. Sonic the HEDGEHOG!"

But Robotnik didn't seem bothered that his machine hadn't had the desired
results, instead he just smiled. "If I was going to robotocize you, don't
you think I would have succeeded at it?"
"Then what..?"

Robotnik smiled, "Well, you see, I just did something better.." He pressed
a button on a remote and the hover-screen began displaying a picture of
Sally. She was rolling around on the floor in agony, "No please don't make
me fade! PLEASE! PLEASE! NOOOO!" With that she lost her opacity.

Robotnik chuckled, "I can see right through her now! And soon you too will
fade completely from existance!"
Sonic was puzzled,"But why would she lead me into a trap?"
"Because" grinned Robotnik, "I offered her a trade, her existance for=
 yours!"

Sonic was bewildered, but in a moment of gripping the situation, he had
gripped something else -- Robotniks throat. Tilting his body
horizontally, he pressed his splines up against the overlords exposed neck.

Ivo choked, "Packbell!" The android just stood at a distance however, "I do
not have sufficient time to reach you from here."
Something body temprature
began rolling down the human's neck, he frantically tried to plan an escape.
"Wait rodent, if you kill me, you can say goodbye to your girlfriend!"
Sonic smoothly replied, "too bad, I don't like her anymore!"
Robotnik wheezed, "wait.. I .. lied, it was just a trick.. PACKBELL, bring
the princess.. QUICK!"
Sonic squeezed a bit tighter, enlarging the wound.
"Now..just..relax..hedgehog....just..relax.. That..image..you..saw..of..
her..was..just..a..hologram....so..relax.."

After a seemingly eternal wait, Packbell returned dangling the princess in
one of his hands. Sonic rotated a bit more, causing Robotnik to wheeze in
pain, "I don't believe you 'buttnik.. too bad.." Again the hedgehog edged
a few more degrees, cutting a bit deeper.
Packbell, picked up a bolt, and threw it against Sally's abdomen, it bounced
off. Sonic stopped slashing, "Sal.. is that you?"
Sally looked at him sadly, "Sonic, forget me!"
Robotnik's eyes exploded with fear, "If you kill me boy, you'll be burrying
your little friend in a bottle!"
Sonic smiled, "Maybe.. maybe not!" he rotated 10 degrees, blood began
torrenting out of the slash.

Packbell didn't waste any time, he pulled the pistol he had acquired while
fetching Sally and blasted the hedgehog.

But before Sonic was unconcious, he managed to rotate another thirty=
 degrees,
rupturing one on Robotnik's major arteries, and as the blue blaze fell,
a red blurr complemented him as it sprayed at the ceiling.

Robotnik frantically felt around on his neck, after five more squirts he
found the fatal-cut and held it closed with his robotic arm. Then in a cool
collected voice, looked down at the pathetic heap on the floor. "Ironic=
 isn't
it rodent.. the more you try to hurt me, the more you help me.." he glanced
at his robotic arm. Then rolling Sonic over with a softish kick, dictated to
Packbell. "Begin Rendering."

When Sonic awoke he was laying strapped to a bed, on the bed next to him was
Sally. And looming above him, with an array of bandages on his throat was
Robotnik. He smiled evily, "hedgehog, I would kill you now, but I thought
it would be so much better if your friends joined in the experience.. that's
why I have released a new video.. thanks to technology invented..."
A hover-screen began showing the next premiere, this time Sonic getting
robotocized, and doing morbid interrogations employing his splines.
It ended with Robo-Sal and Robo-hog emracing one another, telling the other
freedom fighters what a great time they were having.
Robotnik left, the metal door clanging shut, leaving them in the cold,
dark, damp, musty room.

Sonic wanted to be sick, he could see it now, Tails.. trembling as Bunny=
 tried
to explain his hero's "robotocization". He could see the little fox's hair
standing on end, tears pouring down his face, his voice wavering--hoping for
some miracle. He could see him waving his fist... screaming..

No, he could not let that happen, he stressed against the restraints with
a new-found energy. He pulled with all his might, but finally, his energy
gave way and he just lay there looking up at the ceiling.
Across from him he heard Sally's straps creaking like leather as she too
tried to escape... after a few moments it ended with her voice.

"Sonic.. have you got a plan?"
He struggled again, ".. wish I did.."

Just then a metallic-scraping noise came from across the room, it was
followed by metallic foot-steps, which neither of the freedom fighters
could witness from their position. Sally strained to look to her left,
"Sonic.. there's something there.. mmmpppffff!"
"Sal.. what's going on?"

<Click!>

"Sal?"

<Click!>

"Sally?"

<Click!> <[Thud]>

Sonic paused, desperation covering his face, what was going on? He tried
the best he could to look left, but failed against the straps. He stressed
with all his might, then futily let his head fall back.

Something soft covered his mouth, he struggled frantically before something
familiar came to him... that smell... it reminded him of...
<Click!>
A strange feeling came over his legs, something that made them feel cold.
<Click!>
Another feeling came, this time over his stomach, then a voice whispered
to him as the hand withdrew itself from over his mouth. "..Relax.."
<Click!>

The final strap gave way, allowing him to sit up and observe the scene,
Sally was standing by his head, while across from her was his Uncle.
"Uncle..Ch!"
"SHHHH!"

He jumped off the bed, shocked, then began, this time in a softer voice "I
thought.. I thought we were never going to.."
With that Sally embraced the hedgehog, a warm tear running down her soft=
 face.
The moment didn't last long however, Sonic quickly remembered the=
 propaganda.
"Shi.. We've got to stop Robotnik, he's got that video!"
His uncled patted him assuringly on the back, "There's no need to worry,=
 I've
already sent a message to Knothole, so.." he smiled, "time is on your=
 hands."

Sonic's sigh of relief was cut-off abruptly as the door made a metallic
clang--someone was unlocking it!
Sonic propelled his uncle back into the air-duct and replaced the grating.
The door began to slide open, firing a beam of brilliant light in from the
ionizer-lights in the hallway.

Before Snively even had a chance to realise what had happened, he was laying
strapped to one of the beds, with a less than pleased hedgehog looming over
him. "Securi...mmaaaammmgg!"; Sonic stuffed some of the bedding in his=
 mouth.


A moment later they were gone.

Quick Insert by Marken Psantis. (Simon's evil twin brother.)
_______________________________

David (Pistone) was sitting at home watching his Sonic clips for the
4357th time when something odd happened, there came a rumbling noise from
outside.. a booming, like a jet passing into supersonic flight.

He dived out of his house just in time to see a blue-ish blaze fill his
field-of-vision. "Sonic!" he called out.

However, he had made a fatal error,
and it cost him dearly, for what he mistook for a blue-spiny-thing was
in fact a high-voltage static discharge (Lightning for normal people); the
shard of energy ran through his body, causing mass-electrolysis. As such,
stopping him from ever getting cellulite, and at the same time, altering him
on the structural level.

>From that night forth, things began to change, he grew hair all over his=
 body,
(Even his palms!), he started growing a tail (Which he got caught in the
lawnmower.. OUCH!) Then he did the final thing, he changed his name to
 BOOKSHIRE DRAFTWOOD! [Echo/Reverb and Oversample FX here]

Then started a "Sonic the Hedgehog" page on the Internet.

Thankyou.. Marken. [The last of the sane]

"Sal, why're we here?"
Sally walked over to a set of probes lying on the floor, "I've got an=
 idea.."
Picking up a metallic unit she began rattling on it's keys, Sonic stood and
watched, he wasn't big in the computer thing. He began tapping his foot, the
waiting was really getting to him, he looked at the wall, at the ceiling, at
Sal again, stopped for a moment, and then restarted the whole process.

A few minutes later Sally made an intelligent noise, Sonic expectantly
looked at her, but she continued toying with the device.
More time passed, Sonic made another observation of the walls.

Finally Sally stopped, "Okay, see those gloves over there?"
"Yes?"
"Put them and the other sensors on..."
"But Sal..."
"Just do it, I have a plan."

Robotnik mumbled as he walked into the medical bay,
"My dear hedgehog, I have another video for... SNIVELY!" He almost tripped
in awe, "SNIVELY NO! What THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE!"

His nephew shrugged in fear, "mmmpharrghoon!" Robotnik went into dimmented
laughter, "Mmmpphaargoon! Is that all you can say for yourself!
Mmmmphhaargoon! Mmmphharrgoon! You let the hedgehog escape.. and that's all
you can say! Mmmmpharrgoon!"
He ripped the sheet out of Snively's mouth, "Is there anything you would
like to add to that?"

"Yes, you old coot, IF YOU HADN'T SCREWED UP AND THOUGHT THAT GUARDS WEREN'T
NEEDED, THEN they wouldn't be free now WOULD THEY.. WOULD THEY!!!"
but instead Snively simply made a pathetic whimper which was soon drowned
out as a multitude of punch combos rained down on him.

A few minutes later Robotnik was even more annoyed, his only means of
relieving stress had passed out, he shuffled out the room, leaving his
nephew still strapped to the bed. "..Mmmphaargoon! "

Entering the hallway he glared at everything that passed him as he headed=
 for
his personal quarters, abruptly he stopped, remembering something. Lifting
up a nifty little communicator he regained a grin. "Control, are there any
prisoners we haven't interrogated yet?" He stared across the hall as he
waited for a response.

"Sorry, we have no prisoners.." Robotnik stopped dead, Princess Sally was
walking just meters away, seemingly without noticing him she turned into
a room on his right. "Sir?" The communicator interrupted, "Sir, will that
be tolerable?"
Robotnik was already walking to the room his desire to inflict pain greater
than his logic, "yes.. that will be more than adequete.. goodbye."

He stopped at the doorway, smiled, patted the bandages on his neck, then
whacked the open switch, ready to tear anything he saw into pieces with his
bare hands. But all he saw was the princess curled up at the end of the=
 room,
in front of the fake robotocizer as if though she was sleeping,
his arms tingled with morbid desires.
He (almost) floated forward, chanting as he went, "my dear princess..."

Strangely she didn't seem shocked by his presence, not even turning around
to face him. "Just go away.." she moaned.
He wasn't used to being dictated to, "WHAT!?!"
"I said, just go away, leave me alone.."
"What?" Robotniks mind boggled.

He was now in close enough proximity to grab her, but he was far too shocked
for that. She was kneeling forward looking down, her face almost touching
the floor. He himself kneeled, curious as to what she was doing.

She rotated her head to face him, her face at the same height as his.
"Julian.." she smiled, "there's only one thing your videos don't have.."
He stared at her confused, until a voice came from behind, "We need you!"

The HEDGEHOG! He turned his head around in chaos, but at the same time,=
 Sally
dropped a loop over his neck, and rolled backward, he turned back to grab
her, when suddenly the situation asserted itself. The cord jerked, dragging
him into the digitizer, the glass cylinder lowered, entrapping him inside.

His threats were cut off as the tube fully completed it's descent, Sonic
grinned at the squirrel, "Show-time!"
<CLICK!>
A yellow beam began to immerse the overlord, who continually banged against
the glass. His yells being reduced to a dulled groan.

Eventually the fun was over, the beam finished digitizing him; He started to
bang at the glass again, this time even cracking it. Then Sonic walked
towards him, grinned, looked back to the princess, and after a flash of
light changed to look just like him!

Sonic chuckled beneath his photon covering, Sally had beem right, the
squirrel walked over to him, pushed the holographic computer into the
hologram, took some cuffs off a wall, put them on, and then walked off with
Son-botnik posing as his prisoner.

The glass shattered under another blow, and Robotnik was free, he grabbed
a rifle off a weapons rack, and headed into the main hall, calling to
swat-bots as he went.

They crowded around him, and then suddenly, grabbed him. He heard his=
 nephews
voice resounding from down the hall, "Let's see what this..imposter has to
say after *WE* do some convincing..." Then Packbells voice added, "Well, I=
 do
need a subject for that new experiment of mine.."

Robotnik squirmed, "Fools! This is me!"
Snively walked over in a non-standard attitude and punched him on the nose,
"Robotnik is powerfull, you're just plain pathetic hedgehog!"
Ivo roared with anger, "SNIVELY!"
Packbell just smiled, "We'll see how long that act lasts for. Swat-bots, to
my laboratory!"

"Brilliant" Simon smiled as he studied the DNA string his measly 486DX40 had
churned out, "it's perfect!" He popped the disk into his molecular
reorganizer--a brilliant system capable of turning digital DNA strings into
their real world equivalents. (And running OaSis/2)

The machine finally came to a halt, spewing out the product, a creature
with eight legs and a long tail. It's body was completely covered in
Silicon.

"How Cute!" the human commented as it hugged onto his face and wrapped it's
tail around his throat.

After a day however he grew bored of it, and after finding it rather hard
to detach, donned a scalpel. With a little trimmin, it dropped neatly off.
When he picked it up, he found to his dismay that it was dead, "bummer" he
said to himself, and then looking again, "Shit! Ma's gonna kill me, that
cute thingies acidic blood has eaten right through the carpet!"

Later on that day, Simon had some indigestion while eating his favourite
food--fetta cheese. In the process another creature just like the one he had
thrown on the garbage dump, (after playing with it with the lawn roller),
ruptured out of his stomach.

As he dropped to the floor in agony he said to himself, "Darn, I don't like
those things anymore.. but I'll let that sucker get away.. after all,
what harm can *one* little alien do anyway?"

Without a digestive system Simon no longer drinks coffie, and has resorted=
 to
injecting caffeine instead, he currently holds the task of protecting the
planet Earth from "Killer-mutant-off-road-racing-mice-from-Mars."

I wish it were that simple.  Unfortunately, even when I'm at the rat.org
homepage and try to click from there to your own homepage I get the
"File Contains No Data" message.  Must be my machine, because I was able
to get one of the library terminals with Netscape to find it.  Since it
took the tech guys over a week to get around to hooking me up to the Net
after moving my office, I haven't seen fit to bother them with this
problem.  Oh well, we persevere....

Hiya All!

Excuse me if I come across as a lamer co-ord, badly carbonize DTA_loser, but
would anyone like to give me suggestions on how to obtain the cartoons.
I saw there was some Buena Vista site, or something, but I'm all the way
in South Africa (Africa, you know elephants, drums etc.) 

Let me tell you something that will make you sympathise with me, I only saw
three episodes of the high-quality series, and they were in Zulu (odd language),
I saw too many of  the syndicated series(simulcasted naturally).. Yep the
SABC are good at doing stuff like that. 

Hey! SABC wake up.. they speak ENGLISH EVERYWHERE! EVEN ON MOBIUS!

Feel sorry for me..

Cheers

*blinks* Woah! you're in Africa! Neato! :) Anyways, I don't know of any
areas near you that have the tapes, but I have a good ammount. (Problem is,
I live in the USA) If you want, I could see about dubbing ym two tapes I
have. They have some of the first season, and alot of the second season.
About 21 episodes total. That isn't all of them, though, but the majourity.

Hey, you're stories are pretty cool, Joe.

Do you think I can use your character.  His moody personality will be great

Hiya Yello, the Si_man is back [Oh no, not again!]

Okay, I'm not really sure if this is the best place to post this message, and
posting it actually kinda feels like I got one foot in megamuck and the other
on a bar of soap.. [The puns Si.. watch those puns!]

We've all seen games like VGA-planets, where you attach your messages via 
Email... right? [Games? Flaming probability risen to 30%]

What I was thinking about was writing a game that all of us Sonic freaks could
play in together. [Simon SHUT UP! YOU'RE GOING TO GET BUMPED OFF BY SEGA!]
I was thinking of something down the lines of you choosing your name etc, what
you are.. [he means are you a furry, spikey, cuddly, or smoothy]
Some of your abilities etc.

The only problem is copyrights, the game will of course be freeware, but still
that doesn't excuse the copyrights.. [Or does it? Come on lawyers.. say it!]

[OKDTA, you think Simon is a window sucker by now, yeah me too! But the guy has
some pretty amazing game technology... He continually remarks about his VBA or
whatever it is graphics libaries. He says that the systems gameplay will be 
something like syndicate. Where you have missions, you know, like stopping 
Rokrudnik blowing the crap out of some furry.]

Thanks Mark, well, he's right, you'll undertake missions play them, and I'll
hopefully work out something where we end up affecting one another.. I am
still trying to work out how to go about allowing real-time play.. Naturally
that would mean BYEBYE windows.. hmm.. anyone have a dos internet driver?
[HELLO SIMON! THESE ARE SONIC FREAKS! NOT CODERS!]

Well, that 'bout it. [4% chance of being alive on Sunday!]

Cheers
Ablater

[Whoohaay! Have a bril day.. Marken Psantis.. Sim_mans 2nd personality]

How would it differ from MUCKing/MUSHing over the net... or rather, the
question is, what TYPE of game would it be?

Hello All, Dan asked what the game would be like.. so here I go!

The game type I was thinking of would be something like syndicate, where you
see the map from the air. (Kinda like looking down at a doll house at 45degrees)

I was thinking of there being seperate freedom fighter parties, (with group
leaders etc.) You create your character, lets say Dan is a Fox.. a vulpea 
vulpea (red fox) Right? Okay, now Dan has 35 study points, so before he becomes
a freedom fighter, he says "Okay, lemme see.."

Unarmed Combat:10
Armed   Combat:20
Digital System:5
bla           :0
bla           :0
bla           :0

Later on as time goes by, he gains more study time, so he can upgrade the
points.

Then he is randomly assigned to a group of furry freedom fighters, Okay.. 
So Dan ends up in .. the southside freedom pack.
He gets told a little story, maybe with some good music and Sound Blaster sound,
as I do have the units to do that. [They're all mine AAHAHAHAH!]

The group leader then sees that there is a big mean nasty swat-bot plant, and 
realises after he loses five of his teams to it that he'd better give someone
else the Job.. so he puts a message in the out thing.. Of course, someone has to
deliver the mail in the game. So one guy has to do a mail-mission. [low-risk]
{By the way, seeing that you won'y know the guys real name Email will be
useless!}

Okay, So now let say Lindsay's team, (Who have developed a Swat-Splat
laser.. okay too lame name.. a Gravatic Particle Displacer Weapon [GPDW],
decide to
do the mission, then Lindsay selects someone to carry it out. That person is
then given his main character, some guys who go with him. [who by the way aren't
players.. so if they get killed.. it only effects the team strength, doesn't
cause some guy who didn't play to get the message.. "You were killed when
someone else got wasted.. Game Over"]

That player, next time he gets his player file, sees that he has a mission, so
he grabs some coffie and begins. He is given a view like syndicate. hmm,
lets see how my Asci art looks..

*---------------------------*------*
|                           | NAME |
|                           | INFO |
|  /----/|                  |------|
| /----/ |                  | TEAM |
| |   |  |                  | INFO |
| |   | /|                  |      |
| |   ||/                   |------|
| |___|/   MAP VIEW         | =3D= |
|                           | View |
*---------------------------*------*

Okay, how does that look? 

The name-Info box would say something like: "Dan the Itchy", health 43%, stamina
92%, carrying--Stunned Fox[SAM].

Team Info would be all the team members, listed like this.
Eg.

Mark|*CAPTURED*|
Sam |*STUNNED* |
Jas |*HACKING* |46%.
Jon |*LOOKOUT* |SAFE
Dan |*IDLE*    |

Now you could click on any of these, and TADA, you'd go to them. 

Okay now the little 3dview box, is kinda like a wolfenstein view, my gaming
technology level is nearly there, so with any luck, by the time the game is 
near complete, I should be able to put that feature in.

The main view, is the Syndicate/Ufo/WarCraft style view.

Other infos: When someone is on lookout, if they see something.. they tell you,
either over Sb or via a dialog box.

Your players don't get killed by swat-bot fire, they get stunned, the swat-bots
will then try to take them to the swat-bot hover unit. If they succeed at this, 
then that player is captured. (Course, if you waste em before they get to the
car.. the stunned guy is all yours.. again.)

If players get too close to swat-bots, and aren't in combat mode, they also get
grabbed, and can be captured.. though you have a certain amount of control 
over a conscious player who's being carried by a swat.. 

'Nuff said.

Well, I hope that clears it up.. Anyone have anything more ta say?

[Check the Sega job offers, they're looking for an assasin now.]

Cheers
Ablater

Alex,

Join the club -- I'm still waiting myself.  It's been about two months,
which means it's about at the end of the "Please allow 6 to 8 weeks for
delivery" period for a subscription to kick in.  I waited nearly as long
to receive the Princess Sally miniseries, which I ordered for myself
from Archie.

If you've been following the Subscription thread, you're probably aware
that Archie has been having problems of their own in implementing a new
subscription procedure, and other subscribers are waiting as well --
ones who had already subscribed.  Believe me, as soon as I receive
anything in the mail it'll be forwarded to you.

I give it another week; if there's no sign of anything by Nov 10, I
promise I'll not only send you a money order for the $20 you sent me,
but I'll also include my copy of Sonic #29 that I bought off the rack.
You'd think some things in this life would be EASY....

BTW: Your Mom should probably get together with my wife, who questions
my sanity for being interested in Sonic!

I don't know how, but I FINALLY found my way to the Bookshire Home Page
yesterday and nailed it down with a new bookmark.  So looks like THAT's
settled.

BTW: my appreciation for the "illustrated" Sonic fanfics that have come
along lately, especially the depiction of "Davy Crockett".  The first
time I read the story, I kept picturing Fess Parker wearing a hat made
out of one of Bookshire's relatives!  I figured he'd lost the arm when
he was hacked to death at the Alamo.  Knowing that we're talking about a
furry helps.

Hiya all,

I really apologize if I am turning this conference into a damned gaming area,
but it seems that being a coder and having all that inspiration and
creativity just stains everything, wherever I go.. [Gee too bad! Si_man]

But my hope is to gain some sort of backing from you guys here, after all *WE*
are the fruitcakes of the world. Our friends and family do make comments like..
"Hey Simon, Princess Sally called for you while you were in the bath.."
Or make observations like, "Hey, Simon Howes, you have the same initials as 
Sherlock Holmes and Sonic the Hedgehog!"
Or something like, "Hey, Si, your Sisters name is Toni? Right, whoohayy.. 
Sonic and Tails.. Simon and Toni... And Tails is younger then Sonic too!"

So considering that we are all.. no.. we are not social outcasts, just socially
alternate. [How's that for politically correct?]

Okay then, why would I be building up a group? Nope, we're not going to
storm into Sega with shotguns, nor are we going to rush the USA alien
storage bases hoping to find blue hedgehogs.. but rather I going to use
you.. No... "use" sounds stupid, well you get the idea.. I can do all the
coding myself.. but GFX and stuff.. ARGHH! I'm an artist, but I'm not about
to go and define the maps for the whole of Robotropolis.. or two-hundred
missions.. Get the idea.

So flame me or join me.. after all what do we have to lose, you guys yourself
said it.. you wanted a free mobius.. what you scared of? Uncle Gates and his
Robotocizer.. hehe.. Macroslofts robotocizer will never work, it runs under
Windoze 9_something. [Sorry bad joke, had to be done]

P.S. I Will accept flaming at my normal Email address... please don't break the
team spirit by flaming me here. [Unless it's Really Really Runny!] 

Okay, anyone got a loophole in the law for us yet?
Maybe someone could beg Sega.. Or we pull a "My friend who.. died of cancer
coded this.. as freeware.. too bad haha! Sue his grave!"

Cheers
Ablater [Call 'im reckless, stupid, a plank, but never never.. NEVER cute!]
        [He tries to mantain a strength thing..Abseils etc.]

Geez! This game will rock! If you can get the OK for it, that is. (If
not... well, I HOPE ya could at least try to make it and show us what it's
like.) I have been waiting a LONG time for a PC Sonic game of ANY kind to
come out.

Okay everyone,

I decided to give the game a go-ahead, I've never been the patient type, so
I'll deal with being sued/assisinated later... Right now, it's on to some
serious coding.. First thing that we will need is a site for operations.
This area is probably not the best place [Spies I tell you spies! ARGHH!]

Maybe someone can beg in somewhere? Calling on the Ratman, calling on the
Ratmans world.. [If you know what I mean]

Let's see now, any Musicians out there can email me, GFX guys, go ahead to,
don't email to this area but rather to me direct.. ablater@lin01.global.co.za
Coders are welcome too...

Okay, John Bintz.. welcome to the team, we need a GFX guy, and your Bunnie
hugged has been on my HD for a while now.. Glad to meet ya.

Musicians, We've got a guy already, he's composed some really good (FC
Quality) songs, but any further composers would be great. (midi composer
preferred)

GFX artists who want a piece, come on, only me and John so far, and I'm going to
be too busy injecting caffeine to code to do GFX.

We need a chief whip! Not someone who says" Si, how far" but someone who
says"Simon have it done by friday or I mail every email adress in the world
with your child hood pictures!"

Site still needed..

Hey archie comic guys, we *need* you! (Like the taz song.. we need you!)

Okay, here's to the wonderfull!
Ablater [OOHHH YEAAAH!]

Hey,not wait,,,,,dont do that.....I will wait the time necessary to get my

My mom dont likes so much Sonic but she doesnt cares about him.She thinks
that is normal in a girl of my age.And Im using the lists to learn
English,also I want to use the comics for that.

{{I'm not going to quote all that}}

I think furtoonia is something like that. I have seen it only a few
times because my telnet program is terrable. And it seems to be what
your thinking. As for another sonic like game I had 2 ideas in the
works. The first is on hold. It was an ad-on for Lagend of the Red
Dragon that whould make it into a sonic game and the other is a game
that if I use the right feature It whould be able to play on any kind of
computer. am still researching how to use Inform to write text
adventures in the famous Infocom format. I was going to tell my first
stories in an Interactave format to add a 3rd demention to my stories.
But this seems verry hard and I might resort to useing a PC-Only game
writer like this.  Because they are both just text and will be freely
distibuted I hopefuly won't have to fight with sega on this (G)

Personally, even if it can't be made using SONIC characters...it wouldn't
make a bad "furry" game of some sort.   Just make up some decent sonic-like
characters just make them original.

Hiya Fellow Freedom Fighters,

Anybody who's been getting their mail recently will have realised that there
has been a good deal of talk about a game. The proposed plan is to pull
together a development team, dedicated to the production of a freeware game
for all of us freedom fighters, and then do something wonderfull.

However to do this we require your support, everyone has some ability or
the other. Whether you are a coder a GFXer , a musician or can just get
us a site to operate from.. if you are interested -==> Continue.

Okay, first I might as well go about setting our limits, objectives.

(I) The legal stuff

1.) The game is a non-profit effort.
2.) It should be classed as fan-fiction.
3.) The game will not be based directly on the Sonic the Hedgehog games from
SEGA, nor will it employ a similar game system.
4.) The game will be based on the Dic/Archie.. Mobian storyline.
5.) The game will be used only by us and those who join our midst by
    searching too late at night for "Sonic."

(II) Good ideas. (Some may call them rules.)

1) Until we have a site of operation, mail to me directly:
        ablater@lin01.global.co.za
    I will pass any really good/interesting/inspiring ideas on.
    This is to prevent the Sonic conference being filled with DSP play
    routines, GFX and Modplayers.

2) When mailing to me, feel free to tell your lifes story, absolute moronic
    and useless junk, swear like hell and other such. Though note that if
    I repost your mail I will of course <CENSOR> it. Oh ya, if you don't
    want everyone to hear about your cuddly pillow etc.. just tell me.

3) Don't try and sell us your art/music/code: We don't pay you anything,
   you don't pay us anything and we all get a free Knothole.[good deal huh?]

4) If you don't have any abilities, just put your name down for bug testing.


Okay, the Application thing.. here goes....

Quick question: If the "sudden change in environment" from the Void to
Mobius is too much for King Acorn, who (I think, but I'm not well-versed in
info on the cartoon) has been there about ten years, how come the change
from Mobius to the Void isn't a problem?  Just a thought...

Here it is.
I guess I have to get permission to keep the other stuff there, which I
intend to do. They are watching me, so I have to play along. :-(

I got a call from Sega today. Anne Jordan was her name.
She said she had a problem with the sexually explicit pictures on my 
server. She asked that I take them off.

Well, I think they have that right, so I did.

She called me over the phone, and I told her I'd like an official email from
them. I'll post that email here when I get it. 

She also gave me some grief about the other images there and said I should
ask permission from the Marketing people. She only specifically told me to
remove the perverted (she didn't use that word) ones, so that's what I did. I
think I'll leave everything else up there unless they have a problem. 

Since bookshire's pages (and graphics) are on my server, you can't view those
pics there either. 

I have never run into copyright problem before, and I'm kind of surprised I
never got busted sooner. But I am going to cooperate since I don't have a
lawyer. :-)

They probably quoted prices in pounds.  VAT is Value Added Tax, roughly 
comparable to sales tax in the USA.  You may not have to pay it if you 
don't live in the UK.

It's published every 2 weeks.  The prices they quoted are probably for a 
year.

To find out how much xxx pounds is in your currency, check with your 
local bank.  Some newspapers also print this on the stock market pages.

HEEEEEY!!!!  I only added X because that's the way the Prodigy Sonic club's
been doing it forever, and besides, I got ENOUGH irritated responses (all
right, one) from the club members I didn't include!  Besides, if it makes
anybody feel any better, X didn't have any better role than Sonic!  (And
besides that, now that I think of it, your attack is more appropriate to my
friend Eric's story, and I REALLY LIKED THAT STORY!!!)

Well, how am I supposed to introduce Maxl/Jade/Tracker without them having
a big part of the story?  Besides, there were others that did that and
remained really good: The entire Tolouse Trilogy, the stories involving
David Prower, and probably plenty of others I either haven't read yet or am
too lazy to mention!

Use a word processor that won't let it, and your troubles are over!
(Bunnie's Bad Day was fine in Microsoft Word!)

Well, now that I'm finished defending myself, I'd like to say that very few
of these <ahem> "problems" will occur in my next story, The Hunt Begins
(except maybe the mega-depressing part, although it definitely won't be as
sad as On My Mother's Grave or Bloodlines), in which Sonic pretty much
remains the hero and very few third-party characters are mentioned (I would
give you a list of characters who DO, but it you'd think it was longer than
it actually is, because of various complicated events that I'm not about to
give away before the story's finished).  I personally think it's the best
Sonic story I've written in quite a while (which isn't really saying much
since the only other one in the past few months is Jaded Views, which isn't
exactly my best work, whether I defend it or not), and it'll be worth the
wait, but that's for you to decide!

Now see here! I know Sir Kain (in my 1st story) was in it alot. And I
aggree with what you mean, but c'mn! Let a guy write a story the way he can
do best. I am not trying to steal the show. I'm jsut trying to develop a
good, solid character. This was an ORIGIN story anyways. I'm sorry if some
don't like it, but i'l try my best to avoid it if many disagree. (BTW,
Bookshire has the story but has been severely swamped to be able to update
the page...)

FI you read mine, please tell me if I had any in there.. I try to have a

I used Microsoft Word for Windows to type mine up, then converted it into

Whohaaay, relax everyone, I didn't say there was anything wrong with adding
characters, having ninjas, or having sad parts, I simply said that my story
wasn't going to go down those lines. Hey, a story, that I'm still fixing up
makes me feel real bad because Sonic isn't in it enough.. he's in about 40K
of the 120K

You seem to give me the impression that you feel like I'm pointing you out
or something.. <MBG> But don't worry, I've written two stories that would
get killed by my "it doesn't thingy"   I still have to release the stories,
but I just wondered how I would do at writing a Sonic only story.. That's all.

And "Bloodlines", and "On my mothers grave" and most of the stories are
brilliant, the depression adds to the story. The whole Tolouse series I find
exceptionally good. My "it doesn't" thingie doesn't discredit the stories
that do include fan-fiction created characters, nor does it discredit
stories that have ninjas in, or are depressing. It simply says that this
story, won't have any of that in: 
>>but unlike some stories I've
>>seen, it doesn't:

See? 

And for the info, I enjoyed ninety-five percent of the stories, Yes, I had
to meditate after that one night I read about five stories where freedom
fighters are getting thrown away like disposable diapers, but I still
enjoyed the stories. There were only a few, that I naturally, won't mention,
that I didn't enjoy. Generally I found this to be because the stories were
huge spelling and grammar mistakes on such a level no mere human could make
head or "Tails" of it.

Okay, so don't anyone flame me now, I didn't say YOUR story sucked, just
some stories. (5%)

Let me guess now, someone is going to come to me and say: "Hey Si, none of
the stories suck, so therefore you are saying that five percent of MY story
sucks!"

ARGHHH!

Cheers

*shrug* Just write the best ya can in the best way ya know. I have read
about every single sonic story out there, and I've enjoyed all of them so
far, except how OMMG ended, but some things are just gonna end that way...
And I knwo you were not saying that it wasnt ok to add characters, but you
did bring up a good point. Alot of people including me, aren't focusing on
the main characters liek in the TV show. Like, Kain in my 1st story was in
it alot, while Sonic and Sally were not. But it is HARD to try to write a
story without the new characters and have it interesting. *sighs* I guess I
just haveta keep trying.

Well if you need drrrect mail to make it official I can do that. but I
whould be glad to be a Beta Tester for it. I am good at finding cheats
and little holes in games. Akso if you want to add something like a 1st
persion level or so I can legaly get you rthe source codes for Wolf3d as
 examples or so. But other thean that I can just be a tester.

I will support anything that involves the freedom of expression.  Sega is
wrong to do this...they've already screwed us out of a 3rd season, and now
the porno.  What's next?  Perhaps the *regular* pictures?  Perhaps they'll
tell us to get rid of a fanfic story because it `isn't the image we want
Sonic the Hedgehog associated with'.

Personally, I'm FED UP with Sega's behavior.  This is too much.  Censoring
a few porno pics is where they'll start.  This is how they build a CASE.
Soon, if this awful trend continues, they'll regulate every part of StH 
fandom...unless we get OFF OUR TAILS and make a *big* stink about this.  
The more press we can generate about this incident, the more likely they'll
back down.  

Most large corporations are cowardly; they don't like bad PR, and
especially from the Internet.  And if we got a lot, I bet we could
generate enough press to get a substancial number of people interested in
the StH cartoon again.

(Think about it.  This is a 1st Amendment issue.  The EFF would get behind
us all the way if we could just get their attention...)

Cool, THAT'll teach Sega for leaving us hanging with new Sonic games, and
SCREW them lawyers!  We'll make our own!!!!

Myself, I'm tempted from time to time to make a Doom-Killer set in
Robotroplis.  You get to shoot the [censored] out of swatbots and watch them

If you are worrying about a free Mobius, wait til you find out what I'm gonna
do to Uncle Chuck...oh, by around BAM VI, say.  I'll won't spoil it for
everybody.

Oh, and about this game that Simon Howes is thinking up--a good idea.  I'm
pulling my hair out waiting for Sega to come out with a Sonic 4, or at least
a Sonic CD for IBM.  I don't know of any game stats for my characters yet,
but once I find out what Simon's ideas are on over this game, and if he'll
e-mail me about it :-)  I'll think up something.  I'll even sign up my
services as one of the artists for the game, and as you'd see from my Web
Page, I'm a preety kick-butt good artist!

That's a good question...good thing I'm answering this off-line....hmmmm..

It could only be a 'one way' problem....The Void itself could set this
ailment into a person's molecular structure while being inside the void.  It
couldn't be a problem going from Mobius to the Void, because the problem
wasn't 'burned into the DNA' at that time...

But then again, I've been way off course before......

I can understand their objection on the porno. But fan fiction? I will stand

I had to ask 3 times for an offical email. But they were concerned that "Sega
would be made out to be a bully". And I told her that if she was going to ask
me to take it down, she would have to ask me to take it down. There is no way
I was going to take it down if they were not going to even ask me officially.

I don't know enough about the legal issues.
But aside from that, I'd rather not get on Sega's bad side unless it's
necessary. If they tell me to take down the regular pics, I will have to get
on their bad side. 

boy, I get the feeling that this is going to be a hot topic for this list for
awhile....

The way I operate is I violate every copyright law in existance. And if the
author of any material asks me to take it down, I'll cooperate as best I can. 
This is a unique situation because Sega has the rights to the characters, and
that's it. It's not like I took a screen grab and am distributing that.
Things like fan art and even fan fiction I feel are not property of Sega just
because the characters are Sega's property.

And I can sort of understand Sega's perspective. They just don't want it
readily available.

I'll say this, if anyone wants to host the Sonic porn pics, I still have the
pics. And I could put links to the new location. This of course would be
totally *NOT OK* with Sega, and you would surely get some heat for it. So how
about it? Any one want to go to jail? :-)

You could put them up on a hidden Web page which SEGA need not know about, 
something that isn't linked to by the main sonic page, but that list members
would know the HRL address of.

Hmmm..., do you know how SEGA found your page? Do they actually have people who
just surf the web looking for these things?

I'd rather not. nice thought though. I don't want to be the frontrunner in
getting Sonic spooge art on the net. I don't want to be known for this.

Good question. The woman who called me on the phone was definaly not net 
literate. Her email wasn't even configured right. He had her name 
misspelled. Luckily I figured it out and was able to mail her.
But maybe some other people surf the web for Sega... I don't know.

Sorry, but it seemed to me like you were pointing fingers, and most of 'em
seemed to be pointed at me...now that I think about it, when you said
"ninjas" you must have been referring to Kabuki, and I would say take that
up with her creator instead of me, except she lost Fraudigy...the GOOD news
(in the opinions of a few) is that, for that reason, her character (which I
admit to liking) won't be in too many new stories...she has a REALLY
IMPORTANT part in one of my Ignition Factor stories (small, but really
important nonetheless), and I'm not about to exclude her and replan the
whole thing, but I guess I can exclude the Siamese cat in all the others...

If the shoe fits, wear it.  Taking the pictures off that were in bad taste
was one thing, I can agree with that; but asking that you remove the other
pictures unless you get permission from Sega is not only unethical, it's
probably illegal.  I mean, that's like saying no-one's allowed to express
that they like Sonic unless they sit around 24-7 playing through all the
games again and again.  If those fools try to cripple the site, I'm not
getting a Nomad (which I was considering) and never even renting a Saturn
(I wasn't planning on buying one anyway).  I might even cancel my
subscription to the comic, since Sega gets a % of that!  And, of course,
that wouldn't be the last of it.  If they keep this crap up, I'd reduce
myself to one of the lowest blows possible: spamming.  I'd give 'em bad
publicity on every newsgroup I possibly could!  I'd ask all my friends to
attack 'em on their sites!  I'd dis 'em so much, Nintendo would vote me man
of the year!!!!!!   <VBG>

Of course, with any luck, Sega isn't moronic enough to attempt that crap.
On the other hand, Si might want to hold off on publicity for his game for
a while so as not to make the sitch worse...

Actually, unless you have formatted a story with a word processor it makes
no sense whatsoever to use MIME, BINHEX, or even my favorite, UUENCODE
on the files.

In any event, it is probably best to send stories in all text so that 
anyone can read them... Not everyone can read files produced by say...
Microsoft Word 7 for Windows 95's format... however you SHOULD be able
to save such stories in 'Text Only' from any word processor (and it IS 
nice if line are 80 characters or less... especially for those on UNIX 
boxes or those using dumb terminal emulators).

If you HAVE gone to the trouble of making fancy formatting or including
pictures the best options I can think of are:
  (1) Include a formatted version which can be downloaded from Bookshire's
      story archives.
  (2) Create an HTML version viewable like David Gonterman's stuff.

By the way...

Just to include something Sonic-Relevant, a while back I had e-mailed 
Sega via their WWW site (http://www.segaoa.com) and asked them if there
were any new Sonic games planned...

Their reply was a typical business non-answer:

  We cannot confirm or deny if there is going to be a new Sonic game 
  however Sonic is very important to this company and you can be sure 
  we would not abandom him.

(actually that was paraphrased... I cannot find the original letter)

Cool stories by the way.. So far I haven't gotten around to reading all
of the newest ones though... I FINALLY have some possible staring points
for a few Sonic stories... I don't know if/when I'd be able to get around
to filling in enough of the details to actually have real stories though.

I WOULD like to download a few drawings I've made of Sonic and some of 
the Freedom Fighters... They look a bit different because I was having 
'fun' with the drawings.

	David considered his options as the laser slowly (by his
timebase, anyway) approached their position on the ground.  His
first thought was to dislocate himself and Dulcy by utilizing
his warp drive.  The idea died as soon as it was created, due to
the fact that his warp drive required two seconds (in real-time)
to prestart and engage.  Another option was to fire at the laser
beam with his phaser.  The only problem was, the laser had too
wide of a dispersion radius, and only part of the energy would
be deflected.  His final choice was to block the laser with his
graviton shields.
	33 microseconds and 100 meters from the laser emitter later,
the beam struck a 1.26 MW graviton shield.  The spatual
distortion spread throughout the shield as Cerenkov radiation,
the familiar blue flash that was also seen when David engaged
and disengaged his warp drive.  The two Freedom Fighters were
safe from their deadly technological adversary for now.
	Not content to allow the laser array to continue firing in
order to disable the protective barrier, David decided to make a
lethal retort of his own.  After locating the laser's power
supply and targeting it, he balled his paws into fists and
raised his right arm.  Immediatedly after extending his index
finger, he resonated his phaser frequency to match that of his
shields and fired a 30 kW phaser beam.  33 microseconds later,
the laser array was converting into a stream of superheated
metallic and gabbro vapor.
	"Alright!" Dulcy cheered, elated at the fact of being saved
from near-death for the second time that day.
	"We're not secure yet," her comrade returned, locating other
nearby laser arrays and dispensing with them accordingly.  After
their immediate threat had been eliminated, he said, "I believe
now would be a suitable time to depart."
	The dragon nodded in total agreement.  "Music to my ears,
David!  Hop on, we're getting out of here!"
	As the vulpine executed his associate's suggestions, his
sensors detected a new threat flying from a remote location in
the Dark Mountain region.  Hover Units, and not the standard
Robotropolis grade either.  These were new supersonic designs,
predatory and fast.  David looked at Dulcy with a measure of
intense concern.  His companion stared at him for a second,
matching his gaze and appending her stare with bafflement. 
Saying nothing, David pointed to three red dots rising over the
horizon, their forms resolving into their dangerous aeroframes
as they flew closer.
	The dragon's head turned toward the indicated direction.  Her
sharp eyes spotted the Hover Units, and quickly darted over
them, gaging what she and her friend were up against.  After
widening her eyes and quickly cocking her head backward with a
jolting motion with horror, Dulcy abruptly kicked herself away
from the ground.  With a flurry of flapping wings and a very
powerful propulsive force from the snapping of a long dragon
tail against air, the pair shot away from their new adversaries.
	Knowing that Dulcy's upper velocity limit would never approach
that of the Hover Units, David released his leghold on his
associate's back and grasped onto her harness with an almost
unrestrained strength.  After uncovering the protective slits
from his impulse drive exhaust ports and covering himself and
the dragon in a shield to avoid injury by fight stresses, the
vulpine immediately began accelerating toward a valley in the
Dark Mountains fringe area.
	The Hover Units followed, openning fire on their prey.  David
did not return fire, but increased his shield power to safely
dissapate the laser energy, as well as compensate for
aerodynamic stresses caused by their velocity.  In an effort to
draw the pilots' attention to their targets and away from the
sensors mapping the valley, he increased his velocity gradually,
forcing the Hover Units to draw more power from the fusion power
supplies.  The predators continued firing, apparently unaware of
the fact that the valley ended with a large gabbro cliff 400
kilometers into the distance ahead.
	Satisfied that he and Dulcy had the pilots' complete attention,
part of the fox's mind reviewed a set of complex calculations
and other data.  Pushing himself lightly away from his comrade,
he rapidly flew into position.  A ring of intense blue light
formed around his tails as they rotated.
	Three seconds from the cliff face, David's shield began to
become distorted from its spherical form and the graviton energy
elevated into the higher energy states.  He directed himself and
the dragon to an orientation parallel to the cliff.  At the time
of one second away from when the Freedom Fighter pair would
otherwise have an intimate knowledge of what the chemical
composition of gabbro was, they were propelled into the
"otherspace" region, leaving a blinding flash of blue light
behind them.
	The Hover Units, not equiped with warp drive or the accelerated
time-reaction circuitry necessary to avoid the cliff, were not
so fortunate.  A gargantuan thermonuclear explosion erupted from
the cliff, converting much of it and the immediate area into
plasma.  The multipule lethal energies spread out at various
rates:  the radiation (both electromagnetic and nuclear), and
the blast wave.  Understandably, no physical evidence of the
Hover Units themselves survived.
	From a safe distance high in Mobius' atmosphere, David and
Dulcy viewed the spectacle, noting that there were now three
less of the advanced vehicles to be of any threat to a Freedom
Fighter in the future.  However, the problem still remained
prominent, not being erased by the loss of the technology.  It
retained importance, more so now than ever.
	"Whoa," Dulcy breathed out with relief as she saw the cloud
slowly expand into the sky and along the ground, "I'm glad
THAT'S over with."  She directed her vision toward the black and
gray fox hovering beside her.  "Is it, David?" she inquired,
still feeling somewhat shaken by the incidents involved near the
fringe of the Dark Mountain area.
	To her dismay, David shook his head as if to say "no".  "I
regret to inform you otherwise, Dulcy.  I believe that we will
be seeing more from those particular Hover Unit models in the
near future.  Not to mention that the attack was no accident."
	"But who would do such a thing?" the dragon demanded.
	David cringed visibly at the thought of reporting the
information to his female comrade, and turned his head away. 
Around his muzzle, the gray fur began to look a little grayer
than usual.  The data was so petrifying in its fearful nature
that even David was signifigantly affected by it.  Dulcy
examined her close friend with concern bordering on despair. 
This was the first time that she had ever seen David react in
that fasion, and she didn't care for the possible reasons that
might explain why he did.  As she considered the possibilities
herself, she began to vaguely comprehend why.
	After regaining a degree of his composure,  he slowly spat out,
"It seems...that the reports...of...  Packbell's death...were
greatly exagerated."  He returned his gaze toward Dulcy, and saw
that she regarded him with undivided attention and understanding.
	"But..." the dragon asked, knowing that David wouldn't be able
to answer the question either, "how could that be?  We all
thought that he went down with the Doomsday Project."
	"I can't answer that any better than you can.  But the point is
moot now, because Packbell is still alive.  As for the rest of
it..." he trailed off, informing Dulcy of exactly what his
sensors detected.
	Dulcy quivered with dread after the compuorganic vulpine had
finished relaying the data to her.  "You know, the Dark
Mountains is the perfect place for Packbell to hang out. 
Matches his personality."  She glared intensely toward the
general direction of the Dark Mountains.  "There's something
else you might want to know, David."
	The fox looked at the dragon in a questioning way, not needing
to ask verbally.
	"You might not know about the 'other side' of Dark Mountains,"
she continued, "since you probably concentrated more on the
geological part, knowing you."  She gave him a small grin, then
quickly reverted to a serious and frightful demeanor.  "That
place is the symbol of horror and the 'dark side' to every
culture on Mobius.  Even the very clouds around it seem to have
an evil in them.  They block out nearly all the light and cover
the entire area with darkness, as if they help the mountains and
protect them from every good thing from entering.  There's many
theories why this part of Mobius is still evil.  Some say that
it's where an animal or something else died, and it became a bad
sprit.  Others say that its a naturally evil place, something
that formed when the good forces on Mobius weren't looking. 
Whatever the reason, there's something there, and it has killed.
 Many have ventured in, but only one, a dragon, has come out. 
He came out...in pieces."
	With that final statement, David felt a wave of terror and
sickness wash over him.  His gray fur around his muzzle began to
seem MUCH grayer than usual, the underlying skin visibly
displaying the wordless message of how he felt about this new
element in his otherwise "sterile" knowledge of the oldest known
area on Mobius.  A peculiar feeling began threatening an uprise
in his stomach and throat, and he slowly rubbed his neck in
response, as if forcing it to remain in its place.  As if the
very information was intent on sending him to his death for
penalty of intruding into evil incarnate, his tails began to
falter in their rotation, giving gravity more opprotunity to act.
	Dulcy noticed the effects her monolouge had on her companion,
knowing that he had considered everything that she had said in
detail.  Gently grasping onto the vulpine, she held him close to
her.  "It's OK, David.  I'm still here, and I'm not going to let
the evil take you."  When that failed to quiet his horror, she
softly sang to him to calm him down.
	As the music gradually took its effect on David, he felt his
strength and inner resolve return.  "Look at me, Dulcy," he
dicated when he could speak again.  "I'm usually the one who is
notorious for looking at the logical and scientific aspect of
the universe.  Now, for me to react in this way when presented
with this...fokelore, for lack of a more accurate term, I...I
have behaived unfavorably."  He averted his gaze from his
friend, deeply embarrassed and at a loss for words.
	The dragon lightly stroked his head in a gesture of love and
understanding.  "I know, David.  But this could mean
something...that you've become more alive than you realize. 
This is the first time you've shown fear about something, I
mean, REALLY shown fear.  I mean the kind of fear that makes
even the best of us freeze, the kind that leaves you standing
there without a way to fight back.  Packbell and the Dark
Mountains has a way of doing that to us."
	The fox responded seriously, "Then, in that event, I have been
educated.  All of my technology...couldn't even begin to
compensate for the debilitating terror I felt."  He looked back
toward Dulcy, a renewed determination present in his eyes. 
"Everything else that has been occuring at Knothole does have a
degree of importance, but this should be our most IMMEDIATE
concern.  From what I project, Packbell could attack very soon,
I would say within the next three days.  Considering his
apparent readiness, he is near the point of what could easily be
a full-scale invasion in a limited amount of time."
	Dulcy nodded as she reviewed the information that her comrade
gave to her about the base deep inside the Dark Mountains.  But
she felt as if there was something missing in his speech,
something he needed to say.  Watching David closely, she gently
urged him on, encouragingly.
	"There's more to this...and I don't believe you will care for
the possibility any more than I do.  We were wrong about
Packbell.  We could be facing a similar situation with Snively,
or even Robotnik.  If that is the case, then Packbell may not be
our sole concern."  After a minute of consideration, he said,
"My long-range sensor array will be upgraded to allow for
detecting specific objects.  If they are anywhere on Mobius, I
WILL locate them."  Looking toward the general location of the
Dark Mountains, he continued, "This way we will be able to avoid
any future unfavorable circumstances, such as..."  He pointed to
where he was looking, no further explanation required to
illustrate his point.  "I regret to inform you, Dulcy, but I
believe the situation demands that we postpone the landing
instruction for now."
	His associate groaned derisively, but nodded in understanding. 
As the dragon pondered the events of the past morning, she
wondered how she would perform at Knothole after executing only
one practice landing.  She didn't have much time to think about
it, for six seconds later they shot into FTL space.

	While the two Freedom Fighters were airborne and revising
mission plans, a non-flight capable android paced the floor
inside his Command and Control Center of the Dark Mountains
base, contemplating what had transpired over the climatic
minutes involving the intruders.  He considered possibilities
there were that would allow a mere eleven year-old fox and
adolesent dragon to destroy the security technology in part of
the perimeter, not to mention outwit his Hover Unit pilots in
the valley.  After deep thought and situation analysis, his mood
only darkened further.  There was no logical explanation for how
an organic fox and dragon could perform those feats with any
reasonable degree of safety.  Unless...
	'What if,' Packbell thought to himself, 'one of them is NOT
organic?  An android like myself...or another form of artificial
life that could...'  He paused as his positronic matrix accessed
the image data that he saw from the security video displays. 
His eyes narrowed as he tried to resolve this new puzzle in his
mind.  'Yes,' he continued, 'that would explain everything. 
That would explain why he was able to deflect the laser, fire an
energy weapon at the laser arrays, and outfly three of my Hover
Units.  Now, what about the sensors...'
	Turning to the main computer, he ordered, "Computer, replay
data from the time the intruders were first sighted, to their
escape.  Show sensor and video downloads."
	The computer quietly complied with the demands Packbell made to
it.  Within less than a few seconds, the video display showed
the information taken from both the camera units and passive
electromagnetic detection grids.  The android thought over the
data, annotating something he saw at the beginning and end of
the scan.
	'Interesting,' he thought, 'there's plenty of IR radiation,
plus other indicators, from the dragon.  As for that black and
gray two-tailed fox...nothing.  No clue that he's there.  He's
invisible to every scan except the visible light detectors, and
that means I would have to know where to look for him.  Plus he
has some other technology:  shields, an energy weapon, and some
unknown type of propulsion that creates a blue light emission
when engaged.'  He considered the problem further, then when no
answer was forthcomming, he thought about who could have been
responsible for creating such an advanced artificial intelegence
such as that fox.
	"Draftwood," he muttered to himself, and his anger index rose
as every millisecond passed.  "That raccoon has been more
detrimental to my plans than I can calculate, but this time,
he's really broken his previous limits."  The android stood by
his command chair, unconsciously balling his hands into fists
and exposing his palms repeatedly in frustration.  "If I ever
get a hold of you...you and your puppet will be destroyed. 
That's a promise, Draftwood..."
	After his last statement, he froze in place, reconsidering his
threat.  An evil grin slowly slid across his face as his
tactical knowledge resolved an alternate method of dealing with
Bookshire's innovative toy.  The more he thought about it, the
more he liked it.
	"No," he said to himself with determination.  "I'll persuade
that vulpine to join forces with me, and bring Mobius down,
groveling at my feet!  He would be a powerful ally, if he can be
turned from his concerns of the Freedom Fighters."
	He started chuckling, which gradually graded into an evil
laughter which echoed throughout the base.  For now, his losses
seemed trivial, for he had found someone who would more than
compensate for them.  What the vulpine had to offer would no
doubt surpass everything in what Packbell considered to be
ultramodern technology, and it was imperative that he got his
hands on the tactical systems soon.  While he laughed, he
concocked a plan to snare the fox and convert him to his evil
influence.  On a whim, after he had calmed down to a significant
degree, he asked the computer about information involving
advanced modes of propulsion...

* * *

	As David and Dulcy traveled through the featureless void of
warp space, multiple systems integrated their functions in a
coordinated effort to maintain the required safety standards. 
His navigational deflector plowed a controlled ridge of
gravitons hundreds of kilometers ahead, sweeping any potential
objects that would otherwise endanger the welfare of the two
Freedom Fighters.  Beta graviton density sensors and graviton
emitters moderated the dispersal of the graviton warp field, and
prevented any unfavorable interactions with the planet's
gravitational forces.  Internal structural reinforcement and
inertial compensation fields stabolized the induced stresses on
his body.
	However, out of all this and more, David only paid as much
attention to the operations of the systems as a Terran elephant
would give to a speck of dust.  His primary concern was vested
in the refinement of his long-range sensor array, and his
nanites worked hard at their labors to give the vulpine the
configuration he needed.  The resolution increased over time,
giving him more and more data from the array.  He stopped
overseeing the download results when something very large,
metallic, and unpleasent appeared in the image translators.
	At first, the black and gray fox was shocked with denial, but
there was no mistaking what he had detected.  David directed
himself and Dulcy down to six meters above ground level, fifty
kilometers away from the refined mass of metal he noticed in the
scans.  He gradually bled the graviton warp field down to
minimize the threat of detection, then flew into an area
approximately three kilometers from the target to show his
dragon comrade what he had found.
	Dulcy gasped in disbelief and rubbed her eyes, to try and wipe
the gargantuan nightmare of a hallucination away.  It was still
there.
	Robotropolis.
	The dragon turned to face her vulpine friend. 
"David...that's...IMPOSSIBLE.  How could...I mean, how is
it...?"  She said nothing further, feeling as if her tounge was
somehow secured to her teeth.
	"One word, Dulcy," the fox said, breaking the silence,
"Snively."
	His associate stared at him, as if in hope that what he had
said was nothing more than a cruel excuse for a joke.  The stare
he returned was in confirmation...of the other, more undesired
truth.
	After running a complete sensor sweep of the confines of the
city, he noticed a particular area, about the size of a city
block, had a kind of stealthy aspect to him.  He then
concentrated his scans in an attempt to gain more information. 
None was forthcomming.  The compuorganic vulpine glared in the
general direction of the suspect area, unselfconsiously curling
his index finger in and out from his paw as he stared.  His
tails dropped perpendicular to his body and began to swish from
side to side, making his anger and frustration that much more
apparent.
	Noticing David's change from perturbation to anger, Dulcy
asked, "What's wrong?"
	"There's a sensor dampening field in the city," he replied,
"and I'm concerned about what could be under that field.  Every
type of probe I've utilized so far has proven useless.  The only
way..."
	A significantly long and uncomfortable pause followed.  Both
dragon and fox considered the option left open, but neither of
the two were very enthousastic about the prospect.  A decision
had to be made...
	And the one in command made it.  "Dulcy," David commanded,
"wait here.  I'm going into the city limits to investigate."  He
opened the dragon's ruck sack and searched through it, his paws
attempting to locate the device he knew his comrade would need. 
After finding it, he pulled the device from the ruck sack and
handed it to her.  "This is a transceiver," he explained.  "It
should keep us in contact with each other, although I am unable
to gurantee its effectiveness when I enter the area surrounded
by the dampening field.  Regardless of whatever happens, if you
don't hear anything from me in the next twenty minutes, assume
the worst and return to Knothole immediately."
	His female comrade nodded in understanding, but that didn't
hide the concerned look visible in her muzzle and eyes.
	"I know.  I don't care for the potential outcome any more than
you do...but one of us has to return to Knothole if something
goes wrong."
	A sigh from the dragon, indicating her reluctance to let her
associate take the risks.  "Just one thing, David," she
admonished, "you're NOT expendable, by anyone's interpretation."
	The fox nodded in understanding, then hugged his friend
supportingly for about half a minute.  He then rushed off into
the distance, his stealth characteristics making him
undetectable against the background of rocks almost immediately.
	Dulcy crossed her fingers and marked time, waiting and hoping
that her friend would return safetly.

	On his approach to Robotropolis, David noticed that the air
gradually became more and more poluted as the distance between
himself and the city decreased.  He cringed a little at the
stench and engaged his air filtration systems.  The metallic
nightmare loomed closer and closer, a contrast to the Great
Forest microcosm that the vulpine knew and loved.  Anger
threatened to well up in his mind as he looked the monster
straight in the eyes...
	'No...' he thought to himself, 'I have a mission to perform,
and that's what I will concentrate on.  Regardless of my
personal feelings, I'm not allowing them to gain control of my
judgement faculties.'  After spending a few microseconds
repeating the mantra to his more emotional side, the threat of
blinding anger subsided, and he continued forward to begin his
investigation.  Managing to find an area that wasn't being
patrolled by SWATBots or other forms of security monitoring, he
sped toward the city limits and beyond.
	And groaned inwardly at what he saw.  Structures stood as
manevolent metallic spires against the perpetual black and red
sky, towering over him and seeming to build to infinity.  The
black and dark gray colors contrasted with the more familiar and
softer organic greens and browns of David's home.  There were
some green and brown spots on the ground, spreading off into the
distance, but it didn't take a mass spectrometer and organic
analysis to notice that those spots were not rich with life. 
Lightning and some acidic rain poured down from the tortured
sky, as if the biosphere was fighting in vain against the
metallic beast it covered.  In short, not exactly a place to
have an enjoyable vacation, let alone take residence in.
	David slowly and unknowingly backed himself to a wall, the only
thought in his mind being directed by a primal urge to escape
from the evil claws and teeth of the monster.  On contact with
the cold metallic wall, he leaped with a combination of fright
and surprise.  Having enough sense of mind to keep quiet, he
came close to shreeking, but drove that impulse away in time. 
Leaning against the wall, he closed his eyes, and breathed in
and out slowly, in an effort to control his quaking nerves. 
After doing so and berating himself for his inexcusable
behaivor, he turned to the cormer of the building to close the
distance to the area of the sensor dampening field.
	He froze in his position when he heard a noise.  It was fairly
far off, 300 meters away...but in the general vicinity of his
target.  Footsteps...not the slow and measured gait of a
SWATBot, but something less predictable and off any measure of
perfect timing.  Other noises appeared, the metallic and
measured clanks on the ground indicating SWATBots, and an
unidentified type of vehicle.  Deciding to take a new route to
see what the dampening field covered, David located a ladder and
scaled his way up to the top level of the building.  Racing
toward his target, he leaped across the gaps between the
structures until he came close enough to his destination to
observe the events.
	A brief flash filled his field of view and an unpleasent
disorientation on the verge of being nausiating spread like a
wave over his sensor array.  The fox cringed with the effort to
maintain command of his senses, putting a paw over his neck in
blind hope to quell the sickening feeling.  Failing at that, he
engaged his shields, forcing the sickness away.  When his head
cleared again, he realized what had happened:  a malfunction in
the containment field of the sensor dampening energy generator
caused the radius of the steathy dome to expand, and (literally)
hit him in the face.
	'Looks as if I will require consideration of more shielding in
the future,' David thought to himself.  'I'm going to be fairly
useful if I can't even function properly.'  An inward
half-hearted chuckle at the blatent sarcasm in the personal
remark, then he returned his undivided attention to the task at
hand.  'That sensor dampening field is pretty odd...not
conformant to anything we thought was current Robotropolis
technology.  Subspace signatures all over the spectrum, plus
some variations in RF phasing...which would explain why I
couldn't detect anything outside the field.  Even SWATBots would
require heavy shielding just to be able to function here.  Where
Snively obtained technology like that is anyone's guess.'
	Directing his gaze downward, he saw what he had heard a minute
before.  The source of the noises came from Snively, a pair of
SWATBot guards, and a small vehicle with tank-like tracks on the
bottom.  On the vehicle itself was a metallic cylinder,
containing something for certain, but what was another matter
all together.
	"What is our current condition?" Snively asked in his nasal
voice to the guards.
	"We will be well prepared, sir," the metallic grating of voice
synthesis responded.  "New power station energy cores under
gamma test procedures, interconnects to the main power grids
expected to be completed at 2200 hours tomorrow.  Advanced
Technology Center currently in service, HoverUnit upgrades
available within the next two days.  Current numbers at present:
 10,000 SWATBots, 1100 WorkerBots, 1600 HoverUnits with an equal
number of-"
	A quick sweep of Snively's finger across his neck indicated his
desire for silence.  "Good...we can stage an attack within this
week now...and regain the control we had before."  Snively
stared off into space in a peculair fassion, letting an evil
grin contort his face.  "Oh...if only you were here,
Julian...but you're not, and I am."  Holding the smile while
looking directly at the guards, he commanded, "Take the
experiment to the Alpha Quadrant power plant site.  I want it to
start receiving power the second the power plant is available,
so that we can begin our assalt in the next four days."
	"Yes, sir," came the compliance from the guards as they
saluted.  The guards then entered the vehicle and drove off to
the power plant, taking the unidentified device with them.
	Watching the vehicle depart with a measure of grim
satisfaction, Snively turned and walked into the building where
the dampening field generator was located.  He thought to
himself, 'We'll see how good those Freedom Fighters are when I
put them to work in the cold weather.  That should slow the
hedgehog down considerably.'
	David watched from his vantage point, a grim look warping his
muzzle.  'That's all I need to know,' he thought.  'Time to
return to Dulcy and Knothole...this is a very precarious
situation we have, indeed.'
	The sound of metal striking metal interrupted his thoughts. His
eyes went wide with fear as he realized what that sound was:  a
small squad of SWATBots slowly climbing up a stairwell. 
Regaining his thoughts again, he took stock of his situation. 
There was no place to hide on the roof of the structure, and
every direction around him had an equal risk for his detection. 
For aside from the SWATBots scaling the steps to the roof, there
was also a large circle of HoverUnits...and he was at the center
of a circle that was gradually closing in on itself.
	'How in the...oh yes.  They must have found a hole in the
sensor dampening field.  And my shield created a pretty sizable
hole.  And if they're here...that means they are shielded, and
using optical sensors only.'  Casting a glare to his offenders
around him, he drew power to his phasers and warp drive.  The
compuorganic vulpine waited until he could see his airborne
assailants in the visible light spectrum, then waited for a
period of time longer so that he could be absolutely certain he
could properly disable or destroy them.  Turning toward a
HoverUnit group, he openned fire on them.  The results sent the
group of HoverUnits on a new course:  to impact with the ground.
	Directing his attention to the other HoverUnit groups, he
opened fire on them as well, converting them to useless
conglomerates of plastic, glass, electronics, and metal.  He
quickly looked around again, searching for more targets.  He was
rewarded by the approach of a large circle of HoverUnits, which
flew into his vicinity, their laser emitters discharging lethal
beams of light.  The vulpine's shield was able to take the full
force of the firepower, but for him to remain in the area too
much longer would increase the odds against his favor. 
Apparently, the SWATBot troops and HoverUnit pilots knew that as
well as he did.
	In the tense situation, David half-heard a door open about
twenty meters behind him.  Narrowing his eyes and glacing over
his right shoulder long enough to see what he was up against, he
uncovered the graviton warp field emitters on his tails.  The
blue light from his tails gradually intensified as the beta
graviton field density increased.  Considering what he was up
against, he performed some recalculations on the field volume.
	'If they all want me to surrender, I will give them what they
want...only not in the way they expect.'  Checking his internal
chronometer, his calculated that his warp engagement would
happen in ten seconds.  He turned his body around, looking at
the SWATBot squad with a bold defiant glare on his face.
	"Freeze, prisoner!  You are under arrest!" the SWATBot squad
leader demanded, pointing its laser rifle at the intruder.  It
stepped forward, giving David the hint of not to try anything
foolish.
	The commander was rewarded with a retort from the fox. 
"Correction:  YOU are under arrest."  With that response came a
somewhat more powerful one, as a sphere of blue light formed
over the roof of the building, then reshaped into a wide streak
as David flew off into warp space.  

	At her position three kilometers outside the Robotropolis city
limits, Dulcy continued marking time and waited.  She began to
worry when her wrist chronometer begain counting pass the point
of nineteen minutes, thinking that something had happened to her
vulpine friend.  Lacking anything better to do for that last
minute, she rubbed her footpaws into the ground, displacing dirt
and pebbles as she did so.
	'Come on, David,' she privately urged her companion.  'Don't
make me go without-'
	An interruption in her thoughts as she noticed something in her
peripheral vision.  A band of blue light erupted from
Robotropolis, leaving an array of colors behind as the beta
graviton energy gradually weakened and vanished.  Her eyes
narrowed reflexively to filter out the light as the band came
closer and closer.  A few seconds later, the blue streak
exploded into a large blue flash about 100 meters ahead of her,
and she saw a black and gray form fly down toward her location.
	When David landed beside her, she picked him up and hugged him
tightly to her chest.  "Oh David, it's so good to see you again.
 I was getting worried."
	The fox smiled, returning the embrace to his dragon comrade. 
"I nearly thought I wouldn't return here alive, but I did." 
Remembering that his departure to their vantage point was
visible, he said in a more serious tone, "It's imperative that
we leave immediately.  You more than likely saw how I escaped
from Robotropolis, and I wouldn't be surprised if the security
network did as well."
	As if on que, a group of ten HoverUnits flew out of
Robotropolis.  Directly toward the two Freedom Fighters.
	David glared at the arrivals, his mind running through every
possible action to take.  Making the decision, he enveloped
himself and Dulcy in a warp field and darted off two seconds
later to the safer regions of Mobius, specifically Knothole.
	Thwarted of their prey, the HoverUnits changed course and
returned to their flight docks without incident.  The fate of
the pilots, however, would not be so plesant.

* * *

	Bookshire walked unhurriedly toward David's and Tails' hut, his
pace belying what his mind was running through.  A mixture of
concern, confusion, and a minor degree of frustration warped his
mouth.  His thoughts were on a certain fox that he and Rotor had
created just a few months before.
	'I'm happy to see that David got as far as he has in this short
period of time,' his personal deliberatory side said.  'He
became a close and caring brother to Tails, and I'm sure that
Tails feels the same way about him.  He's a good friend to
nearly everyone in Knothole, last I've heard.  Sonic and Sally
officially made him a Freedom Figher Commander last month, and
I'm still a bit surprised he turned down Sonic's offer to become
THE commander for Knothole.  I suppose he'd rather work with us;
rather than over us.'  A slight private chuckle echoed through
his mind, then returned to the more serious demeanor. 
'Yet...something still worries me...what does he feel about ME?'
	His unbalanced gait continued, until he paced up the steps to
the hut and gave the door four short taps.  In the back of his
mind he heard a series of quick propelling stomps on the floor
ahead of him, which was rather unusual comming from the
inhabitants of the hut...unless something was wrong.  A few
short breaths came from the area right behind the door, then the
door nearly flew off its hinges as it opened inward.
	Seeing the perturbed vulpine standing before him, Bookshire
asked kindly, "What's wrong, Tails?"
	Tails panted a bit more before he managed to speak.  When he
had enough of a breath to do so, he dictated in a severely
concerned tone, "Bookshire...David's transponder...I just lost
the signal.  One second it was there, then it was gone! 
Something bad's happened to him, and I don't know what!"
	The raccoon carefully stooped down, being especially cautious
of his injured leg.  He rubbed a comforting paw on Tails'
headfur, looking as calmly as he could into the frightened fox's
eyes.  "Show me what panel the transponder data is uploaded
to...maybe I can help."
	Tails nodded and led Bookshire over to the touchpad panel in
question.  The raccoon promptly scanned over it, looking for a
key or sequence of keys that would allow access to the greater
volume of data that was transmitted along with the transponder
signal.  After a few seconds, he located the required key and
lightly tapped it once.  He then searched through the data
history downloads, looking for a clue as to what caused the
sudden break in the signal.
	"Aha," he said, finding the suspect time, location, and
information.  "David was caught somewhere in a sensor dampening
field.  According to this, he went to investigate something at
these coordinates..." he said, pointing the indicator out to
Tails, "...and a malfunction of the confinement beam in the
generator caused the field radius to expand is suspected. 
Something about these coordinates though...seem very familiar,
yet I can't put a finger on where right now."
	"Is..is...he going to be...alright?" the perturbed fox
stammered.
	Bookshire shook his head, uncertainty in his eyes.  "I honestly
can't say...the only form of heavy protection that David has
right now is his graviton shield.  As long as that's active, he
should be relatively safe.  That of course depends on where he
is...blast!  If I could only remember where..."
	A few minutes of silence passed, and both companions became
more and more distressed by the second.  No further response
from the transponder came.  With a grim look on the raccoon's
muzzle, he reached toward a communications panel to call Sally.
	Something flashed in his peripheral vision, a small white point
on the transponder data panel.  Pulling his paw away from the
communications panel while he looked down for a better view of
the download screen, Bookshire smiled in relief.  Tails looked
at his raccoon friend with puzzlement written over his
face...then down at the transponder downloads.  A smile
gradually spread across his face as well.
	"Alright!" the fox cheered, jumping up into the air a few
times.  "He's out!"
	The raccoon smiled deeply, still keeping his eyes on the data. 
"Hhmm...he's in warp space, and heading toward a particular
location...now he's stopped near Dulcy."  Twenty seconds passed,
then he said, "They're both in warp space now, evading a
HoverUnit group...and heading toward Knothole...should be here
any second.  Come on Tails, let's go see them."

	Looking over the meadow and sky from the Knothole border, Sally
glanced at her wrist chronometer worriedly.  'It's been about an
hour and fifteen minutes since David and Dulcy left,' she
thought.  'Didn't think it would take THAT long for them to run
a scan and practice landings...unless something went wrong.'
	Scanning the sky again, a pinprick of light caught her eye.  A
second later, it exploded into a blue flash, which gradually
faded into a small black speck.  As it grew, Sally saw that it
was David and Dulcy on their return home.  Others noticed the
flash as well, and the assembly crowded around Sally to watch.
	Tense seconds passed on the ground as the airborne pair flew
closer.  Expecting Dulcy's usual landing, the group prepared for
the ground-wrenching crash.  Dulcy flew in closer and
closer...and made a perfect touchdown.
	Sally ran over to give congratulations to Dulcy, but noticed a
concerned look on her friends faces.  "What's wrong?"
	"Sally...we've got a problem...big problem."  David answered.

I just got to ask here! Hey did you also make a Sonic doom patch?

GOD about one year ago, I was the Sonic hater of the year.. I wanted to
mangle and torture and implode that blue blighter.. I raytraced a Sonic doom
title, spent hours at friends houses trying to get clips for the game. I
tortured my friend into drawing frames of Sonic.. which took my at least a
week to convert to doom. 
I bought a Video Blaster Se100.
Digitised 55high density disks of AVI's, from it got the frames for Tails,
got more violent.. 

And then, one day I got access to the internet. I searched for Sonic. 
What I found was a site called "Bookshires Page".. I though to
myself.."hahah so there's a lot of them out there, people I can hurt!"

I downloaded a story: Temporal Syndrome by Shawn Wolski.

I began reading it, hoping that Sonic would get hurt, or something.
At the end of the story Sonic died... My mind was unable to cope with this,
the whole time I'd been hoping for him to peg.. and now.. well. now.. 

Hey Shawn that Temporal Syndrome of yours is the best I have read! 
ThanX

I downloaded more stories, began writing Rl10.. 

And here I am.. 180degrees flipped out.. I've lost my "Normal" attribute.

Cheers
Ablater

Cool Bro, Yeah, I got the wolfie source already.. though I couldn't make
head or "Tails" of it.. I program in Pascal and Asm, so that C stuff.. while
I can 
understand it.. is less than natural to me. At the moment, I am updating my
LTS sound system to support the AWE32.. AHHAHAHAH!

About copyrights, God help us.. We're going to need a miracle.. As soon as
you send them any mail. They're going to see only two words.. no matter how
far you space them apart: Sonic, Game. 

Though the game will not really be based so much on our blue spiked friend,
but more on the Mobian freedom fighters themselves.. Who we the players will
be converted to. [ZZZTTT.. NO! NOT THE PLAYERIZER!]
I should probably do the talking to SEGA, it would be easier for me to
convey the idea.. But still, hey.. I'm open to suggestions. 

Oh, and by the way.. those nasty pics. If any of you thought that SEGA are
warm hearted.. think again.. ambitious! You know what they did to Julius
Caesar in the Shakespear play when he got ambitious? 
Well, let me say is this way rather:

Due to a business alliance with Sega and distibuters in the small country of
South Africa. Very few South Africans have heard of the Super Nintendo game
machine, as such these game machines are not even available as of yet in
South Africa, and Sega continues to sell the Mega Drive and 16 bits cartridges.

Yups, no one here even knows what a SNES is! So SEGA are going to push it
with Microsoft soon for planet Domination.

Oh, did I say something bad.. sorry.. wasn't me.. was my schitzo personality.

Cheers
Marken Psantis [I want control of the body next!]

Hmmm, Well, as of lately I've seen a few samurai kittens, but no Ninjas, in
fact the ninja part was just a joke. So stop freaking out and thinking that
I'm pointing at you.. Okay? [DIE DIE DIE! hehe]

But on the serious side, we all do add our own chracters, usually these

"Reinforcements!" muttered Sally as the teams of SWAT-bots came charging in,

There exists in life a limit for humour, violence and logic.
Fortunately I haven't found the violence one yet.

This isn't the first time...
On AOL they give you free FTP space, and I put naked pictures of Kerri
Hoskins (she played Sonya in MK3 (THE GAME, NOT THE MOVIE) and about 3 days
ago I tried to log in, and it said "invalid account". I called AOL and they
told me because of those pics, my account has been cancelled and there is no
way I can get it back. End of story.

Ok, that wasn't at all Sonic related, but I figured this is a good place to
spam about how AOL deals with that kind of stuff. No warnings, just CLICK,
and you're gone FOREVER.

Aaah, the wonder of Windoze. Yes, this is an example of people for you, ainit..
They'd rather kill you than have a chat.. probably because if they did have
one we would dominate them with our logic.

I've not seen all that many pics from the defunct perv directory, but
those I have seen are a lot less raunchier than some of the TTBS images
I've seen.  Warner Bros. and Time-Warner seem to be a lot more tolerant of
such uses of their characters; after the "Please, Please, Please, Get a
Life" short on "Animaniacs" (including the Minerva poster), I'd say it's a
near certainty they are aware of all the TTBS and TTLS pics and stories
out there.  The enormous financial resources of Time Warner could use the
court system to wipe out places like the acme and TTA Web pages almost as
fast as Sonic can get from the huts to the power ring pool. 

Of course, Sega is a different company with its own agenda, and we should 
at least be thankful they aren't as anti-'net as I've heard Paramount and 
Disney are.

While walking to work yesterday, I came up with ideas that, if 
implemented, could potentially make Sega's PR staff work overtime.  If 
removal of the porn and violent pics is the end of the matter, these 
ideas will be discarded and never divulged.  There is a certain alt.* 
newsgroup that helps bring forth many interesting ideas ("2600" is not a 
part of its name).

Can't live with the consequences of their own decision, eh?  If they want 
to play hardball with Sonic fans who are also their clientele, they'll 
just have to let the chips fall where they may.  If you don't want to be 
thought of as a bully, don't be one.  Amazing that such a simple concept 
is so difficult to grasp.

Not First Ammendment.  It's not Congress trying to stop our Sonic fun.. yet.
It's a matter of Title 17 United States Code (Copyright Act of 1976).  
Though the 1976 law provides for new technologies in a way much superior 
than its predecessors, the legislators of the time could not have 
anticipated the advent of the current state of personal computer 
technology (at least it occurring so relatively soon), and the current 
code does not adequately address matters concerning 'net use of protected 
material.  We are at the mercies of the vagaries of court decisions until 
the 1976 law is superseded, and I doubt Congress will get around to that 
any time soon.
 
> I don't know enough about the legal issues.

I have had a course in copyright law and another in contract law for the 
music industry, but these aren't enough for me to be pro se in court and 
still be able to stand my ground.

We'll just have to wait and see, and hope the porn/violent pics is as far 
as they go.

The Copyright Act almost agrees.  You own the story or picture you made 
to the extent of the added material in such a derivative work, even if 
the court decides the work as a whole infriges and/or is obscene.  But 
you still have no claim whatsover to the parts not yours.  The use of 
Sega's characters is, in legal terms, enough to let them quash fan fiction.

Sega could now set a precedent that would affect A!, TTA, and other 
fandom.  I don't have reliable access to Usenet anymore, but I would 
encourage others on the list to discuss this issue in their favorite 
Usenet groups (but don't violate the charter of whatever group(s) you 
post to about Sega v. Sonic Fandom).

That's the correct attitude to take.  I hope you saved that email.

I can understand your concern.  But "Bob"dammit, this sort of thing makes
me mad!  They have a legal, but not a moral right to do this.  Your page
has given them more business than not, and an overwhelming amount of the
materials on your page are corporation-approved.

I'll pull some strings and call some favors for ya, Rat, if you so desire. 
I think I could get you a page in Germany or Finland, where their 
juristiction is weaker.  That, or an discreet ftp site.

*chuckles* Geez. ;) I was KIND of like that. I used ot think the whole
thing about Sega and Sonic the Hedgehog was so freaking stpid. One day I
was sitting in class, chattign to some friends about some of the good ol'
shows that used ot be on, liek Fat Albert, Transformers, etc. etc. One
speaks up askign if anyone watched the Sonic show on the weekends, and i'm
like "They did WHAT!? They actually wasted their time making a SHOW of the
blue freak? THIS I haveta see and laugh at." Whelp, that weekend I flip the
TV on, watched HArmonic Sonic, ans was hooked. I shuted up about Sonic and
started to even record the shows now. Go fig. <G> WHen I REALLY started to
enjoy the show was when the second season came out. They really outdid
themselves compared ot the last season.

In my personal opinion, we are not actually dealing with Sega itself, but a
few isolated nobody party-killers. According to what I have heard, about
whoevers Email not even being configured right, whoever contacted Rat didn't
belong to the PR devision.. or Sega is week in the net PR devision.

The second thing we see is that it took 3 message mailings before SEGA would
send email.. this almost confirms it to me that whoever sent this, or did
this was some fool, somewhere who gave themself a little ego rush, from
charging in the wrath of big powerful SEGA.

Basicall, Rat should contact SEGA, as if the main pictures can be put up,
and ask if the porn fanfic can be put up too. You may find that they'll
agree, and that the only reason we took flak was become some mommy working
at sega caught her little angel in a naughty area.. heheh

Yeah, I used to be someone who fit the description of "Nintendo Moron" a
few years ago...then I actually PLAYED Sonic.  It just goes to prove a
philosophy of mine: Don't insult something until you've
seen/heard/played/otherwise experienced it.

You got two right, at least: "Robot" and "from second-reality earth".  Of
course, who's to say it's second-reality and not sixty-fifth or
centillionth?  When there's an infinite number of realities, it's kinda
hard to number 'em all.

i agree that is insane! It looks to me that Sega is trying to be like

puting up there own sonic drawing.  Now I can agree about geting rid of

I'll tell ya what. If you can provide some space for the pics, I will put

Probably because it's one of those "If we let them get away with this, how

Just to clear this up, they called me on the phone. And I had to ask them 3
times (in the same conversation) to send it to me, and after saying "I won't
make you out to look like a bad guy". I should have just said "send me email,
or the pictures stay". Geez.

I think a lot of little angels would find their way in that area, so I think
it's best to leave the pictures down if I wanted there to be SOME chance of
being linked on their web pages.

My Mortal Kombat pages were added to Gamepro online, and almost instantly,
the popularity of those pages doubled. I would love to see my Sonic resource
page, and Bookshire's pages have that same fate. 
And like I said, I want to keep a good relationship with Sega if possible. I
find it works out better if you keep these people your friends, as stupid 
as they act sometimes.

If they ask me to take anything else down, I promise I'll announce it to 
this list, to the newsgroup, and I will delay as much as possible.

Of course I am not actually deleteing any of this. I'm just moving it
offline.

That's possible.  After all, I don't believe copyrights extend to parodies
(I mean, just look at how long MAD's been around), and if sick, perverse,
twisted pictures aren't parodies, I'd like somebody to tell me what is.

I'd say we all just gang up on Sega of America and tell them, "Look, we have
a roboticizer set to Full and we *desparately* need a Sonic fix.  For every
day you sit on your rear ends not working on a Sonic IV, we will roboticize
one of your employees and *make* them work on a Sonic IV.  I don't mean a
Sonic III, Part III (I refer to Sonic and Knuckles as 'Sonic III, Part II), I
mean a Sonic IV, with a Intel Pentimum 150mhtz processor, 256 colors, etc.
etc. etc."

Anybody want to join me?

Now hol' on there.  Why not Sonic IV for the 32X system?  They've already
infested it with a Knuckles game...however, I see your point.  Jazz
Jackrabbit's a poor substitute for Sonic.  However, it'd have to be fully
ray-traced, have a *200*mhz Pentium option, have 65,336 colors, and a
32-bit soundtrack.

Hey, if you're wishing, wish for something TRULY impossible.  ;)

If THIS is the case, I'd say we *blatently* continue to do it in a artistic
way of shoving our collective middle fingers in contempt for companies that
do such a thing!  I did the same thing to Disney when I created Jonathan
Brisby, a Generation X version of Mickey Mouse (yes, yes, he's named after a
Don Bluth film, but that's not the point).  He gets a cameo on BAM IV, and I
plan to write more stories for him in the future.

I'm not sure I understand any of this. I thought that it was legal to use
pictures of a copyrighted character as long as no money was involved.
Considering the fact that they told Ratman to remove only the "mature"
pictures suggests they hated the content, not the fact that he was using the
characters. Since the content was created by someone else, and was meant in
jest(Depending on your point of view), doesn't it qualify as a parody?
(Parodies are perfectly legal.) I also don't understand why Sega didn't
demand IN WRITING that you remove the material. (E-Mail counts as a signed
document now? Not from what I understand.....Based on other cases I've heard
about, one of Sega's lawyers should have contacted you by mail, NOT e-mail.)
This whole thing stinks. It just doesn't seem right or make any sense!

<nodnod> I also keep thinking to myself, too...that had it been my OWN

Sega... but they SHOULD have asked nicely, at least... and if nothing

As soon as I heard the news about SEGA's request for the removal of the
porno pics from rat.org, I took a quick look at a few copyright sites
on the Web, as one of my "regular" pictures is at rat.org.  I found out
about the "Fair Use" section of copyright law, which allows people to
use copyrighted stuff in a limited manor.  Though people can use it,
the original owner of the copyright has the right to remove anything
using their copyright if the material would produce a negative effect
on marketing for the company.

SEGA believed the porn pics were bad for marketing.  They had the
right to remove them.  I'm not interjecting any of my opinions
in this message--just saying that SEGA did have the right to remove
them, just as they have the right to remove my picture or anything
that even bears a resemblance to Sonic.

As with most laws, there is a fine line between the First Amendment
and Copyright Infringement.  I want to be able to draw my pictures of
Sonic and Sally and everyone else, and post them on the 'Net for
all to see, as that's my right.  Its also SEGA's right to remove
them if they deem them bad for marketing.  Lets hope this issue
doesn't get that far.

Alex,

So after discussing the comics, guess what comes to me in last
Saturday's mail?  Sonic #30!  Looks like the subscription finally
started.

I'll be mailing it to you today; barring any complications, you should
be getting it before the week is over.

I'd apologize for the delay but we have Archie Comics to "thank" for
that! :-)

Dan

Hmm, lemme see, a Pentium with VLBVGA can pump 19MB/S to the VGA, there
should be no problem getting 30FPS multi layered, perspective paralaxed 64K
Colour gameplay there.. 
32-Bit soundtrack, hmmm. <WHIMPER> Maybe 16-bit would do?

Hey, what's my game effort now? ARGHH! 
Hey, get these nifty preview sneaks.

42FPS on a AMDDX40, with non local bus VGA.
244FPS on a DX-4,100, with VLB.
the LTS Digital Music Sound System, 
surround Sound sound effects, 
10Bit GFX libaries.
256Colour flickerless MODEX system.
Input via Mouse, Keyboard, Joystick and GAMEPAD!
And, possibly something else...

There! Now, will some coder who knows about AWE32's please send in your
application.. 

Cheers

I got my #30 on Saturday, too, but I'm still waiting for some other 
comics I ordered in September.

That's a great idea, unfortunately, my Robotocizer is still not complete, as 
I need a particle accelarator and magnetic particle control unit. So if any one
has 15 kilometers of copper-wire spare, and a few years to wind it for me..
I'd be happy to build us one.. or as least make a neato particle accelarator
that would allow as to blow plains to dust with golfballs, and turn people
into soup with paint specks.. 

On the serious side, I have heard SEGA are going into PC's! Check out their
job list, they're looking for PC coders.. maybe after this Knothole game
incident is finished I should offer my services. ;-) 
Though they want BSEE's and crap.. arghh!

Hiya brother and sister furries!

Please read ALL this message, there is some important stuff at the end.

Let me start of with the apologies, my story "Cold-Deceptions" has a list of
things at the beginning, things that the story claims not to follow. 
I DIDN'T SAY THESE THINGS WERE WRONG!!!

For example, while reading a humourous story is great, Sometimes
mega-depressing stories are even better.. I know for one that Bloodlines,
Temporal Syndrome, the entire Tolouse storyline, etc. Were brilliant!
The whole series with Joseph in was brilliant, though not overly depressing,
which shows stories can be put in all ways. 
So go ahead, make your story depressing.. my RL10 Tortured Freedom. which I will
soon be releasing is happy, sad, depressing and humourous... Though perhaps you
won't like it.. it's a matter of taste.. let me put it this way.. a lot of those
points in Cold Decept--will burn Right into the Rl10 trilogy.

Adding charcters is not wrong either, though in my opinion, NOTE MY OPINION,
I don't like it when they become too powerfull, this is after all the Sonic
the Hedgehog area. An example of successful adding of characters in my
opinion was Tolouse.

Okay, 'nuff said..  

******************************************************************************

This is probably not the best place to put this, but I needed a way of telling a
good few people. If you want to chat to me about the Game Development, you can 
catch me at 20:00 International time, under my name: Ablater .. with 
the Internet Phone proggy at the site: iphone.interserv.com, or the first site
on the Iphone server list. I will be here on Friday and Satuday night too,
Oh ya, it's Monday here currently...

<Sorry for wasting bandwidth aunt Sally>

Speaking as the high muckety-muck keeper of the FAQ File:

Most of the freedom fighters are in their mid-teens.  It was established
in "Blast to the Past" that both Sonic and Sally were 5 years old when
Robotnik took over.  Further, in "Drood Henge," it specifically
mentioned that Sal was 16 and wouldn't "come of age" for another 2 years
-- 18 apparently being the age of majority.  Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine
also appeared as kids in BttP, so they would be contemporaries of Sonic
& Sally (i.e., roughly the same age).

Finally, Tails was described as 10 years old in the Drood Henge ep, so
he's definitely the youngster of the group.  There are no benchmarks for
Dulcy, BTW -- she's described as "adolescent" in her self-named ep, but
I don't know when dragons hit puberty.  ;-)

Too bad this isn't all there is to it; Archie Comics insists that Sonic
& Sally are really 15, which has been a major pain for your friendly FAQ
File custodian.  Worse, the comics once listed Tails' age as 5 -- WHERE
they got that from, I don't know -- but Scott Fulop managed to tap-dance
his way around that one in the Sonic Grams section of Sonic #29, citing
the effects of the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom ["Tails' Taste of Power,"
Sonic #14], claiming that it aged Tails by 5 years.  He didn't say
whether Tails realized that he was nekkid!

If you've seen "Harmonic Sonic" (it was on USA yesterday), did you notice 
the robots playing music?  Isn't that clearly a violation of Robotnik's 
laws as stated in the comics.

We've already had 2 or 3 discussions over what year it is on Mobius, and 
other things that are different between the weekend cartoon and the 
comics.  If someone is willing to compile a list of what's different 
between the Sonic worlds (books, Archie comics, Fleetway comics, weekend 
cartoon), I'll put it on the ftp site.  Or, this could go in one of the 
Sonic FAQ's.

It's a well-known rule of physics that plot developments only travel in
one direction. ;-)

You're right, it's something of a plot hole.  It would appear that Allee
and Hurst didn't get a chance to think it through in its entirety before
the show got cancelled.

Actually, every Thursday Sega holds a product review meeting for producers, 
marketing & licensing folks, and the executive staff.  I usually attend 
these meetings, but this past week I skipped it.  However, I heard that 
somebody brought up the issue of "mature themed" pictures on the Web site at 
the meeting, and the exec. staff directed our on-line people to look into 
it. Well, the rest is history...

No, we don't have people who just surf the net looking for these things.  We 
do have on-line reps, however, who scan mostly the rec.games.video.sega 
group, CompuServe & AOL, and maintain Sega's own WWW board.

By the way, Anne Jordan works in the Legal Department here at Sega.

I don't suppose any Sonic fan out there who has all the weekemd shows on
tape would be willing to make me copies? My local cable company stiffed us
out of most of the episodes over the past 2 years, and now they don't even
run repeats. Anyway, if someone would be willing to do this for me, I'd be
very, very happy. :)

	Music is a violation of Robotnik's rules. But then again, the music 
was being played on the SkySpy space station, miles out of Robotnik's reach. 
For the sake of discussion, if Robotnik was on the SkySpy, the robots 
would probably not play their music. 
	BTW. There was a similar instance in Star Trek 6. At the formal 
dinner on the Enterprise, the Klingons mentioned that Romulan Ale was 
illegal in the Federation. Kirk made a comment about "...one of the 
advantages being thousands of light years away." ;-)

I can give you two to start with. First - Tails' age. When he was 
introduced in Sonic 2, he was only 3. When the comic was started two 
years ago, he was 4 or 5. During the Adventures of Sonic cartoon, Tails 
was exactly 4 1/2. But, during one episode in the second season of the 
weekend Sonic (I don't recall the name, but it was the one that involved the 
Power Stones), Sally said he was 10. Later, the comics took notice and 
modified his age.
	The second discrepency - the real name of the walrus handyman. 
When he was introduced in the comic, his name was Boomer. But, when the 
weekend Sonic showed him, his name was Rotor. In issue #12 (Sonic's 
Christmas Carol), the comic officially changed his name to Rotor. They 
first used his new name in the story, then they gave an explanation about 
the name change in the SonicGrams section. They said they didn't want to 
create any conflicts with the TV show. (TOO LATE!!)

My own take on this is that you can blame it on the writer "du jour"
David Villaire.  During the show's first season, they literally had a
different writer for every ep.  It was only with the second season that
they settled on a single writing team headed by Pat Allee and Ben Hurst.
That kept the vision of Mobius somewhat more coherent.  The ban on music
I take to be a vestige of the "Adventures of..." syndicated series which
I hold to be of dubious canonicity (see below).

This situation was a mess!  I'd appreciate knowing the story and issue
("chapter and verse") for Tails' age in the comics, but the Sonic Grams
of #29 try to explain away the discrepancy by invoking Sonic #14 ("Tails'
Taste of Power") to explain how Tails could suddenly age 5 years.  BTW,
it was the "Drood Henge" ep that established Tails' age as 10, thus
demonstrating the acceptance of the SatAM series as canon.

Other discrepancies:

Perhaps one of the biggest was putting Knothole underground in the
beginning, whereas the TV show never had Knothole anywhere but out in
the open.

Uncle Chuck: the comics made him out to be a general tinkerer/chili dog
vendor, while "Blast to the Past" held that he was working for the
government when roboticized.  The circumstances of his mind being
restored also differ -- compare Sonic #30 with the "Sonic Conversion"
episode.

Bunnie's origins: open because the TV series never got around to
offering an explanation, though the story "Rabbit Deployment" (Sonic #3)
was followed by Teitelbaum.  Major difference: Blast to the Past
established Bunnie as a childhood friend of Sally and Sonic, whereas
there was no hint of that in Sonic #3.

Tails: we may be on the verge of an answer to the question of how Tails
got two tails: in "de-Tails" (the letters column in Tails #1), a
question about Tails' parents is answered by saying that it will
eventually be answered in an issue of Sonic.  So a Tails origin story,
if not a Tails reunion with his parent(s) story, may be in the works.
Knowing what happened to the script of "Growing Pains", though, I don't
hope for the best.

I am currently in the process of plotting out a story which involves the
homeworld of the Antisonic.  In order to get some background details
(before I start making them up ;-) ), I need to see a copy of "The Good,
The Bad, and the Hedgehog" from Sonic #11.  Since #11 is not available
as a back issue, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to photocopy
the story and mail it to me.  Black/white is OK, since I really need the
story more than the colors.  Will reimburse.  Let me know if you're
willing and I'll supply my snail mail address.

    Now, your flagship titles (The riverdale saga (: ) are always being
re-run in those Archie Digests.  You know, the one's that are small and
have some 120-150 pages of stuff?  Well, as you know, a lot of us Sonic
fans cannot get the early issues, or some of the odder ones.
    How about releasing a Sonic Digest or two?  Enable us to get these
early stories in a single, affordable book.  Yeah, they're gonna be real
small pix, but at least we can have them.
    Think about it, won't you?

My guess is that Archie has changed a few things in order to be creative
vs simply copying what happened on the TV show.

To add to the discrepancy... one of those 'novelettes' had Uncle Chuck 
deroboticized and staying with the freedom fighters right away.

The first novelette also called Sally a chipmunk and Rotor a sea lion.
It was probably written before they got any 'official word' though.

Tails Miniseries #2

I got the 2nd installment of the Tails mini-series recently.
It looks like they managed to tie up a few loose ends here 
from other storylines.  Crockbot is pretty cool but overall
I like the Sally miniseries better so far. 

I remember an old Marvel comic series where every once in a while
they'd add a whole mess of new characters and never really do 
anything with them except show off their powers once or twice.
I'm reminded of that in the Tails mini-series.

One thing I noticed here vs. the Sally mini-series is that the 
new characters have about the same level of abstraction as the 
original cast (I mentioned that before when commenting on the 
Sally mini-series...  all the new characters there, although 
drawn well, didn't seem to 'mesh with the style' of the old 
characters.. as if they came from a different comic book)

Dear Robert:

A Sonic digest or trade paperback collection is an idea that we have kicked
around several times here at Archie.  We are still thinking about it.  Until
we make an annoucement otherwise, however, there are no actual plans to print
such projects.  Your suggestion, however, has been duly noted and will be
passed along to the powers-that-be.  Thanks for being a fan!

Best regards,
Paul Castiglia

--=====================_815828489==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Since we've been talking about copyright issues and such I'm sending this
article I came across recently. According to the place I got it from its a
story out of the Hollywood Reporter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--=====================_815828489==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Even Genie never imagined Aladdin exploring "A Whole New World" from his
knees on a magic carpet behind a naked Jasmine.
Nor did Steven Spielberg envision one of his furry femal Tiny Toons
characters attracting a mate from out of her species.
But those and dozens of other highly professional-looking pornographic
variations of popular animated characters from Disney, Warner Bros, and
Paramount movies, NBC, Fox and Hanna Barbera TV shows, video games and
comic books are posted on a World Wide Web site on the Internet.
While some of the drawings simply feature characters such as Ariel of "The
Little Mermaid," Marge Simpson, Josie and the Pussycats and Babs Bunny in
the nude or Als and Scooby Doo getting excited by naked women, others are
more explicit. For instance, Babs is featured in various drawings
masturbating while reading a copy of "Huge Dudes" magazine and engaging in
sex with Buster Bunny and other characters.
In fact, Warner Bros. "Tiny Toons," created by Spielberg, is the subject of
many of the drawings, one of which features new lyrics to the show's theme
song under the new title "Teeny Toon": "We're hot and we're horny, we're
showing kniderporny..."
Studio officials at Disney, Warner, and Paramount were all unfamiliar with
the site when contacted on Tuesday, but all said that copyright issues are
routinely turned over to the legal department. None would comment on the
possible illegality of the drawings.
A source at Warners said the company has been notified of similar
situations on the Internet over the past year or two.
Owen Sloane, who specializes in entertainment law for Berger Kahn of Marina
del Rey, said that there is a certain amount of lee way regarding the use
of copy righted characters when lused for satire.
But there are limitations relative to interfering with the valule of the
character, he said.
Although he did not see the drawings, after listening to a descripiton from
a reporter he said as the images could have a damaging effect on the
characters themselves, "There are probably copyright problems here."
However, he said that so far companies have not been aggressive about
policing the Internet. "Most of the time Internet issues are not worth
pursuing because the distribution is small and it has little impact."
Mark Hilts, vp of Servic Tech, a Rochester, NY based Internet service
provider for the site said he was unaware of the nature of the content on
the site. He said he would check with lawyers right away and if it was
clearly illegal or porographic the site owuld b terminated. "If it's
clearly illegal or porno graphic in any way, it will be terminated," Hilts
said.
However, he added, "Everyone's idea of pornography is different."
Hilts would not divulge the name of the ownere of the site. E-mail to the
site went unanswered Tuesday.
Although the familliar charcters are featured in soft-core and hard-core
porno9graphic postions and settins, most of the drawings are signed, such
as one in which a Tiny Toons character is depicted performing felation on a
horse.
Directory pages that categorize the drawings by studio indecate that
although the drawings are based on copyrighted characters, the modifeid
pictures are "fan art" and may be distributed freely.
The site also warns users that the pictures are of an adult nature and "not
a place to shop around for the kiddies."

Just got Tails #2 this week.  I won't give you a spoiler :-)

One question, tho'.  Is it me, or does 'The Crater' look like The
Floating Island (Sonic 3, both parts) was ripped off from it?

That explains the enchida at the end......oops!

I sent in my order in mid-September, and I have yet to see the Tails 
mini-series either in the mail or locally.  I have received everything 
I've ordered in that order and the following one except for Tails (all), 
Chaotix, and the Knuckles special I ordred for Alejandra.

Dear friends

     Thanks for writing up that article, Michael.  And now I've heard from 
Dennis Falk that Warner's legal department is ordering the owner of that 
site to get rid of all Warner porn immediately.
     I feel awful about the loss of the perv section, too.  Maybe someone can
re-establish the perv section as an ftp site, who's address is disclosed only
on an individual basis to make it as clandestine as possible.
     
     See ya around.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

Another possible reason for making the perv section a little more 
secretive is, what exactly will keep little kids (12 and under) from 
downloading that stuff. Putting the perv section on an FTP site is a good 
idea because you can sorta screen those people who request it (ie. making 
sure there are not too young, or Sega looking for someone else to bust).

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest@lists.mv.net)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  You may change your subscription
status from "live" to digest or from digest to "live" at any time.
If you decide to change your subscription status, be sure that you
unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore, or you will
be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages twice.
See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net.
This address applies to both versions of the list.  If you feel
you must flame someone (other than Robotnik (g) ), please do so
in mail directly to that person.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters
and stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  You may post messages on the Sonic games to
the extent that the focus is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or
characters, and not on the games themselves.  Asking why Knuckles
rarely appears in the comics is on-topic, but asking how to become
"Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.  If you are interested in the
Sonic games too (or instead), please see "Other Internet Resources"
below.

Please do not post any of the following types of material:  binary
files, commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.
If you do, you are subject to immediate removal from the list and
suspension or termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt,
please contact the list manager before posting.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read
them before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from
the ftp site in /pub/sonic/text.  The Sonic Merchandise List can
be found in the same directory.  See "FTP Site" below for more
information.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
messages, send the command "get sonic mail.txt" (but without the
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo@lists.mv.net.

How To Change Your Status
=========================
To change from "live" to digest, send this text to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:

    unsubscribe sonic
    end

To change from digest to "live", send this text to

    subscribe sonic
    unsubscribe sonic-digest
    end


FTP SITE
========
There is a companion anonymous ftp site for this list.  Just ftp to
rat.org and go to /pub/sonic.  Upload files to /incoming; all uploads
are subject to approval.  You will find sounds, images, list archives
and a variety of information.  Users without regular ftp access may
may use ftpmail.  Please contact the list manager if you need help
locating a ftpmail server.

Other Internet Resources
========================
rec.games.video.sega / alt.sega.genesis
    Two Usenet groups for discussion of Sonic the Hedgehog and other
    games from SEGA.  Use these groups instead of this mailing list
    if you want to discuss the Sonic games, get codes/cheats, etc.
rec.arts.animation
    A Usenet group for discussion of animated cartoons.  Please
    read that group's FAQ before posting there.
alt.binaries.pictures.cartoons / alt.toon-pics
    Two Usenet groups for posting image files related to cartoons.
    The a.b.p.c group was intended to replace the a.t-p group.
    Some sites will carry one of them, some will carry both of
    them, and many sites don't carry either of them.
alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting digitized sound files related to
    cartoons.  This group is not widely propogated.
WWW
    The mailing list has a companion Web site with information,
    images, and links to Sonic-related newsgroups and other Web
    sites.  You'll find it at http://rat.org/sonic/ .

Many thanks to Ratman (Paul Hurley) for giving us a virtual Knothole.
The list manager is Erich Schulman who can be reached by e-mail at
sonic@rat.org.

Well, i have an IBM Thinkpad with the video capturing equipment on it. I
have captured a few shots form the sonic show. What do you need exactly,
and which episode? I guess e-mail me the details, and i'll see what I can
do....

First off, I'd like to welcome you aboard (it seems like most of the new

to what you said, I'm pretty sure it said in the letter something about "we

or some crap like that, unless my imagination's been going to that astral

I know I've already mentioned my story, The Hunt Begins, several times, but
I want to mention it now for the newbies and also to change the subject to
something pleasant.

Anyhoo, it involves the retelling of the sacking of Bluebrook, but this
time with flame-throwers and a new villain named Crotswurth.  It also
solves some mysteries Jaded Views hinted at, such as all the gory details
of Packbell's creation and how Maxl/Jade/Tracker came to be.  But it's just
the beginning.  It's also an allusion to two upcoming storylines (each by
one of the authors of Jaded Views): The 72 Hour Series, by Steven Tramer,
in which Maxl goes on a mad dash through a whole bunch of different
probabilities to stop a whole bunch of different -- but all equally evil --
Crotswurths from destroying and/or (the or being MUCH more likely 8D)
taking over each one; and Ignition Factor, by yours truly, a story about
how the young and apparently defective Hedgehog Xavier Chaos goes on a
series of adventures to prove his worth to the Powers that Be...but, more
importantly, to himself.

Speaking for Dan Drazen...heck, speaking AS Dan Drazen...I have to
declare a 

SPOILER ALERT!

[deleted by RDB - everybody's seen it by now :^)]

News flash: it's been Version 2.0 this whole season.  Last season the
shows were few, repeated *ad nauseum* and a little inconsistent IMHO.
This season's writing has been more on track; threads that were started
actually managed to come together as the season went on.  Don't know if
Hurst was a writer for the first season, but his style seems to be
coming through.  I could never have predicted (after his one-shot
appearance last season) that Uncle Chuck would become a major player,
though there have been some weak spots: Rosie was "introduced" in the
last scene of "Blast to the Past, part 2" but has not been seen since.
Too bad; she would make a good *eminence grise* for the kids in
Knothole, and take some of the burden of supporting female character off
Bunnie's shoulders.  She represents a wasted opportunity.  Dulcy made me
cringe when she was introduced but she's grown (slightly) into the role.
And aside from one burst of intelligent behavior in "Spyhog" [saving
Sally by grabbing her belt], Antoine continues to be stuck in the
buffoon role.

The television business being what it is, it appears that StH's option
for next season hadn't been picked up when the final ep for THIS season
was in production.  So there had to be a "resolution" but one that could
be undone should the show get another thumbs-up from ABC.  Thus, as near
as I can tell, the ambiguous demise of both the Doomsday project [don't
ask me *how* it was accomplished exactly] and Robotnik, who could always
come back next season if Snively doesn't work out as a villain.

Which brings me to characterizations.  Though fairly well-defined during
the first season, they're becoming more fully established this time
around.  That's always a help from a writer's standpoint.  Robotnik in
particular has been evil in a way that makes Naugus [the wizard trapped
in the Void] seem merely spiteful.  Snively couldn't hope to be that
kind of villain; based on his lines at the end of the "Doomsday" ep, all
I can count on from the little twerp is megalomania and overacting.

But even assuming Robotnik's "demise" there's enough to do with the
show's basic premise:

*  Snively could carry on Robotnik's vendetta against the "rodent."

*  Bunnie and Uncle Chuck still have to be deroboticized.

*  Sally has to be reunited with her father, stuck in the Void with
   Naugus.

*  Mobius has to be cleansed of Robotnik's influence.

These are the major plot points; the identity of Snively's "companion"
is the cliffhanger tease to close this season, if indeed that was the
last ep of the current season.  Other unanswered questions:

* What effect(s) of Sally's exposure to the Deep Power Stones will
remain?  I found myself wondering: "I wonder if she's going to spin off
into her own video game now?"  Will the power rings have the same effect
on her as they do on Sonic?

* Speaking of whom, what will happen to their relationship?  Especially
in light of their spit-swappage at the end of the ep.  We're not just
talking cameraderia here!

In short (which admittedly this post hasn't been), there's work enough
for the writers should the series be picked up for another season.
Every fan probably has their own wish list for the series, so here's
mine:

1. BRING BACK ROBOTNIK
No other villain could reach his level of credible evil.  Snively was
born to play second fiddle, and Naugus wasn't that well-developed as a
villain when he had his shot.

2. STRAIGHTEN OUT ANTOINE OR LOSE HIM
I've said it before and I'll say it again: it isn't "character
development" when an already-annoying character becomes REALLY annoying!
He's capable of some intelligent behavior, and the cheap laughs he's
getting from his role don't make it.

3. DO SOMETHING WITH ROSIE
Lots of potential here...I mean, even the comic writers recognize a
workable character when they see one (cf. "Sally's Crusade").  Having
her as a mother-figure in Knothole wouldn't be such a bad thing, and
it's possible that she and Uncle Chuck could strike up a relationship of
some sort.

4. FILL IN THE BLANKS
There are still a lot of unanswered questions about some of the
characters' backgrounds, any one of which would make a decent premise for
an ep or two:

> Was Sonic an orphan when Robotnik took over, being raised by Uncle
  Chuck, or were his parents roboticized?

> What happened to Sally's mother, the Queen?  Is there an unknown
  sibling who might oppose her as would-be leader of the Freedom
  Fighters coalition? [The advantage here is a conflict point quite
  apart from an alliance with Robotnik].

> Will it ever be established exactly how Bunnie got partially
  roboticized?  There seems to be a difference of opinion between Sonic
  #3 (I believe) and Mark Teitelbaum's "Robotnik's Revenge" book, and
  "Blast to the Past" almost answered that question.

That's enough for now, I think.

Not bad except for those 3 "horns" sticking out of his head (I prefer a 
plain old tuft like the other plushie has).

Hi to all the Sonic fans..
Just thought I'd drop a little note to say my name is Symon,
I realy like the Sonic cartoon, the one with Robotropolis and 
Knotehole...(WAY past Cool).

I'm looking for any sites on WWW where I can get Fan Fiction, and similar 
stuff....I've read Blood and Metal and was HOOKED.

Oh Yeah, has any one got some Cool ascii art of Sonic and the team, could 
you send it to me...address is below.

Till Robotnic wears a Tutu, and Snively tells him to shut up
Later

If you could send me maybe 30 megs (zipped) worth of the best ones, I'll 
put them on rat.org. Of course remember, Sega's watching... 

I'm sending this to the list to say "I'll carry some of the AVI files". I
can't carry all of them because I don't have the space. I only got 50MB left
total.

Tails Miniseries#1 [Dec 1995]
"Southern Crossover" -- Part 1
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     Who's that amusing himself with preadolescent delusions of
grandeur?  It's Tails, depicting himself as a comic book hero
[artwork by Gallagher] while continuing to nurse a grudge against
the older freedom fighters, and coming off more and more like an
obnoxious little ingrate (sorry, but his character's getting
REALLY disagreeable here!).  After some exposition for anyone who
missed "Growing Pains" Sally shows up; Tails hides his comic art
as well as the documentation that was the set-up for this
miniseries.  Sally tries to make Tails understand why the Sea Fox
wasn't filled with oil; Tails, still resentful, casts off at the
first opportunity.
     Meanwhile, Robotnik prepares his blimp to head for Southern
Mobius to supply his robo-underboss, Crocbot (I think Sonic would
appreciate the use of the word "blimp" in the same sentence as
"Robotnik" but anyway....).  We're made aware that Crocbot has
every intention of eventually overthrowing Robotnik and taking
over the whole shooting match himself, with the aid of his Wing
Dingoes (impressive bots, stupid name!).
     Tails, while out on the open sea, notices a shadow being
cast on the water by nothing -- it's the blimp, which has been
cloaked except for the underside; since the course of the blimp
would have taken it over the open seas, who knew?  Tails flies in
for a closer look but is zapped by two SWATbots.  He comes to
before hitting the water and created two water spouts to sink the
SWATbots.  When he tries to reboard the Sea Fox, who should be
waiting for him but the octobot from "Submersible Rehearsal"
[Triple Trouble special].  It trashes the Sea Fox and pulls Tails
underwater.
     Tails comes to and discovers that though he was on the verge
of drowning he was rescued by several underwater freedom
fighters: Bottlenose, a dolphin; Ray, a manta; P.B., a jellyfish
X-P; an unnamed giant clam; and Fluke, a blue whale.  With the
Sea Fox totalled, Fluke gives Tails a ride to Doununda.  To be
continued.
De-Tails (letters): Most noteworthy item was a response to a
question about Tails' parents: "You'll eventually find...out
[about Tails' parents] in Sonic's comic book."  It appears that a
Tails origin and/or reunion story is in the works.

#30 [Jan 1996]
"The Return of Uncle Chuck"
Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Art Mawhinney
     After two pages of Sonic's reminiscing about Uncle Chuck, we
dive into the plot.  Robotnik and Snively are preparing to test a
"transdimensional transporter" [hereinafter "T2"], and are about to
use Uncle Chuck as a test subject.  Something goes wrong (though
John Johnston suggests in his review that Snively had this planned
all along) and Robotnik ends up trapped in the Void.  While Snively
goes off to show Robotnik how to properly crush a rebellion, there
is an unforseen consequence of the accident: Uncle Chuck regains
his consciousness and will.
     Quick cut to Uncle Chuck's deserted chili dog stand where
Sonic just happens to be mooning about Uncle Chuck, and where Uncle
Chuck just happens to pop up.  Before there can be a tearful
reunion, quick cut to Knothole some time later where Uncle Chuck
could apparently think of nothing better to do than whomp up a
batch of chili dogs for the gang before warning them about Snively. 
Uncle Chuck returns to Robotropolis, where he steals plans Snively
has drawn up to mount a T2 on the nose of an aircraft.  Sonic and
Uncle Chuck go after the plane, but Sonic is (for lack of a better
word) voided.  Snively, with Sonic held as a captive audience, then
wastes a sizable chunk of the Great Forest before he's shot at from
another aircraft, this one piloted by Uncle Chuck.  Snively is all
set to destroy the entire planet out of either spite or bad writing
when Robotnik drops in on him...literally.  Seems Uncle Chuck got
him out of the Void in some unspecified way [Can you say "Deus ex
machina?" I knew you could], and returned him to Mobius on
condition that Robotnik not harm the freedom fighters.  The cookout
resumes.
     This little story has some BIG problems, especially when
compared with the "Sonic Conversion" episode.  In the latter, Uncle
Chuck's "restoration" is not just an accident or the byproduct of
an accident.  His building of the holographic diarama of Mobius
helped establish his scientific credentials; in this story (as well
as the comics in general) he almost comes off as a glorified short-
order cook.  Worst of all, there is NO SPACE AT ALL devoted to
Sonic and Uncle Chuck's reunion despite so much set-up.  Any
emotional impact has been totally sacrificed.  IMHO, a comic
adaptation of "Sonic Conversion" would have been preferable; it
would have also given Mawhinney a chance to draw "the Bunnie bod"
in its entirety, though showing Bunnie in profile at the top of
page 8 is less than flattering.
     "Who Keeps Stealing My Chaos Emeralds?"
     Story: Paul Castiglia; Art: Pat Spaziante
     In order to further safeguard some Chaos Emeralds from a
thieving "anteater", Robotnik sends Coconuts to set some traps on
an island base.  The traps are pure Chuck Jones-Roadrunner stuff
(and Castiglia does nothing to hide the allusion) and Coconuts
comes off worse than the shadowy biped "anteater" who (it is
revealed in the last panel) is Bunnie, making her first appearance
as a Spaziante subject.  Except for some severe foreshortening of
her left arm, her depiction should please her fanboys; as for
keeping her "on model" [see discussion of #29], Spaziante literally
skirts the issue.
     Sonic Art
     Knuckles' Chaotix Sneak Peek: 2-page splash/tease.  Haven't
played the game, but I seriously question the existence of Renfield
the Rodent (who looks too much like a Chicago alderman to suit me).
     Sonic Grams: Different artist [Freddy Mendez], same lame
office humor.  One page of plugs, which includes the information
that Geoffrey St. John will resurface in Sonic #31, and the return
of Mecha Sonic as part of the Chaotix special issue.  Also, in
answer to several questions in a letter, the news that Amy Rose
will be reappearing at some point.

Subject: Sonic's Parents

Hi.  It seems this list has been pretty much dead for awhile now, so I 
thought I'd try to drum up a discussion.  I've often wondered, has 
anything (cannon or otherwise) ever been established about Sonic's 
parents and why he was raised by his Uncle Chuck?  Does anyone have their 
own pet theory on this very important issue?

Boy, do I need a Sonic fix right about now.  I think I'll go to 
Blockbuster tomorrow and rent some of the eps on tape.  (I don't have 
cable, and even if I did, my local cable company doesn't carry the USA 
network. :(   )

DTA..

Okay, here is the AVI list, feel free to request any of the files from me..=
=20
hopefully they will be up on the Ratmans site soon.. Hmm.. must post him a
disk, Oh ya.. my apologies, most of the clips are from the crappy syndicated
series, and as the SABC transmitted them in ZULU, they don't have sound..=
 GEESH!

But I use them to make my own video.. I got a really cool one of me kicking
Tails into a tree.. Hey, Linds that should be to your taste!

Ohya, they are Indeo 3.2 Files, and naturally won't play if you don't have
the Indeo driver. So if they bugger up on my machine, drop me a message..
according to this disk I have.. it says I may freely distribute the driver
files :)

Teitelbaum (who relies on the original comics miniseries) simply calls
Sonic an "orphan."  Have yet to hear any circumstances as to how it
happened, though.  With the news that a story about Tails' parents is in
the works (de-Tails #1), that could afford a clue or two.  Of course,
the comics (at least the ones specifically aimed for a target audience
of rugrats) are hesitant about using the D-word -- it never even came up
in "Sally's Crusade: In The Still Of The Night" [Sonic #18] when it was
clear that Julayla was on her deathbed and had in fact, by the end of
the story, joined the choir.  So it'll have to be left to fanfic
practitioners  to fill in that particular gap.

DTA!

Okay, well enjoy, here it is my RL10 Story, 129K.. which means that you
should grab your coffie.. cancel your date with Vixen Vulpy, forget about
studying for important exams, and just generally read the story.

P.S. I began writing this story before I had Internet Access, so if any points
coincide with other stories, which they seem to in some odd ways, don't sue me
for it.. anyways.. I'm also real sorry that Jonathan and Mark are hogging the 
chars all the time.. I Know "It is the STH conference, Simon.."

Also, by now you will have heard the "he came from earth" storyline, I seem to
have seen a lot of them.. Well.. this is also one, but they don't simply
come from earth.. believe me.. the universe is not that simple.. also, this
is part
one of a trilogy, though this story is very complete, and won't leave you 
hanging. It has a sad part or two, but humour and satire definately have a
good deal of occurence in the story.. So save your tissues for episode
three, I'm telling you.. "It's just beautifull.. and so sad"  
[Try putting a softish female voice on for that last line]

Okay, well, anyone want to tell me what I did that is wrong for the story?


Cheers
Ablater

Hello everyone, well here it is my Sonic story. Though I would like
to tell you before you read it that there are a few things I didn't like,
for one Sonic didn't speak enough, and the story couldn't be modified
to give him big scenes. :-(

But, the rest of the story is pretty good, so READ on.
******************************************************************************
Bugs: What the hell do you mean bugs, this is a text file, you can't have
bugs in a text file! ;-)
1) Will not display if motherboard is immersed in 1 or more litres of water.
2) Still has some linedefs that cause the HOM effect. (Bugfix soon!)
3) Won't be able to get the STH, TTF or STS if playing on Deathmatress. :(
4) Altogether won't run on a 286 when Windoze in in enhanced mode. :(((
5) Will not work if less than 16Kb of memory is installed on your system.
6) Will not work without controller card or graphics card.
7) Is not compatible with 40X25 Mode. (V1.12! coming soon!)
8) Will not run under Windoze when in an OaSis/2 session.
9) Requires you have a keyboard installed.
10) No support for sPAS-16+ yet, (Does anybody actually support it?)
******************************************************************************
Sonic the Hedgehog and other associated characters are based on
the creations of Service and Games (Sega), Archie Comic
Publications, and the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons (Saturday

characters that appear are the original creations of their
respective authors (characters indexed by author):
David Pistone:  Packbell

******************************************************************************
All the copyright text, "Sonic .. and other.. bla bla bla" was ripped from
Sean Wolski's "Evolution of a Predator", you should read his 
"Temporal Syndrome" I think it is brilliant! P.S. I'm lame for ripping 
copyright text.. ;-)

Shawn did you get the E-mail I sent you, or does my Email all really
vanish into the NO CARRIER void? The answer there is obvious -- it does!
Just a thought, if you're not getting it, and I'm not getting it back, who's
getting it--King Acorn? [HIYA ACO!]

If you feel so emotionally controlled by this story, or are unable to think

Other junk..

The GR, CALA, GMM, Jonathan Righter, Marken Psantis, the Cinz
race, Kate, Craig, GRB-I, and GRB-II are all copyrighted by me..
Please don't write any further stories about them, as this will most
probably be their last occurence in this storyline. (That's why 
Jonathan gets killed. Killed you ask? Well, read on and find out!)

******************************************************************************
                     RL10- Tortured Freedom by Simon Howes
******************************************************************************

"The universe is so dark and evil" Jonathan Righter thought to himself
that night as he stood in the communications room, staring out at the stars.
"And" he added, "..so unpredictable.."

It was the Earth year 1997, though he was standing amass technology so 
advanced that it would take his homeworld some one and a half thousand years
to achieve it. He smirked as a ship raced by in the void outside the huge 
three meter perspex window of the base he was on. 

This was GRB-II, "Guardians of the Reality, base two.."  Though it was based
on GRB-I it had a few major revisions. For instance this was a starbase, 
while the original was a planetary base, this base was outfitted with shields,
had fifty-eight fighter ships, two-hundred and ninety six weapons turrets,
four thousand seven hundred and fifty three warheads onboard, was outfitted
with a main weapon capable of tearing a small moon in half, and could
detect a ship all the way across the galaxy.

Yep, the GR didn't want a repeat of GRB-I to occur, he dropped his eyes. 
That evening four years ago was still locked in his brain, and haunted 
his dreams. 

Back then he was still a rooky, flying small missions to all parts of the
universe. Nothing really big or exciting ever really happened, until
on one return flight he came back to the smoldering remains of
what the Cinz had left of his base. There were few survivors, from a group
of six-hundred only a dozen remained. 

He'd sworn revenge, heading back to a bar in RL8, finally the truth dawned
on him. The Cinz yolk now ruled the universe, and those who supported the
GR were rebels.

"So be it", he said, joining up with others sharing his view, they made a
suicidal attack run on the Epsilon Mysadness system. An attack that went 
down in history as the day the rebels became the law. 

Not long after that , he came into a confrontation with the Cinz emperor, 
Mmmammaris. 
And in a cold battle of bitter revenge he drove a shard of crystal through
it's heart. Before the last drop of blood had fallen, the dying emperor had
a chance to hurt once more. "By CALA, we will be victorious!"
And with that he died, striking a blow to the human's heart that could never
be healed.

A blow that drove him on further, made him cold, even at times as evil as the
Cinz in the quest for revenge. Once he had found a Cinz nursery, and 
destroyed it--with little regard for emotion and in an atire that would make 
Mmmammaris himself shirk. He coldly destroyed Cinz ships feeling no pain,
nor gaining no pleasure from it. He ravaged Cinz planets, throwing every
weapon at his power down on them below, coldly killing the empire.
His weapon accuracy was so high from the killing of the 116 he personally
had overseen, that he could take a leaf out at a range of three hundred 
meters with his pistol, and there was more.. he seeked them out wherever
they hid, no matter who they were, peacefull or hostile. To him, if they
were Cinz.. they were his responsibilty. At times they even begged for mercy,
mercy that he delivered quickly, coldly and effectively--with super-ionized 
gas.

Yet, this was not him, his friends always knew his as a caring, soft,
honourable person. The same person who had titled the RL god "Cala" 
seven years ago. "Computerised Advanced Linear Accelarator", extremely
crude and very far off, and he was the only one who knew that, everyone
else used the name without ever knowing what it meant.

But he knew CALA was a computer, it's logics unknown, and it's boards
forever hidden. It was a moderator, it chopped and spliced situations
with it's particle tools. It could make madmen out of hydrogen and flesh 
out of dust. In it's own way.. it was a god.

And like a god, it had it's own stars, it's own worlds and realities--this
very area of space he was now in was dubbed RL8. Which stood for "reality-
level eight"  A place of high technology that even when removed from 
'Cala-space' would remain functioning. 

The other realities all had their own odd attributes, depending on the
involvement "Cala" had in them, the lower the reality level. In reality
level one, you might find yourself stretching lakes around, like in some
mad cartoon, while in Rl9, life was very much 'Real.'

RL10, was called the untouched reality, this included Earth, and all areas
of space Cala didn't control. Whether Cala left them, or couldn't control
them it would never be known. 

He glared out into the void, one of those stars out there somewhere was Sol,
his home system. It's exact spacial co-ordinates he would never know, after
all he travelled to and from Earth via a gateway.. or the science-fiction
classic a port'al.

He turned his head to get more of a view, so many stars, but out of all of
RL10, he knew of only one race.. the humans.. Whatever or whoever had built
the moderator would never be known to him, "besides" he though, there were
more important things to do--like cleaning the galaxy.

******************************************************************************
                           Time : 10:30 AM on GR base 2
******************************************************************************
"Damn", he shouted out, "damnit all to hell", where have those suckering low
swine run to this time, Jonathan slammed the one metre radar screen as if 
though it would reveal where the Cinz ship had so suddenly disappeared to.

Marken, his partner and friend, also from RL10, who had joined him in the 
service of protecting the realities after he had proven their existence to 
him in late 1990, was unable to think of anything to calm his friend down
with. This case was indeed very rare, and the concept of a ship just 
vanishing of a sub-space radar was indeed odd.. in fact, it was almost 
impossible. 

Jon whirled around to face Craig, the super genius, almost super human, brain
of the GR. "Explanation.. if you please, has our antenna dropped off" He found
himself wondering about peering outside to see if it really had, though, they
would have been informed by the computer had that really happened. 

Craig gave a blank stare for a moment, his mind racing through all the 
possibilities, but carefully selecting the most likely. He was from RL9, a 
place of human dominance and incredible technology, also, amazingly a place
that including RL8 was scientifically compatible with RL10, meaning anything
built there could be ported to RL10, and used without the need for CALA to
emulate it. Whereas a RL3 flying machine would probably explode before you
could throttle it enough for takeoff.

Finally, he stopped, nodded his head attracting Jonathan's attention, 
collected his thoughts for a moment then began. "The most likely possibility
is that their ship headed out of CALA's range, or as such into RL10 space."
Then he walked over to the monitor and began explaining, " after all, they
were at the furthest in the sector I have ever known a ship to be in, and
as you already established to us three years ago, CALA throws ships at the
border of CALA RL's at lease fifteen light years away. If you think
about it, it's a kind of protection system really isn't it?" He glanced
back up at the two partners, "I'll bet, that if anything came too close to 
the borders from outside, CALA would toss them just past the border at the
other side, making our place in space eternally hidden."

Jonathan looked blankly up at him, stunned, he could see it now, Earth, his
homeworld shattered by Cinz ships, houses burning, the smell of human flesh
only too common.. "Earth, they may find Earth, we have to stop them!"

Craig reasuringly looked back up at him, trying his best to comfort him,
"Jon your universe is many times larger than ours, with so many combinations
of possibilities that the chances of them ever finding your homeworld would
so minimal that.."

But Jonathan was already running, with Marken tagging behind him, he squeezed
out as he dashed.. "Now or ever, my first loyalty is always to my reality!"

Fifteen minutes later, their ship was spewing it's fiery plasma out as it
blazed to it's jump position, then instantly, as the gravity fields, those 
from nearby stars, and those from his jump drive overlapped one another,
his ship was gone, slingshotted at a speed not capable of being measured, not
by light at least, into the great beyond of realspace.

******************************************************************************
                      Time : 19:00  on the Planet Mobius
******************************************************************************

Robotnik was annoyed again, and nothing he had access to could relieve it,
already he had beaten a few of his earlier model robots into scrap metal with
an iron bar.. However the only result of this was that he had damaged his
wrist and was in fact now even more irratated. To make matters worse he had
a cold, something that he had not thought he could get on this planet, 
apparently the Mobian virus had mutated to be compatible with one of the very
few of his species on the planet that it would effect - him. 

"Suck all the atmosphere away", he mumbled to himself, a plan which he wished
he had initially followed, it was too late now however, as his factories 
had need for that air. Had he only not been so arrogant to assume he could
have taken Mobius without any difficulties, he would be free of that 
blue pest now.

A sick though came to his mind, the hedgehog lying all bloated from the 
effects of the vacuum, an evil smile crossed his face. Even with all the
mechanics latched onto his body, he still retained his ability to
have dreams. 

The door behind him shooshed open, a metallic drone of a service 'bot, he 
had once designed, echoed out to him. "..Sir..is..there..anything..I..can..get 
..for..you.."  

He pushed the button on his chair and reeled round to face the bulk of junk, 
"actually there is something, I would like one hedgehog, on a plate."

The baffled droid responded, "I..am..very..sorry..sir..your..order..cannot..
be..completed..now..as..I..have..no..ingredients..of..type..hedgehog.."
He interrupted it, with a short question, "why not?"
 
The droid, reeled for a moment to adjust it's servos that were slipping under
it's own weight. "..sir..you..either..robotized..or..killed..all..hedgehogs..
we..have..ever..had....except..for..one..that.."
He didn't want to hear anymore about Sonic, "Destroy yourself" he dictated.

And the droid tore itself to pieces with it's own servos, but from it he
gained little pleasure, just the stopping of that terrible word that 
haunted his days and destroyed his factories by night.

******************************************************************************
        Time 19:30 Mobius Time, aboard the Cinz Ship "Eternal Victory"
******************************************************************************

Commander Myponda of the Cinz Ship "Eternal Victory", stood proudly
on the bridge, he talked over the plan again, it was good to hear success,
and even if they had to repeat it to him a hundred times, he would still never
get over that tingling feeling of a soon to come victory. After all he was 
a Cinz warrior, one of the Elite. Victory, success and chivalry 
reined in every particle of his blood.

Sub captain Myroda, spoke to him, like all honourable Cinz pilots, he had
changed his name to begin with an "M" when he had gained his high rank, "M"
a sign of incredible honour.. "Sir, those GR fools cannot stop us now, and.."
he tensed his mandible in a sign of pride, honour and success,
"I was right about sending that probe out nine months ago, for it has 
succesfully found life on a nice planet. Safe in truespace from those GR 
fools, we will be able to build up the ultimate armada there, then sweep back
and show them what real power entails. "

"Excellent, but one thing, what life is there on this planet?" 
Myroda laughed, "our scanners have shown only factories, run by machines, 
and maybe one or two humans, but, these factories are built to make droids!"

Myponda reeled his neck backwards and forwards , the custom way for a high 
ranking officer like himself to show his happiness.

But there was more, "also, sir, forest makes up twenty percent of the planets
land mass.. TWENTY PERCENT SIR!"  Myponda smiled," well, that will 
speed up the process of making it preferable to our needs." He stopped for
a moment, then dictated to Amaropolis, "Have the biological pods prepared
for launch, we'll have need for them after we purge the planet of the 
inferior life that inhabits it."

The Cinz could best be described as "Psycho Gardners", anybody who
knew a Cinz would tell you that they LOVED nature, after all, it was 
part of their honour. Unfortunatly, this honour also said something 
about the Cinz being the rulers of all creatures, sentient, non-sentient,
silicon and plant. So, while they would really fix up the eco-system of 
a planet they took, their was a slight problem for you if you were 
not a Cinz yourself. Though, the Cinz were not cruel, they would give you
two choices, instant painless death, or retro-engineering (A process in
which sentient beings were made non-sentient.) However the GR really
didn't like this at all, after all only 4% of their members were Cinz. 

They crew laughed as their ship neared a few hours at full speed to
what they believed would be their new home.

******************************************************************************
 23:00 Aboard GR Fighter of Jonathan Righter, GR Base 2 Time 
******************************************************************************

Marken and Jonathan sped through space at the fastest speed their
ship could effectively go, they had passed into RL10 just seconds ago, but
their speed still held solid.. "Made in 8" joked Marken as they passed through
into ten without tearing into pieces.. 

Marken targetted a ship some fourteen million blips away, then typing some 
jargon on the keyboard predicted it's destination.. A planet somewhere in 
a constellation they may have never seen, he fiddled a bit more, and a 
jerky wireframe image of a spherical planet came onscreen. Slowly data on it
began being calculated, spin time, 20-30 hours, atmosphere type, "life planet".

Jonathan rubbed the gun he carried on him, then whispered softly, "Earth, they
are going for Earth.. intolerable, for which they must be punished..."

******************************************************************************                              
                                 Time 20:30 Mobius
******************************************************************************

Tails was lying in bed looking up at the stars, Bookshire had told him that
every star, however small it was, probably had planets the size of Mobius
revolving around it. It was hard to consider this, they seemed so small, even
to him, so far, they would never be reachable. Then something caught his eye,
in a constellation he knew only too well by it's shape, there was a new star.

An odd star, not flickering like the others, but staying permanently bright,
it couldn't have been a sattelite, he had seen plenty of them, smoothly
moving across the sky, doing their evil jobs for Robotnik..

Perhaps it was a planet, but, it didn't really matter now, as he drifted off
to sleep, feeling secure with his friends. Unknown to him a ship of mass
destruction bore down on their little world.

Outside Sonic was chuckling to Sally about the new nets that they had 
installed.. he concluded finally as the laughter began dying down, "Yeah, it
sure was nice of old Robuttnik to lend us all those nets.."

Nets all across the forest had beed repositioned by Sonic, and when the 
droids went scouting in the morning to see what they had brought them, they
would be quite amazed.. with any luck Robotnik himself would step in one, 
that and the cold would put him on an all time low.

****************************************************************************** 
                 Time 8:30 Aboard Cinz Ship (Mobius Time)
******************************************************************************

They all looked down on the blue planet, Yes, this would be their new home, 
the gunners locked weapons on the factories, already fifteen sites had been
selected, upon firing, all artificial power sources on Mobius would be shut
down. One of sites included a pond, the commanders sneered, did the fools 
really think they could hide a power source like that.. in a pond, how 
ridiculous!

The ship locked it's weapons, dropped their shields, and began loading 
and arming thermonuclear torpedoes for launch.

******************************************************************************
                             Time 8:32 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
Tails had noticed that the star he had seen the night before was still there,
only bigger and brighter than before. Grabbing his binoculars he flew up into
a tall tree to get a better look. 

Was it a planet? The fox's mind boggled at the possibilities, then, all at 
once he realised, it was moving! 

Flying from tree to tree to get a better look at it, he gradually headed 
farther and farther away from the village. 

******************************************************************************
                             Time 8:50 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
Myponda looked over the controls, "Okay, open the hatches!"  An adlib voice
echoed. "OPEN!"  Then he smiled, "Check final launch statistics" 
"CHECK!"

He reeled back in morbid desire, "Fire!"

Suddenly there was almighty explosion, Myroda, Myponda, the crew and all  
fifteen armed thermonuclear torpedoes turned to vapour. They had paid the
price for being arrogant, in failing to raise shields or monitor their radars,
Jonathan and Marken had brought their small ship to bear on them, firing a 
single missile. 
Now, where the "Eternal Victory" had sat proudly just a few minutes ago, a 
rapidly expanding show of ionized gas entertained the dead. Jonathan's craft 
sped on rapidly through this gas, an unfortunate result of inertia. The shield
monitors jittered as the occasional piece of debris ablated against the blue
aura two meters away from the ship. 

A clanging resonated through the hull as a huge piece of inactive structure
puffed through the shield, impacted up against the main viewport and fore 
antenna. The perspex window cracked, hissing as the atmosphere tried to 
normalise. The debri, shuddered as it bounced up and went scraping back 
across the top of the hull, tearing cables, antenni and top mounted units of
all kinds into the eternal residence it was promised.
Systems aboard went haywire, the little fighter plummeted towards the
blue-green planet below. On contacting the atmosphere, the collision with
air particles and the fact that shields were inoperative (the generator 
floating around a few kilometers away), caused the GR ship to temporarily
become a ball of fire. In the heat, systems began to malfunction, the 
main plasma engine imploded, sending super ionized gas throughout the ship.

For a microsecond, as it streamed just over his body, the thought of eternal
danger raced in Jonathan, seconds later, there was no trace of him or his 
friend, save a burning comet falling to earth. 

An awestruck Tails watched the display, and excitedly flew towards 
where the ball of fire was heading.

******************************************************************************                             
                               Time 10:30 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
He had flown as fast as he possibly could to get to the crash site in time,
but, by the time it was actually in view, Tails saw it was crawling with 
droids. He abruptly stopped, sat on a branch in a tree and tried to work out
what they were doing.

Through the binoculars he could see them scavenging the mutilated flesh of
machinery that manifested as the engines just minutes before. Then, as one of
the 'bots removed a glowing orb from it, he leaned forwards to get a better
view.

All of a sudden, the new vectors acting on the branch he was on overcame the
weight threshhold, it snapped, and in an instant he was laying on the
floor. The fall had not in fact been fatal, his mass combined with the 
softness of the leaves below reduced most of the impact, leaving him only 
slightly stunned.
But the noise had been sufficient to arouse the droids attention, two of them
raced towards him, frantically he stood up, disoriently running for a 
clearing where he would be able to take off from, not more than meters away.
The droids servos thrashed behind him as their tracks cracked over leaves and
threw up dust. The clearing was less than two meters now, he began 
spinning his tails, and then suddenly there was an immense amount of upward
lift.

But, it was not his, his tails had not even began to produce enough lift to
get him airborne yet, and he was now hanging in one of the net's 
Sonic and he had moved around to play havoc with the droids.

******************************************************************************                             
                           Time 11:30 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
Jonathan stood stunned and shocked on a small hill amongst the grasslands,
alongside him Marken brushed his fingers through his hair, trying to keep 
his normal cool collected image. "Well, I guess 'auto teleport out' was made
in RL8 or we would be so wasted now, kinda like those toasties you make." 
He laughed, but his counterpart couldn't bring himself to share in the humour,
lost in shock and thought he stared off towards the blue horizon. This 
annoyed Marken, he didn't like people who kept to themselves. They 
reminded him too much of how he used to be, before he'd created his
new image. Now, everyone believed he was an open person, and in
a way, this is what he was. If anything bothered him, he would 
disguise it in a joke and post it.. Instant removal of problems.

Finally Jon' rotated his head, he slowly spoke, his voice trembling from the
shock he had had, "we should have died, it was only luck that saved us, do 
you realise that?" Pausing for a moment to allow his rhetorical question to  
detonate he continued "I only just had enough energy to teleport out, if we 
had been just a few hundred meters away..." his throat closed up, choked by
the harsh brutality of reality, he was unable even to make eye-contact, fearing
the pressure around his eyes would relieve itself. He was a man, he would
not expose himself as being like that.

Marken mused, "but, hey, we had a brill pilot.. we were never in danger, 
hey, he intended to do that!" His friend smiled at his joke, but the 
joke-maker himself did not. There had been plenty of times in his life
that he'd cheated death... The attack run on Barotis, if it hadn't been for
that silicon wonder planted in his head he would be just another gas
cloud so common to Cinz space. 

Ah, the "device" as they called it, a wonder of RL8's scientific community.
It basically was a body management system, but to any normal person,
you might as well call it magic, as the electronics inside it were so 
complex that Magic was close to what it was. It supplied a whole series
of features each one responding differently to what RL the user was in.

Yes, the device demonstrated once more their dependance on it, as far back
as he could remember ever since that device was implanted there had never 
been a day he hadn't used it. After all, that was impossible, since it 
dynamically overlayed text on his vision, displayed menus of options, played
back video clips, stored data errorlessly on his brain, and gave him  
abilities ranging from an external shield to a database on recipes. 

But all this didn't matter right now, his friend was far too shocked to do
much, so the first move would be his. Removing a radio from his belt he 
tried to call Paxis (their Earth connection), naturally, due to the fact 
this was not Earth (even though they assumed it was), there was no 
connection at all. He played around with it for a while, but in the end 
decided that it had to do with them being at such a remote location.
This didn't really worry him, encouragingly he spoke his thoughts out loud
in hope of inspiring his friend. "Well, this stupid hill-billy land doesn't 
seem to have any sattelites.. So, I guess we'd better just use a phone."

He obtained the desired effect, Jonathan looked up, then in a recharge of 
will he burst out, "yes, let's find and borrow some nice swedish
farmers phone." Marken looked at him funny, "Geesh, your geographies not
very good is it.. I'm telling you, this is Scotland, look at the hills.."
They chattered on about their ineffectiveness at being human as they 
passed by a rather furry tree and up into the forest.

A few seconds later the tree shook as princess Sally dropped out of it, 
she had been on lookout, when suddenly they had seemed to pop out of nowhere. 
Spies - Robotniks spies, for sure, she'd seen them transmitting information 
to him, pointing, planning, then heading off to scout out the forest.
As she ran towards the forest to warn her allies, she reminded herself to 
keep a better eye out in future..

******************************************************************************                              
                        Time 12:00 Robotropolis 
******************************************************************************
Robotnik's mood had taken a swing for the better, the blue hedgehog was not 
going to be meddling with his plans in future, not if he valued his little friends
life.
Tails hung in a cage suspended from the ceiling, occasionly making feeble 
threats about how Sonic would render bodily harm to him. But to Robotnik, 
there was no immediate danger, for the cage that he had crafted had a series 
of preserving features built in. For one, it was made out of solid titanium, 
no hedgehog would be cutting through it--ever . Secondly, there 
was no doors or locks, the only movable part in it was the base which snapped 
on to the bars, each one acting as a padlock. Finally, and this one he really 
liked, the only way it could be opened was by a code known only to him, 
any other numerical combination he had told Tails would cause a small nuclear 
device housed in the base to detonate. 

Though this wasn't the truth, he preferred not to have easily activated 
nuclear weapons in his near proximity, it served to further tighten the rope 
that he would strangle the blue blurr and his friends with. 
"Yes" he mumbled to himself, today was going to be a good day, he had 
configured a trap that there was no escape from, 
at least not any method concievable to him..

******************************************************************************                              
                         Time 12:30 Mobius Forest 
****************************************************************************** 
For an hour now they had been walking, the forest seemed to eternally drag on,
making their quest seem all that harder. Marken kept up his encouraging views
of life, making jokes about everything Jonathan could possibly say.  
Jonathan now had given in to the irratation, and simply took the bad 
jokes with the eternal journey. Every now and again though he would make a 
comment in vain attempt to make the babbling torture less by changing the 
subject.

"Mark, we must be miles away from any civilisation" he burst in a 
hyperbolic tone, "where on Earth are we, the Australian wastelands?" 
Like a automatic weapon his friend spat out long streams of fiery replies and 
bad jokes. "Come on, we must be near to something, have you seen any animals
around?" Jonathan hadn't thought about that, these woods were as deserted as
his cupboard on the day before payday, his mind wondered into long thought 
about the enviroment they were wasting so badly on his home planet. 

But his loss in thought was not tolerable to Marken, who's constant streams 
of text once again revived his mind from the pit of serenity. "Just follow 
the smell of pollution Jon. There's carbon monoxide not far off, trust me, my
senses are better than.. than .. than.. Well, whatever, but believe me, I 
notice everything, see everything, smell everything and sometimes I even.."

Almost as in response to his boasting, an unnoticed trap they had sprung now 
levitated them in a net about fifty centimeters above the ground. Marken 
quickly appended a line to his boasts. "See, told you I would find 
civilization!" Jonathan couldn't help laughing at the sheer will his buddy 
had. "Great Mark, now next time, let me do the navigation", he pointed to the
dirty chimneys spewing out smoke across the valley. 

Suddenly however their attention span was pricked by a group of creature not
very native to Earth, standing assertively around them. Jonathan for a moment 
was shocked, "Psantis, I thought we were in RL10?" A blank stare from his 
colleague showed that his thoughts were indeed not altogether unique. He 
looked at the "device's" overlay, as it confirmed they were in true space.
In awe he tried every test that his little onbrain computer had to offer, 
each time being slapped in the face by the same answer- RL 10..

Marken however had already began to initiate communications, whether it was 
RL10 or RL3, it was all reality to him. "Uh hi, I'm Marken Psantis from.."
His speech was cut short as one of the leaders of the biased crowd stepped  
forward and terminated it by begining his own. "Well looky what the hedgehog
dragged in, two of Robuttniks monkeys.." The crowd made happy laughs and 
sarcastic comments, all of which Marken didn't exactly catch. 
He didn't like this potentialy explosive situation, mistaken identity can
be humourous.. at times.. this was not one of them. And looking at those 
splines the blue hedgehog masqueraded one thought came to mind - impalation.
He tapped his shocked comrade on the arm, trying to suggest that he take over
but whether he was busy running diagnostics or just plain scared, he did 
nothing. 

Next, the net delivered them into the merciless hands of the crowd, and ropes
from all around bound the two next to one another. All the way round, right
down to their knees. Then, with a hasty push, the crown maneuvered them 
off towards the unknown. Jonathan, didn't like this situation at all, 
if they were in RL10, and this was Earth, some world-wide constitutions had
sure changed since he was last here. If this wasn't Earth, they were in more
trouble than he had ever imagined.. trapped without ships, lights years away
from ANYTHING.. anything but this. 

Something was hurting him as it rubbed up against his side, he strained under
the ropes to try and move it. Upon contacting it, he realised all at once 
what it was ... his pistol! Squeezing his hand to all flexible limits he
forced it onto the trigger. 

Then the party stopped, the blue hedgehog came forward and began speaking 
to them, whatever he said, neither of the GR men heard. Marken was trying to
get reasonable grasp on the situation to build up a rescuing speech. Jonathan
was trying to find the power/safety button on his pistol. 

Sonic looked at the pitifull servants of Robotniks, squirming, trying not to
look suspicious the blondehead was consumed in his attempt to escape. Sonic
walked over to him and jabbed him in the side, shocked, he looked at him.
His comrade started up, 
"Excuse me Mr Hedgeporcupinepersonniceguyswhostoonicetoconsiderimpalingme,
 but uum, what planet are we on.."
Sonic was baffled, why did they want to know something like that, he was
about to  answer when suddenly a high pitched tone rapidly increasing it's 
frequency emmanated from under the ropes. 

In a burst of light a loud explosion of gas answered the whining, the rope 
around Jonathan exploded. People screamed, diving behind trees to avoid 
crossing the path of that weapon.

As they did, fate revealed the grim testament of what plasma can do to flesh,
Jonathan's right leg was morbidly trimmed, the flesh on his thigh stripped
away. He screamed and realed back, gun harmlessly pointing towards the sky.

To Sonic that was the only opening he needed, thrusting forward he was 
suddenly suprised by the lack of traction. By the time he had realised that
Marken had plucked him up from the ground it was too late, something cold
wrapped around his neck - sending a chill down through his body. 
He desperately tried to struggle, his power being clipped by the 
luminous-pink restrainer collar. 

Marken quickly evaluated the situation, took the gun off his friend and held
it to his captives head. "Look, everyone.." his voice uncertain, "we don't
want any trouble, now.. we're just going to take a little walk off somewhere,
and if you are all good, we'll.. we'll just drop off your friend.. OK?" 
But there was no reponse, so he added his own, "Ok, Ok, so it's cool, we're
just going to drift back off down here. Ok? And.. nothing's going to happen
because we're all cool.. Right? Yeah.. Ok?" 

Jonathan gained support by leaning on his shoulder as they hopped off 
backwards into the trees. After a few meters they came to a path. Mark
dropped Sonic, slipping his hand round the collar, increasing the
power, slowly until his captive was too deep in sleep to cause further
complications.

                          Time 14:30 Mobius Forest 
****************************************************************************** 

Jonathan groaned, the leg was a goner, he layed down between the bushes  
looking at the cooked meat. If only the gun had been a few centimeters 
further away, the "device" could have raised shields, if only HE had used the 
gun when they were hanging in the net. But no matter how much he regretted 
the situation, it would have no effect on it. They were in a world where
humans were outlawed, a world from which there could be no possible escape.
Even now, "the device" was running down on energy, soon, as the energy 
orbs situated on the inner of spine discharged, his limited special abilities
would go with it. Starved of food and without allies they would die on this
planet, just like Craig had always said: "you will die in RL10."

Marken Psantis looked over his injured friend and partner, despite his 
advanced medical training, there was no way he could make flesh out of air,
morphing would help, had they sufficient energy to "fusion morph" where
nearby particles are converted into the required substance. But, they didn't,
then energy required to even fuse hydrogen together was so high that only
Cala alone could perform it. 

But, there were alternatives, "Jonathan, what if you transform into something
smaller?" A horrified stare replied, "in RL10, do you realise what that would
be like?" No, he had no idea.. so he let him continue. "While Cala simply 
lets us flash into another form, the RL8 morpher involves physical and 
emphasis on physical morphing... have you ever wondered what it feels like to
have your spine collapse?"

Mark, edged closer, "what other chances do we have", he pointed to the 
scorched leg, "anyhow, in a few days we won't get another chance.." Jonathan
shifted on the floor, letting out a softened cry of agony.. "Well, I guess",
 turning his head away his voice began to tremble, "we have to do what we
have to do.. right?" Mark continued hastily, "well, shall we do it then?" 
"No, we'll be vulnerable for hours, we take it in turns, if anything occurs,
we protect one another or lead off the enemy.. OK?" Psantis stalled for a
moment, "You go first.." pointing to his comrades leg.

A chill ran down his spine, there was no way out, he selected the morph 
command, put up two-orbs for use, leaving the last one, then, "the device"
gave him a list of rotating images, each one the creature he could try change 
into, he let "the device" select for him that which would be the most 
effective. The selected image flashed over his mind too quick for him to
register what had been chosen, and then , a little dialog came up.  

Calculating internal paths..

The percent done slowly increased, every percent freezing his heart more, he
stared at Mark. "Well, I guess this is it.. see you on the other side.."
thirty-two percent. Marken smiled at him, "good luck.." 
Fourty-eight percent, the andrenalin gland that was soon to be rocked pumped
out it's load under the "device's" orders..
Sixty-five percent, heart racing, Jonathan took a deep gulp.
One hundred percent...
For the few seconds the 'device' did it's last calculations, Jonathan gave a
grim smile. 

Then he rolled forward, mouth hanging open, drooling from it as a loud gut 
wrenching snapping from his spine resounded, he dropped face down, tears 
streaking from his eyes. His leg made a crackling sound, and with an abrupt
burst, blood flew up against the bushes as the bottom of the limb detatched
itself. Marken grasped his hand, holding it reassuringly while the crackling
noises of morphing bones like splintering wood continued. Standing on his 
knees, he tried the best he could to comfort his friend. 

Suddenly there was a shout from the distance, "There he is!" He rotated his
exposed head around to see it, they had found him, and they were coming his
way rapidly.. "Jonathan.."   The bloodied body replied, "Go.. leave me.. save
yourself.. "  Mark couldn't, gripping his hand, he pleaded, "Jonathan.." 
But Jonathan had been given the mercy of the gods and did not respond, he 
looked back, they were closer now, then, he felt some of the weight taken 
off his hand... Clutched in his hand was a broken off part of his comrade,
he knew what to do.

Tears of sheer determination raced down his heart as he charged toward the
oncoming. Several darts hit him, but his body kept on, his only goal to lead
them away. As the drug in the darts touched his heart, his body pathetically 
thudded to the ground, his only consolation the rescue of his friend.
For a moment he lay there, before darkness led him down a loomy passage.

Apart from the white overlay from the 'device' and the little energy-low icon,
the world was silent to Jonathan Righter. Lying on the floor, his eyes closed,
his new body's skin fizzed as it completed the last part of the morph. 
His perception was static and chaos, the neurons in his brain not fully 
rerouted by the 'device' yet.  He had come to the eye in the storm of chaos,
disoriently he stood up, muscles moving incorrectly in spasms. He opened his 
eyes, a luminous bright image came to them, in the far-off distance some 
figure moved. He had to get away from this spot, storing it's coordinates, he
stumbled forth, collapsing some meters away in a bush as the 'device' 
restarted it's configuring process.

****************************************************************************** 

"H.. h.. hh. he's awaking r..r..Robotni.. SIR!"
"I hope so Snively.. for your sake."

He opened his eyes, looking straight up at a metallic ceiling, around him
shadowed forms stood, one less digital than the others. Tired but not beaten
he started the ball rolling, "uh, where am I." 

A man trivially replied,
"why in Robotropolis my boy.."  
"Robotropolis, damn, guess my cellphone won't work here.." 
Robotnik was not amused, he pulled Mark up by the collar quite 
surprising him with his strength, then burnt him with a dark stare. Mark
panicked, "Yip, okay, I get the idea," scanning the room to avoid eye-contact. 

Robotnik held him there, allowing him to notice the plastic restrainer collar 
he had used earlier that day, cutting into his neck. The situation was getting
critical, from what he could tell, this guy was the very very serious type. 

Choking now he spat out, "Ok, I see you want to speak, I seem to have a lot
of time suddenly.. honest.. really.. you know once.." Robotnik jerked him,
"you are the pilot right?" He nodded timidly, with a thump he was thrown
back into the metallic arms of the droids. 

He caught a breath for a moment as the local threat fetched something from
the bottom of the room. This allowed him to make a quick survey of the area,
dark, full of monitors, hyraulic doors, control panels, an empty cage hanging
from the roof. Mmm, cosy, basically a classic mad scientist who would....
Suddenly his thoughts were cut as Robotnik masqueraded a device looking
something like an old SeaGRATE harddrive, "well, pilot, you are going to help
me, you see there is a little a something I want off here.. " The ship's
data backup unit flashed as it was rotated, then stepping closer and undoing 
the collar he smiled evily. "and you are going to help me get it.. "

Marken looked at him for a moment, "uuhm, just one small point I would like
to know.. That scientist..guy..person called you Robotnik earlier, and well, 
uum, you see the people that kinda nabbed me didn't seem to work for you..
So I was wondering, why am I here?" 

Robotnik walked over to the now-empty cage, he had exchanged the fox 
for the curiosity that killed the cat. When Sonic boasted he had a hostage
he had immediatly become interested.. and what a surprise it was.. to have
the pilot of a ship with unknown powers.

He smiled at the pilot, "Well, let's say I did a trade. And I'm about to do
another one.. considering I traded something valuable to save you from
the free.. terrorists, you in exchange are going to give me information to
build the weapons on your ship.."
Marken stared amazed at him, this guy sure was evil, he probed a bit.
"And what if I refuse?"
Robotnik exploded "You ungratefull pest, I saved your life, and this is 
how you repay me?" 
He probed a bit deeper.
"And what if I wanted something more?"
The professor grew a grin, "I could gave you anything you want! I could
build you a new ship.. I know you want that!"

He smiled, "Sorry, no deal, a GR members life is worth less than a 
citizens in danger... and I don't see you using my ship's design for airshows!"

Robotnik faced away, "No matter," he punched a button on the comms
system, "Packbell, I need you to persuade someone up here.."

The monitor continued to dictate death, "DTA LOST", Kate looked at Craig.
"Damnit, we have to go after them, I just know something terrible has 
happened to them.. "  Craig rotated his head to look at her, "Kate, 
I understand your anxiety, and that you believe you have the ability to sense
happenings across the vacuum of space.. But you should relax, they have
flown many missions, many of them to Earth before.. " Kate stopped him,
"What if they're not on Earth, after all Paxis didn't hear anything about a 
crashing ship or a great space battle... Craig, what if they are lying on 
some alien ship somewhere, being played with by some evil Cinz soldier?"
He could sense her emotion, but, he was the base commander, and 
a matter in truespace was no matter of his.. in fact.. losing a ship to
true space could prove a rather embarassing situation.

"Kate, we don't want to go jumping into affairs that are not our own,
but, if by the end of the week we haven't heard anything, I personally
will launch.. Okay?" He was good with people, she embraced him--
standard practice for a female human of her culture. 

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 21:00 Mobius Forest 
****************************************************************************** 

Sonic and Sally sat side by side watching the slumbering fox that the scout  
party had brought back. Sleeping beauty, trapped in the realm of dreams.
Bookshire after various examination concluded he had been drugged, though 
there was little proof to support this, but he could offer no other 
explanation. His temprature normal, heartbeat regular and breathing good, 
if by some weapon he had become stunned, it had left no trace -- there
wasn't a sign of any trauma to his body, his furr unsinged, his skin 
unpunctured. Leaving only the possibility of poisoned food. 

And what a poison it must have been, nothing they had tried to rouse him 
had worked, not the three kilometers he was dragged back to Knothole base,
nor the prodding, shaking or yelling. 

Now they had resorted to the last method known, wrapping him in blankets and 
leaving him to come out of his slumber to them. This was something neither 
Sonic nor Sally enjoyed. For Sonic it was the worst, minutes to him felt 
like an eternity, and nothing he could do would make it pass, his mind had
long since passed wondering -- considering every thought he ever had. The war,
the king, his friends, Robotnik.. and this very odd person.

How would this smoothish-furred fox look when their was life in his eyes and
motion in his limbs? What type of person was he, what did he do? And what  
would he do when awake? 

Abruptly he stood up and paced over to the window, looking up at the stars,
the little scene change altered his "prison-sentence" for a while, making it
slightly shorter. He turned his head to look at his prosecutioner, the
sleepy aura pulled him in, sooner or later, probably sooner he too would 
pass out. 

Princess Sally stared endlessly at the fox, it reminded her of someone, 
someone she had once known, many, many years ago. Though if it was him, had 
he not been killed or roboticised, age would have surely taken it's toll. 
And from his skin she could see age was an unpayed debt, as unpayed as 
Robotnik's deeds to the land, deeds that one day in maroon light and 
crimson reflection would be repayed.. with the same coldness he had issued 
them. 

But now was not a time to think, for whoever the fox was it would soon be 
answered, he groaned into life. Sally stood up-- too quickly, and had to wait
a moment as her blood flow equalised, in the meantime however Sonic had not
wasted any time at coming to his side. 

The fox groaned.
Lifting an arm to his face he surveyed it, as if to make sure it was still 
there, as though he expected something different. He grasped his hand in the
air then dropped it to his chest, sighed, took a deep breath, layed back and 
looked up. 

Sonic edged closer, alarming him, he jerked for a moment, closed his eyes
for two seconds, opened them again and slowly began to speak, his voice 
golden and ambient like a warrior or a prince. "My name is Jonathan Righter,
if I may enquire where am I?"

Sonic started, "I'm Sonic, Sonic the hedgehog.." forcing in an answer, "and  
I don't think I could tell you where you are.. " carefully hiding any data. 
Sally paced over to him, "hello, Jonathan, don't worry, you're safe now." 

He flung his head over, causing them both to jump back in caution, 
then, slower this time turned his head up to face her. Mumbling softly and 
apologetically "uh sorry, umm, muscle spasm ..." The two freedom fighters
edged closer, Sally braving to talk to him again. "What happened to you?" 
This time his voice a lot more wavering and uncollected he began his story.
"Well, you see, I was walking along, and then.. uuuhm, well uuh.. actually 
I can't really remember much after that.... uuhm.. not much before it either,
just lots of trees and some factory... and someone.. uuh I hope she's Okay.."
Sonic rolled his eyes, this was the most generalised story he'd ever heard, 
and every moment it went on he trusted this... this outsider less. Sally 
however was paying a lot of detail to the points of it. "Where did she 
live?" 

He paused for a moment, then continued to toil with the thread, "uuh, um, 
well, all I really remember was this big room with her sitting across from me, 
on that greenish chair.. Now, what was that place called, geeesh, I'm sure 
it was the capitol.." Sally's eyes lit up, "Mobitropolis?" Again he stumbled
around thoughts, "uuhm, not sure, uuh, but I would know her place if I saw 
it.." 

Sally extended an arm and patted him on the head, changing her voice to hide 
as much emotion as possible, slowing it, and rubbing his head, "Jonathan, 
if she lived in Mobotropolis... then .. there is a chance that.. the battle
has caused.. the battle.. that she has lost to the battle.." He closed his
eyes, letting out low moans, "No, what has happened.. why? What has become
of .. of.. everything?" 

She hugged him softly, Sonic didn't like this at all, but he let her continue
on about hope and losing people. It ended minutes later with them leaving him  
to sleep and silently closing the door, stepping out into the chilly fresh 
forest air.

As they walked away from the hut Sonic began warning the princess about how
he didn't trust him, and how they should keep an eye out, and Robotnik's 
agents. Inside the hut however Jonathan the Fox reopened his eyes.

They were gone, for now the interrogation had ended, soon they would stop for
good, either accepting or rejecting him -- he had seen it plenty of times 
before. He voted for the former, and with the 'Device' helping him it would
be easy enough to convince them of his good intentions.

A new line overlayed on his vision: "New PDB entry created."  He smiled as 
the "device" did some more calculations, already he
was beginning to know these people, as he gradually built up his 
"Personality Dictator Base" he would be able to predict them, even act like 
them. A sparkle of static overlayed his vision as the videoclip player 
reconfigured itself to the new architechture of his brain, it's luminous 
colours mutating until finally they made up an image. 

It was from the day, the lady... Sonic's friend who had been 
trying to soothe his "most unfortunate loss" was being compared to the 
personality she dictated earlier. Back then, as they hung in the net, she
transmitted negative body language, asserting a level of leadership in the
group. Obviously she was an absolute against this war she'd talked about,
yet she still mantained a softer side.. 

Another PDB was created for Sonic, in a few moments he gathered up 
information on him. A leader, from what he had seen so far, also feeling
strongly about the war, also some type of hero or a holder of a high 
morale/ego -- the way he said his name revealed it. From what he could tell,
the hedgehog doubted him, and/or liked whoever she was.. which reminded him 
to ask her name next time he saw her.

The 'device' added it immediatly to it's list of priorities, wonderfull
little thing he thought. From the day he'd had it installed, after the
'accident' it had served him well, and it could continue to do so for another
two years on the single orb that still retained it's charge. Within that time
he would have to recharge it, not a critical issue, but something he could
begin working on.. tomorrow. 

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 22:00 Robotropolis 
****************************************************************************** 

Huge arcs of energy surged over his skin, enough energy to kill any 
other lifeform instantly with pain, but the "device" protected him from this
by simply filtering any erratic signal going down his neural lines out. 
Marken looked across to Robotnik and Packbell, in his normal relaxed
sarcastic voice he began to torture them. "Geesh, this is terrible, I''ve 
never been so bored in my life.. PLEEAAASE Stop..." Chuckling in 
humour he began to make horrid cracks about androids and drinking
glasses of water.

Commander Packbell was less than amused, this human was beginning 
to really annoy him. To make matters worse nothing they could do would
hurt him, and it seemed that everything they tried only allowed him to 
torture them more. 
On an even worse note Robotnik was beginning to become destructive,
and with him not being able to hurt the prisoner he would sooner or later
begin on him -- a definate problem.

He cranked the power up more, he could almost see the lights dim, 
this human was either mad or simply had no nervous lines. Mark 
smiled up at him and in an impersonation of Robotniks voice started
again. "Carefull Packwell my boy, you'll shock yourself.." He cranked
the power up again.

The voltage reached such a high level that it found it easier to arc 
across to the android than pass through Mark. It struck him on the
arm reeking havoc and chaos across his systems -- he strained 
for a a moment as servos went wild. Then with an heir of finality 
shut off the machine. Once again bringing the human back online.
"Geesh, are you stupid or something, I warned you, but hell no! 
I'm a android, I'm so clever yeah... and you know, I'm not scared 
off anything.. Because I'm so damn clever.."

Robotnik exploded, "roboticize him!  I've had enough of it, just 
robotocise him.. NOW!"

Packbell undid the straps, and pulled him up, once again he 
cracked another line, "Wow, have you heard of decaf out here? 
Geesh, You don't have cell-phones, you don't have decaf, what kind
of stupid planet is this anyway?"

Packbell didn't listen, he simply stuffed his hand into the humans 
offensive mouth and carried him down the hallway to the set of 
cylindrical tubes that layed dormant, just waiting for something to 
do.

They stuffed him into one of these tubes, lowered the glass, and
glared at him. The computer began it's boot sequence, powering
up the giant capacitors that would be his fate. Inside the machine
he gunned out comments like usual. Joking about Microsloth and 
Windoze and the computers they were using. 

Suddenly a giant beam came bearing down on him, but it never 
struck him, terminated by an energy shield not milimeters from 
his skin, the "device" showed it's ability once more. Abruptly the 
beam stopped and the computer echoed a message.

LIFEFORM NOT DETECTED, ABORT, RETRY, FAIL ?>

Mark Yelled at them, "What are you trying to do, just remember
pops, if I go, you'll never get the designs you want.. and if you
tamper with it too much there's a thermo.." 

Robotnik rudely interrupted, folding his hands together in front of
him and pacing forward while grinning evily. "On the contrary my 
dear boy, I will have all secrets after you are my slave!"
He pointed towards where the beam would have hit Mark, "and,
while you may do your little tricks, they won't protect you forever..
Sooner or later, your power will run low, and then, then.. you will be 
MINE!"

Mark reeled back, the "device" abruptly moved all data concerning
reading the data recorder from his mind to it's own 7GB data storage
where it would remain encrypted. In turn he began, "You'll never 
succeed, if your toy even touches me, some thrirty grams of plastic
explosive in my mind will detonate, turning your stupid little fantasy
of me as a slave into potato salad like Jonathan's mom used to make!"

Though he knew this was not the truth -- there was no explosive, it
was still partly true, the "device" had all the information concerning
the SeaGrate drive now, and if he for some reason should come to the
end of organic functioning, the "device" would fail to operate with 
the new systems. To top it, the encryption method it used for 
storing data was "shift bits and play tetris" also, the data was
stored in 14bit bytes, and representations of human storage. Thus,
even if they did decrypt it, only a human mind could read it, only
a human mind like his had similar references to pockets of 
data. Any other human would get garbage.. it was significant only
to his mind mapping.

Robotnik turned away, "carry on Packbell.." Once more the beam
flashed down on him, this time however the "device" was far better
prepared. Having analysed the beam earlier it knew it's type -- 
electromagnetic. Two energy poles formed over his head, deflecting
the beam, which refracted through the glass and passed just 
by Robotnik's head.

Again Marken burst into comment, this time however far more worried.
After all, he should have been, he could deflect the beam only so much
longer before all the orbs lost their power. Right now he had only three
of them left, the third one only semi-charged, it's true energy level 
unknown because of his incapability to test Silicon capacitors which 
kept their power constant until they ran completely out of energy.

"Ok, I feel worried now, I'm willing to tell you how to use the drive,
but.. only if you can sponsor me a ship to take me off this dumb
planet.." He knew they wouldn't keep their promise, but hey, he
wasn't about to keep his either.

Robotnik waved his hand in a motion telling Packbell to cut off the
robotocizer... The android then regained his grip on the human and
carried him back to the main control centre. They sat him down
in front of a computer. "There.." commanded Robotnik, "now, you
will give me the information." Marken smiled, "certainly.. but.." he
pointed to where a keyboard would normally be, "I would prefer an
asci keyboard... please.." 

Suddenly he began shaking his head in small convulsions that soon
became dominant all over his body as he fell backwards off the chair
and smashed his skull against the floor. Packbell looked down at
the crumpled-up pathetic malfunctioning human. "Apparently the
'persuaders' have had a most unforseen side-effect"

Robotnik rolled his eyes as the convolsions ended and cross-faded
into sleep. "Put him in my sick bay, and have two swat-bots guard 
the door. We'll see what we can extract in the morning...." 
Packbell siezed the body and headed towards the door when he
was interrupted again, "Oh, and Packbell my boy, see about getting
a keyboard.. " He nodded and passed out the door carrying the 
limp body.

Marken opened his eyes, he was quite amazed that his little program 
had actually worked, he wasn't one of those .. "coder guys" but, hey, he
could also "grive" at that weird "funk." He stood up and took a look
around, from what he could tell, he was in private quarters. This was
definately not a cell, sure, it had barred windows, but how often do
cells have air conditioning? 

Nice, a vent in the roof, possibly a good exitway, though it posed
a problem as it was rather small. He would find it rather hard to 
squeeze through there while he was human... 

"Well Jonathan, looks like RL10 is about to lose another human, 
but, hey.. who better to become a furry than me.." he humoured
himself as he selected "morph." Then he layed down on the floor,
it had a nice blue carpet, too bad he would mess it up, well, maybe
human blood would wash out of it..

A few moments later he wasn't all that concerned about it any more
as he writhed in crackling agony.

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 04:00 Robotropolis 
****************************************************************************** 
Mark looked over the mess on the floor and up the walls, nope, 
cleaning this mess off would require a laser weapon. Too bad they hadn't
heard of that fangled "new non-stick paint", but seeing that he wasn't going
to be cleaning it, he looked up at the ceiling. Yups, this would be a real 
breeze, climb up into ventilation duct, destroy SeaGrate drive, exit via 
duct, steal ship and get off the planet. He wondered for a moment if his 
plan would allow him time to eat, as his stomach's contents had been 
ejected around there somewere, huh, too bad to let all that nutrition go 
to waste.

He stepped forward but was stopped by a squishing noise, he looked down,
amazingly the "device" had even scavenged enough material to give him 
some "smooth-smooth cool-cool" shoes.. or sneakers as the Americans
called them, below them was some internal organ, he picked it up and 
looked at it for a moment wondering exactly what it was, maybe his liver,
or spleen.. hmm. how extremely fascinating. Another pity he didn't have a
jar to put it in, otherwise he would, the thought of bringing out a morbid 
bottle filled with inards every time someone ate curry REALLY appealed 
to him. 

He scaled the wall, and hanging upside down on the nicely textured 
ceiling, clambered towards the grating, after a bit of messing with it 
he finally opened it and clambered inside. Slamming it back down, a
surge of pain went through him, of all things he had managed to close
his tail in the grate. Cursing, he rectified the problem, then took a moment 
to observe this odd piece of cartlidge. "Great" he mumbled to himself
"what in the hell am I? Some kind of Racoon? Geesh, as if it isn't 
enough trouble having a tie fall in your coffie.."

Now he would be able to enjoy a whole series a interesting activities,
including shutting his tail in car doors, getting his tail caught in elevator
doors, getting shocked to hell when his tail picked up static electricity
from persian carpets. Getting his tail stood on by someone wearing high
heels! And finally his personal favourite, having his tail fall in his coffie.
"Way to go Mark-han.. " he concluded as he scrambled off down the
air-way.

Eventually he arrived in a vent looking down into the control room, 
from what he could see Robotnik wasn't there. So, cautiously he 
removed the grating, lifted it above his head, dropped down, and 
let if fall back into place. 

On the floor he quickly scampered underneath a control panel, inside
it had a metal overhang on which he sat. No sooner than he had become 
comfortable, the doors hissed open and Robotnik resumed his place in a 
chair not two meters away. 

>From Mark the Racoons point of view, this guy never slept, unlike
him, even at that moment the power drain of morphing had begun
to affect him. Repeatly in his mind he odered himself. "I will not fall
asleep, I will not fall asleep.. I ... will not.. fall asleep.." then as 
his new body asserted itself " I will .. not snore.. while .. I sleep."
In a few moments he was a warm bundle of slumber.

****************************************************************************** 

Jonathan was awaken by Sonic and his friend, who, he quickly found
out was called "Princess Sally", they invited him to breakfeast, and
he openly agreed.. after all he hadn't eaten for an entire day. 

At the table he was once more asked about his origin, this time 
however he was far more prepared and confident, he claimed that 
he knew little of where he came from, and that all he could remember
were brief moments of his life... which he preferred not to think of.

In turn he was told the story of Robotnik, the kingdom, the roboticizer, 
armada's of robots and evil plans. The whole time the "device" monitoring
everyone, adding new personalities to his database. Because of this 
ability he was able to detect the negativity coming from the hedgehog.
It seemed no matter what he did or said would change his mind, this
brought to the top of his mind that sooner or later their would be a 
conflict in the group -- Something he would prefer to avoid if possible.

****************************************************************************** 
                              Time 08:00 Robotropolis
****************************************************************************** 
Marken was awakened by violent yelling, apparently Robotnik was having a
little tiffy. "What do you mean.. he just exploded?"  There was a type of
wimpering as one of his subservients tried to explain. "Sir, take a .. look
for yourself.." 

There was a metallic clang as something or somebody was thrown up against
a wall, then a hiss as the door opened and someone walked out, and a type
of subsiding wining softening slowly as it was dragged further away. 

Mark popped out of hiding, "alone at last" he looked around, yupsyipee, they're 
gone. Now, to do something about recharging. There was a type of metering device
on wheels in the corner of the room. He dived at it.

Setting it onto resistance he was amazed that both Earth and Mobius used
Ohms. Then, plugging one probe into a hundred volt DC power supply,
the other on his chest, and the power supply ground on his back, he began to
maneuver them around. The resistance twitched, 6.3MOhms, he moved it a 
bit more, then suddenly, 0.2 MOhms.
"Bing, one hundred volts point five amps, don't let me down now orbies.." he
chuckled to himself. 

A few minutes later the resistance had risen back to normal, he moved the 
electrodes a bit, again the resistance dropped as another power hungry 
orb attained it's charge.. at this rate he would be fully charged in an hour.

Suddenly with a hiss the control room doors opened, in waltzed a very 
peeved Robotnik, who fortunately didn't notice him. The racoon looked frantically
for a hiding place, but there was none. Sooner or later he was going to be noticed,
and he didn't want to stick around to see the consequences. 

Suddenly an image of the android appeared on a large VDU, he spoke with
satisfaction in his voice. "Sir, the new Swat-bots will be quite effective at 
purging them from the planet. I have sent a sweep of them to the Great-Forest."
The hairless rulers voice changed, "excellent.. carry on commander.. carry on.."
With that the image collapsed in on itself. 

The last orb reached it's charge, causing the power supply to emmit an 
exposing beep, with it Robotnik rotated his chair. "Well, well, what have we
here, a little freedom fighter.."

His blood froze, but the "device" didn't, it issued a set of escape sequences 
to his suggestive mind. With it he grabbed a scanner off the table he was on,  
and threw it at the exposed circuits of a computer all the way on the other side 
of the room. The two collided with a spark, instantly the lights went out.
 He ran for the door, pushing the 'open' switch, then scuttled back past 
Robotnik in the dark. 

Robotnik dived out into the passage, screaming orders to his droids, 
"Find him, he can't have got far! Search every room on this floor and triple the
patrols outside." Then a lot calmer.. "I have you now.."

Marken resumed his position below the control panel while the search went on,
the droids searching out every possible room, every possible hook, crack, pipe 
and shaft.. except for one place -- this room. 

Suddenly the doors hissed open, something or somebody entered, and then a
voice he knew as "Packbell" resonated, "we've found him sir."   There was a 
thud as some whimpering creature was dropped to the ground. The result, 
Robotnik detonated.. again.. "this is not him!  Find him, and bring him back here!"

The android responded by picking up the creature and heading for the door, 
Robotnik stopped him.. again. "You can leave him here.." The droid aknowledged
and dropped the prisoner on the ground.. again. 

For a few moments there was a silence as the door hissed shut and Packbell
moved off.. and for a few seconds afterwards the silence remained. Then finally
Robotnik broke it with a calm, collected voice. "I find it difficult to deal with people
when I don't know their name.."  The creature paused, fear in the air. "b..b..b.Barney"
Again there was a chilling silence before the toiler continued. "Tell me Barney, if you
had a switch with three settings on, 1-2-3 respectively. Which one would you select?"
Barney knew what the switch manifested as, for it resided on the rifle that Robotnik 
was now fingering, so as a safety measure he took the neutral path. "Well, it 
d...d..depends on wh..wh.. what you.. wh...whh..want to do w.w..ww.ith.. it.."

Suddenly the chair rotated, there was a scrambling noise of shoes on metal, an
ear-piercing blast followed by a cut-off scream, and finally after the impact of
flesh against metal, a noise that sounded like a fire being extinguished by
water. The grim smell of burning flesh floated over to Mark, he wanted to be 
sick, but the andrenalin rushing through him wouldn't permit it.. "I'd select three
and blow the living crap out of you, you bloated toad!" he yelled to himself.

Robotnik's chair swung back around, "Dispatch, remove a body from here.."

******************************************************************************

****************************************************************************** 
Princess Sally pointed at Robotropolis from the rocky outcrop the three
were now standing on. "There.." Jonathan stopped, in the distance the sickened
image bubbled. It reminded him of a return flight to GRBase-I, a return that had 
shown him the true power of evil. Evil of such magnitude that's even Earths 
agents of eco-destruction would be awed. 

Unclogging his throat and pulling a rich voice he looked at the two freedom 
fighters. "So, there it is, the poisoning blister that juts out our own life-force and
festers on it's own evil.." He liked to speak in a poetic manner, and was usually
quite good at it. Sonic rolled his eyes, he still didn't trust this guy, and knew 
sooner or later they were going to see his real mettle.

The fox sat down on the edge of a large rock overlooking the valley below, 
staring at the city in amazement--it never slept, continually boiled and bubbled
like a witches brew, stirring up chaos for the primary inhabitants of this world.
In the smoke little dots were darting around, supply ships, war ships, whatever,
and every single one of them was a potential threat. 

Sally sat down next to him, she'd accepted long ago the destruction on her world,
and what her mission was, to bring it to an end.. oneday. But from this fox 
emmanated feelings of sadness and loss of such energy that they pulled her back
into the thoughts she had the first time she saw Robotropolis's cloud of evil. 

Sonic sat down too, partly because he could mutually feel the pain, and also, 
because Sal had. He was the first to break the silence, "Jon bud, don't you 
remember this?" The fox faced him, "I know why I would want to forget it.."
Sonic looked down to the forest below, there was nothing more he could say.

For a few more moments there was silence, even Sonic sat perfectly still, 
the fox broke it with a frightened yell. "What in the hell is that?"  Pointing at
a fast moving blob getting rapidly larger and heading to more or less from where 
they had come. The two freedom fighter stood up, holding their hands over their
eyes to get a better look without the glare from the sun. Sonic spluttered. 
"SwatBOTS!"

He sped on ahead as fast as possible to warn the others, while Jonathan 
and Sally ran side by side back to base. It was going to take a miracle to prevent 
them from being crackled and crispied by the end of the day. In the distance they
could already hear bursts of weapon fire. 
 
Running to the max they came to the centre of the chaos, rebels were diving in 
every direction trying to avoid beams of energy. In the panic a small fox had 
stumbled and was now lying crouched down hands-over head futily hoping it
would save him from a blast. Above him one of the droids wasted no time in 
taking aim, in a moment of andrenalin and digital panic, it was all over.

Jonathan's body lay crumpled up on the ground, having used all his speed to
save the fox.. and succeeded, but a price had to be payed.  A few seconds 
later the droid tore as Sonic ravaged through it--In turn, a few minutes later the 
action was all over, the remaining droids either returning to base or lying 
non-functional in scrap heaps all over the forest.

When the blue-disk-of-droid-death finally slowed down he went off in search for
Sally. He found her cuddling a frightened but otherwise okay Tails. "Hey, Sal,
where's Jon?" he enquired, relieved that she was okay.

Princess Sally faced him, a tear running down her soft face, pointing at the
smoking heap with the burning grass around it, she forced out between even 
more tears. "Th.. there.. he saved Tails life, ... pushed him out the way.. and ..
and.. took.. took.."  

Sonic faced away, "No.. No.. NO!" he slammed his fist against a tree "NO!!!"
His mind rapidly boiling with guilt, regret and anger,  if only he'd been faster, 
if only at least he'd got to know him, he was wrong, Jonathan Righter WAS 
a hero. And then finally, Jonathan Righter went out like a hero.. He stopped,
walked over to Sally and Tails, and embraced them both. 

He was about to begin speaking when something stopped him. The body 
moved, the body groaned, the body stood up, and screamed in a voice 
that echoed across the mountains. "NO!  WHY? MURDERERS!  YOU 
WILL PAY FOR THIS!  EVERY LAST INCH OF ME THAT BORE 
TESTIMONY TO WHAT I ONCE WAS WILL BURN YOU!"

Sonic ran over to Jonathan, "Jon? What's up?" But Jonathan just pushed him
to the side and dissapeared off into the bush. Sonic stood up, looked at a very
confused Sally and Tails, and let his mouth drop in awe. Sally looked back at
him even more amazed, beams that size killed people if not cut them straight
in half, and apart from surviving, what was he talking about?

"Revenge?" asked Rotor curiously "but why?" Sally glanced at all of them,
"well, he talked about someone he once knew, maybe when that defective beam
hit him he remembered something.." Bookshire butt in, "good concept your highness,
only one thing point, that beam couldn't have been defective.. When weapons 
fire, they fire with constant power, a few seconds after it shot him, it tore a tree
by me straight in half.."  Sonic spun his head in amazement, "Are you saying that
he's a Robot?"  A bubble of mutter came from the group, Bunnie added to the end
of it, "well, what if it just missed him, I mean it wouldn't kill him, but it sure would
shake him.."   Again a mutter from the group. Sonic finished this time, "well, 
whatever he is, or whatever happened, he's gone of looking for Robotnik, and if
we don't stop him.. " he slammed his hand on the table of the war room to show
what would become of their mysterious new friend.
Sally, added, "That's why we need volunteers.."

Marken crawled back through the air system again, geesh, he smiled to himself,
putting on a ladies voice, "huh, I though he'd never leave.." He pulled forward,
his movements dampened by at least two-centimeters of dust. He looked down
at it, good thing sinusitus can't follow you through morphs, but still, the least 
the search droids could have done, when they searched the system about an 
hour ago, was to clean up a bit. 

Whatever, right now he had to find a way out of here, he'd never believed those
statistics that nuclear plants have twenty-miles of copper wire in then or 
something like that, but whatever this building was, it had enough ventilation 
shaft in it to make.. to make... hmm.. well something with a lot of pipes. 
He imagined sooner or later he would bump into the "Marie Brothers" and "King
Glooper".. 

In the distance he could barely make out a fan, a fan sucking in outside
(and not altogether pleasant) air.

The fox crashed through the woods, in his opinion Jonathan Righter 
died when he was hit by that beam, died when the "device" sucked 
every last bit of power to shield him, died when without the "device"
the last part of his brain it was keeping human lost the battle to the cells
of his new body. Now he was a fox.. his emotions had become that of a
fox, the one bit of his mind that humanly manifested as his conscience--
giving him human feelings was gone. Robbed by Robotnik, stolen by 
evil, leaving him like this.. a tear rolled down his face.. only serving to make
him more angry.. this was not him..

He cursed the instinct of direction he now had that took him back towards
where this had all began, where he'd transformed, and .. where his pistol 
lay..

"Damnit Craig, I can't wait any longer, I'm telling you, he's in pain!" 
around Kate in the operations room, people of every race, type, species
and sex monotonously continued their work of monitoring the Star-base's 
functions. Craig spoke again, "Kate, I feel guilty, but I refuse to authorize
you to take a ship out into the unknown." This time calmer, "Kate, we do
look after our own, and, my ruling stands firm, if they don't reply in a week,
we will scout for them."

Tears of frustation began to roll down Kate's face, "Craig.. The pain I can
feel is so intense, so intense, when ever I sense him, I feel pain, pain
all around him, in him, through him. Craig.. He is pain, anger and frustration
burning like I've never felt before.. Not even on my own homeworld.. "
Her voice began trembling,"MY OWN HOMEWORLD, CRAIG.."

He looked at her again, "Kate, you only serve to make me feel guilty,
you are hurting me, you are hurting yourself.. But we can't live by
emotion, we have to live by logic.."

Kate's eye sparkled, her voice changed, it became calmer, then 
wiping away the tears she continued. "Craig, can I speak with you..
alone.."
"Certainly.."

She led him out to the hangar, and pointed to the Draconis-II, a prototype
jump ship -- designed primarily for true-space flight. Among other things
it was armed with warheads that could 'jump' using gravity to fields 
to almost any location in space. 

"Craig, if on friday we haven't heard from them, we would be using this
ship.. right?" Craig smiled at her, "Yes, if for some reason they don't
respond.. which would be unlikely.. wouldn't it really?"

Kate cut her words into him, "You're afraid, stop hiding it and do something
about it.. You're human for God's sake, even though you doubled your
metabolic rate, you are still a human, a human with feelings. Stop 
behaving like an android."

He stared at her, "feelings cost lives, and I have chosen to run by 
logic."

But once more she was prepared, "Craig, you are afraid! It only takes
an hour to configure the ship, but you configured it yesterday, 
slightly illogical don't you think?" 

He froze, she was right, and he admitted it, "yes, I felt anxious, but
I control my feelings.. A practice you should learn."
"Well", she beamed happily, "your feelings have cost you dearly.."

Before he was fully able to grasp the situation, it had befallen him, 
he'd been shot. Her hand blaster crumpling him up in a stunned
heap on the floor. She stood over him for a while, then, dropped 
something down to him, a shiny silver badge. "Sorry Craig, I guess
I always have been a rebel, you see, I value people more than law.
On my homeworld, against the Cinz, now and forever.."

With that, she walked over to the ship, got in, and took off.

****************************************************************************** 
Jonathan the fox picked up the pistol, checked it's energy.. there it was
ready.. ready to rampage, destroy and murder in an atire that would make
Satan himself shirk. He looked at the gun, it felt odd in his new hands, it 
all felt odd, everything about the situation was odd. He didn't quite feel like
killing anymore, if he did start killing.. logic told him, he would be blasting 
people's robotocized families away. Eventually, his power would run too 
low to permit him to fight anymore.. he would either be killed or 
Robotocized, and if the latter came about, he would end up an unthinking
slave, granting his power of information to the side of evil.

No, he could, would never do that, he would stop it all now.. He pointed the
gun to his head, a brain may die a hero, a body is but flesh. 

He never pulled the trigger though, he just sat there, wondering, 
wondering what Marken's fate had been, pehaps now, he 
wasn't a carbon lifeform.. maybe silicon and plastic, bursting with
evil. 

The "device" would normally have warned him about now.
He was becoming far too depressed.. and every moment he sank deeper 
in the swamp of despair, the pressure increased, until sooner or later he 
would implode. But, no digital overlay had anything to say about it, 
it's power used up on protecting him.. He dropped the gun to face the floor 
as tears ran down his face, his emotions pouring out slowly.

Softly a voice called out, "Jonathan? Is that you?" Out of the bush 
climbed a teenage racoon who glanced over the fox, "Geesh bro, 
what in the hell happened to you?"   But Jonathan didn't answer, he simply
grabbed Mark and embraced him, making his comrade feel even more 
confused.

Grabbing him around the chest and forcing him away, yet still holding him 
within an arms length, Marken began trying to figure out what had 
happened to his friend. "Okay, Jonathan, now I don't have time for the full 
story, so just give me the latest.." 

The fox began, his voice wavering,
"They.. shot .. me.. the.. device.. lost.. it's .. power.. and now... my mind.. 
is.. no.. longer human.." Mark, looked into his eyes, amazed.. "So?"
The fox spluttered out, "So, don't you see? My human mind has died, my
consience is dead.. And.. I feel ..like this.."  Mark, stood for a moment 
digesting the data, then spoke softly, "You don't die with the same cells
you are born with. Your whole life, weak cells die, but the strong suckers
carry on. Our life doesn't work on single cells, but all of them working as a
team.. Can't you see what's happened here? Your cells were just replaced
with those little chemical blops that outnumbered them. Sure.. you might 
feel odd, hell, you might be totally psycho, but no matter what.. you are 
still you.. a bit crazier.. but the same guy who flew against the Cinz forces
three years ago.. and the same guy who's my friend."

Jonathan embraced him.. again. He let out a sigh of relief, "thanks Mark..", 
and kissed him on the cheek. Marken didn't like this, but "whatever", he thought
to himself,  those dudes in the bible used to do that a lot, and as long as his
friend just kept it to that, it would be okay with him. 

A few minutes later whatever tears had fallen had vanished into the ground,
and while Jonathan's new emotions were a bit odd, they were generally 
back to their normal selves.. As such, Marken grabbed his comrades tail,
and began cracking all the jokes about persian carpets, high-heels, 
car-doors, elevators and coffie. 

Suddenly, out of his laughter Jonathan stopped, putting his hands on Marks
shoulders and looking straight at him. Mark hoped he wasn't going to hug him 
again. He didn't, he spoke instead, worriedly: "Shit, we've gotta get back to
base, they'll have a search party out looking for me by now.."
"What? And where are we going to get the ship?" he replied in a low tone.
"No, I mean the guys who chased us.."
"Those morons, what the hell did they want?"
"Actually, they're quite nice, and thought we worked for the guy that 
they swapped you for one of their friends with.."
Marken smiled, "Jon, you are and always will be, no matter how morphed,
terrible at that communication stuff."
"Shut up, I'll explain to you on the way!"

The fox and racoon ran off into the forest, leaving the pistol in the bushes,
heading for Knothole.

From this postion in truespace she could detect nothing, the scanners
on her ship were the best available, but even they couldn't pick up any
intelligent signal out of the electromagnetic chaos of space. 

She locked scanners onto 'Gravity Magnitude Modulation" mode, they
searched for a moment, only however coming up with current GR
transmissions. [Note: GMM is the standard the GR use for transmission,
as gravity fields travel instantly, allowing realtime communication. For
example: it would take 271 Years for GRB-II  transmissions to reach
GRCentral via normal radio, while GMM is naturally instant.]

"Computer, search for all possible life planets within 24 hours at 
speed 150C.." 

The computer seemingly did nothing for a moment, she smiled, 
Marken used to joke that they did it to seem impressive. 
"157 Possible planets found.."
"Oh, shit!"
"Computer, scan current planets for engine traces, or non-standard
entropy."
Once again the ship's computer went to work for a moment,
"Three planets found.."
"Plot otimal course using all three planets.."
"Done."
"Go nav1 to nav3, speed 110C."

From amongst the bushes, Bunnie and Rotor spied the fox and
raccoon, they called up Sally on their communicator, and then 
quickly rushed towards them.

Jonathan was speaking, "..and then it's own army turned in on itself... led by...",  
when suddenly, out of the bush ahead of them Bunnie appeared. For a quick 
instant the two got a fright before the fox finally spoke, "hiya.. what's up?"
Bunnie smiled, "you are hon' if you keep on going down this path.." He 
stared at her shocked, "..and, why would that be?" 
"'Cause" she smiled, "that ain't the way to Knothole.."

Jonathan sighed, "you had me worried for a moment there. If just for a 
short one... Just one thing, who are you?" She beamed, "why, they 
call me Bunnie around here.. Bunnie Rabbot." 
"Aah, well, my name is Jona.."
"..than Righter, I know hon', I know.."
Rotor pointed to the raccoon, "who'd you bring back?"

Before he could answer however, Mark began, looking at Bunnie 
and ripping off her voice he began, "well 'hun they call me Mark,
uum, Marken Psantis that is mind you.." They all smiled, even 
Bunnie, all except for Rotor, "Marken Psantis, I'm sure I heard 
your name some place before.."
Jonathan quickly changed the subject, "well, I guess we'd better 
see the princess?" 
They headed off the path and into the bush, back towards Knothole.
Eventually, after a rather long journey, they arrived at Sally's hut.

Outside they met with Sonic and Sally, who asked a whole 
series of questions, all of which Jonathan either lied about, 
or "toiled the thread" with.   

Then came the introductions, Marken met a whole series of
people, some of them hugged him. He didn't like that.. but
he took it in his stride, "after all" he thought to himself, "you
could be stuck on this planet for the rest of your life Marken Psantis,
natural life that is though.." 

Aftterwards, they stood around in groups talking to one another,
Mark was involved in a very heavy conversation about "anti-static
spray" for his tail, with Rotor when Jonathan broke in. "Excuse me,
Mark, have you met Princess Sally?"
"Princess?"
"Yes."
He reeled around to face her, performed a beautiful bow, 
dropped to his knees, took her hand softly, kissed it, and then 
after a short moment, spoke. "Your highness, I am Marken Psantis."
Sally was amazed, Sonic and Jonathan both rolled their eyes.  

Later on as the sun began to set, Mark found Jonathan sitting alone 
on a log, he walked over and sat down next to him. 
"What's up bro?"
The fox took a deep breath, "depressed, just depressed.."
"Aaaahh... you not still going on about that fox-brain thing are you?"
Jonathan squeezed a blank smile, "thanks for reminding me.."
"Oh come on, geesh, I mean, apart from the fact that we are 
trapped billions of miles away from any other GR planet, stuck
in bodies we weren't born with.. and having to put up with a mad
scientist.. Doesn't mean things are all that bad, it means that 
things are terrible.." the raccoon chuckled, "terrible.."
But Jonathan couldn't let himself be humoured, "we're stuck here..
we're really stuck here.. There's no way out, and we can't trust 
anyone."
"What about these guys.. don't they qualify?"
"That's what I mean, I'm lying to them all.. Spinning lies that
are going to get me back.."

Mark smiled, "Want to see instant solution?"
"You have one?"
"Marken Psantis, always has a solution.. "

With that the raccoon jumped up and headed towards the hedgehog,
Jonathan trailing behind him, hoping he wasn't going to do something
stupid.. "Princess, Sonic, my friend an I want to have a chat with you.."

Jonathan's eyes exploded with fear as the four headed off into Sally's hut.
Siiting across from each other on beds, Sonic and Sally on the one, 
Jonathan and Mark on the other, Mark wasted no time in starting.
 "Jonathan here, is going to tell you a story about a universe far-far away..
aren't you?" 

The fox smiled awkwardly. 
"Well" he said, energising his voice, "there is a group of fighters in a 
universe far-far from here, they are called the GR, or 'Guardians of Reality',
their task is to uphold law an order." 
"And?" asked Sonic.
"And, Jonathan is about to continue" smiled the raccoon.

"And, well, they have these ships, star-ships that can jump from one 
universe to the other with their advanced technology. But they had an 
enemy called the Cinz, who believed that.."
Marken butt in, "who tried to attack a little planet.."
The fox went a sickly colour, "..uuh.. but they failed, as the GR stopped
them just before they could fire their weapons.."
"But.. then.. the GR ship.."
"Then the GR ship gained intolerable damage by being hit by some of 
the explosion's debri. This forced them to land..."
"This caused them to crash into the atmosphere of Planet Mobius..
where their ship turned into a ball of fire.."

The fox went white, he couldn't say anymore, he just looked at his
friend. But his friend just looked back, eventually, the poor fox had to
continue. "They managed to get out of the ship before it crashed.."

Marken sensed that his now-furrry friend could continue no longer, so
he looked at the two freedom fighters. "You probably don't like humans..
can't say I blame you seing what that Robotnik guy is like. Well, the 
pilots were humans, and you caught them with your net. They escaped,
but then you caught one again, you gave him to Robotnik in exchange
for something.."

"Tails", Sally murmurred.

"Yeah, they're a problem, got mine caught in a grate.." Mark smirked, 
"but anyway, this human kinda got on ' no-hair-day's ' nerves, who then 
decided to robodigitize him, or whatever.."

He smiled sweetly at them for a moment, "well, I can tell you, that 
I didn't entirely like him trying to turn me into a robot!"
 
Sonic stood up, "You're a human!?!" 
"No, and yes, mentally yes, physically..", he pulled his tail, "..no!"
Sally stared in amazement at him, "What happened to you?"
"Well, after I refused to give him information on weapons and
stuff, and after they TORTURED ME! Again note that I REFUSED..
I woke up in a room where I was too big to get through the 
vent in the roof..."

The hedgehog looked at him strangely, "Yes?"

"Well, then I kinda did some magic.. and... well here I am!
Oh, and I'm also not cross you nearly got me killed, so you
can calm down Mr Hedgehog."

Sonic dropped back onto the bed, then Sally looked at 
Jonathan, "Are you?.."
Marken spat out, "Come on, you can say it HUMAN. Geesh why
is it that everyone hates humans so suddenly?" 

Jonathan looked at her, "No.. not any more.."
Marken looked at her, "He's a full real-real, fox, aren't you Jon?"
"Well Yes, you see, it started today when that..."

And the conversation went on until the early hours of the morning,
with stories of adventure, daring-raids, crushing attacks and rescues
from both sides. They explained the universe of RL's, the "device"
and the Cinz, and were told about the rebellion, the king, and the land.
Finally the two GR pilots grew tired, Sonic showed them to a hut,
where they collapsed onto it's beds.

Packbell sifted through the data on the backup unit, though what he
was getting was less than usefull. He may have cracked the code 
on it, but the data itself was different. Apparently, all the diagrams
were stored in some format called BMP. From what he'd noticed
so far, two words, always located in the same position in the file,
when multiplied made up a value just smaller than the file by 
1024 bytes-- It had to be some powerfull encryption method!

He'd tried decoding it with every method he knew, fractal, 
LZW (Lorri, Zippie and Wimpie lossless compression), 
run length, 7bit, and even truecolor raw. But nothing
seemed to work. He was sure that the table of 768 bytes had
something to do with it.. but what?

He flipped to another listing, now a file called, VIEWBMP.EXE was
visible. "EXE" his mind boggled, it couldn't be the terrible 'EXCALIBUR'
encryption he had heard about, could it? 

No point in trying that file.

He changed the listing area again, now he was in the listing
called WINDOZE, from it there was another listing called
SYSTEM. He listed the files, a new file type caught his
eyes. "COM"  He'd never heard of 'COM' files before, 
perhaps it had to do with file compression, or maybe even
communications.

No point in trying that file.

Robotnik broke in, "So, how's my favourite android tonight?"
Packbell shrugged his shoulders,
"This isn't all the data, I was unable to find any programs that
would view the data files.. The only file I could even 
consider.. which was hidden, "WINE386.SWP", was
small at 21MB  for a program, failed to run on, 
  "AND", "DIMTEL", "CIRAX", and "NEXGEL" processors."

Robotnik faced the window, there was a dark black cloud
forming on the horizon, he stared at it for a long time, 
then finally turned around, walked over to his seat and sat 
down. "Packbell my boy, it's moments like these that make
me wish I hadn't robotocized all of my prisoners.."

****************************************************************************** 

Jonathan liked it here, there was a brook he could drink from and every tree
was laden with fruit. But from this little eden however, he could still 
find evil, for in this garden of fantasy there was a cave.

A dark cave, a cave that frightened him, a cave that held some primal fear,
whether human of vulpine. He had never been in this cave, he didn't
know what was inside. But in the darkness he knew there was enlightment. 

He stepped closer, a smell like rotten meat came to him, a hinderimg smell,
but something he had learn to bear. After all it was just an excuse to stop,
and he knew, that even if he did turn around to face back to the eden, it
would no longer be there. For intrigue ruled the night and his soul, his 
quest for power.

Heading down the dark bellows of the earth he saw a greenish ambient glow
ahead. A cold glow, a glow that spelled the truth, almost a dark glow.
Coming closer he found it to be the remaining shards of a soul-crystal, like
the one that once hung around his neck when he was in the house of "Righter."  
Alike the one he had left to the 'cave of voices' when he began his quest 
of vengeance on the Cinz. 

He picked it up, a cold chill went through him, in his sleep he whimpered,
and in his dreams a voice called out to him. He reeled around to face 
Katicha. 

He stood in the tweenworld, staring at her, "You're here.."
She smiled, "I always have been Jonathan Righter, I always have.."
"But, the Cinz.. they.. the cave.."
"Bodies are only flesh, collections of protons, neutrons and electrons,  
what makes us who we are is a soul.. The biostream, the power that inhabits
all cells in your body.. even those cells you don't want.." She pointed to
her head.
"I guess you know what happened?"
"Yes, I know.. how do you feel about it?"

He turned away for a moment, then brought his eyes back to her, "I have 
accepted it.. I don't like it.. but.. what else can I do?" 
Her voice went grim, "What is it then that bothers you?"
There was no escaping her, she knew him too well, so, he began.
"I am frightened, I don't want to stay here, I don't want to die..."

She smiled slightly, "Jonathan, a body may live forever, but a soul can't
stay in it for eternity.. You have to face the fact that oneday you too will
be released from your grip on matter.."

A tear ran down his face, "That's what scares me, my whole life I've been
free from the pincers of death.. But what happens after this?"
"Jonathan, that is something you must accept that you will never know, it
is best that you don't know it until the time is right. By questioning it, 
you only poison your body.."
"What do you mean, poison?"

She walked over to him and put her arm over his shoulder, "Your quest for
knowledge must have a limit, without it you rupture the flow of the biostream.
Even now, your body has began to die.."
He stared at her, "dying.."
"Yes. Dying.."

She bent down and picked up a large shard of green crystal on the floor, 
from it came little stars of light, they all formed together to make a 
wall of image. 

It was the hut he was sleeping in, around him stood his friend, frantically
taking his pulse. A middle age raccoon looked over him glumly, then 
turned to Marken, "I don't know what it is.. I've never seen anything like
it, he's burning up, his heart-beat is erratic.." and then, walking over,
putting a comforting arm on his shoulder, "Mark, I don't think he's going to
live long.."
Mark showed his emotions in a way never seen by anyone, "NO!" he shouted, 
"No.. there has to be something we can do?" Tears rolling down his face,
he went over to pat his comrades head. "What if his body is rejecting it's
cells, you know, like when they do heart transplants?" Booksire looked at 
him, "well, that is a possibility.."   
"And's it's one I'd like to play by, what can we get him to help?"

The image disintegrated. Jonathan looked at her, "what can I do?"
She looked into his eyes, "Jonathan, look at yourself, what are you?"
"A human" 
"Exactly, but Jonathan, what are you there.." she pointed to where the
projection had been. 
"A fox?"
"Right, you are what you are, you have to accept yourself.."
"But I have! I have!"

"No Jonathan, you tell yourself you have, in reality however, you despise 
yourself..."
He looked to the floor.. "but.. but.."
Then the lady took his hand, "Come it is time, for you to leave your body..." 
"But, will I ever come back?"
"That" she smiled, "that is your choice.."

Chaos rushed his mind, thoughts, emotions, memories, loyalties, images, faces,
people, time..      Wrapping themselves into his inner thoughts his soul
shuddered, there was so much pain.. So much torture, he could see it all now,
from the day he was born, pain, pain when he wanted to be with Clare, pain
when the Cinz killed her, pain, pain everywhere, pain in his friends, his
homeworld.. but pain in him.. Pain which turned to desire, desire that no 
matter what, told him he had to survive.

It stopped. Lying on the floor of the tweenworld, he looked up at her, "The
pain.. I have so much pain.." She grabbed his arm and lifted him up,"And only
now you have noticed it.."
"But why?" 

She walked over to the far end of the cave, then digging into the ash floor,
she removed a mirror, she brought it over to him. "Because, you have never
before been in a world of such pain.."
"What do you mean, Mobius?"
"Yes.."
"But Mobius.."

She lifted the mirror so he could see himself in it, he stared into it as
she continued. "This planet holds enough pain in it to tear itself in half,
you may have not noticed it, but your soul did. Inside every one of your 
new friends there is a driving urge, friends, family.. Pain Jonathan, more
pain than even you have ever known."

The mirror moved, the image pulled him in, faces all around, faces screaming,
bursting with pain. There were so many people, so many, he couldn't help
looking into them, their memories becoming his. Blood, tears, futility, 
they were all there. Amongst them though there was something else, the cold 
desire for revenge, the same type of desire that drove his sword through the 
last emperor of the Cinz. 

But beyond that, there was something, something he hadn't felt in years,
happiness. Happiness blossoming like a flower in a grave of skulls.

The mirror flashed, it now showed an image of a teenage fox -- him, 
he quickly looked at his body, but it was still human. He looked at the 
reflection again, it was human. Then suddenly, it changed again, reverted
back to that of a fox. The mirror cracked, it's pieces vanishing from
existance before they touched the floor.

He was a fox, and it didn't matter anymore, for whatever he became, he 
would always retain his soul. He turned to Katicha, she grinned, "Now go,
you have a task."

His mind flicked across space as his soul found his body once more.

"He's waking up.." cried Bunnie as the fox groaned out of slumber.
Rotor and Bookshire raced over to him, Bookshire being the first to speak.
"Jonathan, are you okay?"
He nodded, "uuhh, but I've got a mega headache.."
The raccoon smiled, "I might think so, you almost died lastnight.."
Jonathan went a sickly colour again, "it wasn't a dream!"
"No, I wish it were, you really had us worried.."
"Uhuu, um where is Marken?"
"Well, the Princess, Sonic and he all went to Robotropolis,
Mark said something about some backup or a ship or something.."
"Damn, I've got to help them.."
The fox tried to roll over to stand up, but Bunnie stopped him, "wait, sugah,
you ain't well enough to get up yet.."
Bookshire sympathised, "I understand your feelings son, but you have to 
get some rest.."

Jonathan looked at them futily, then with a sparkle of cunning in
his eyes began, "yes,  maybe you're right.. I don't want to die or anything.."
And with that he rolled over and closed his eyes, the three friends watched him
for a while. Eventually Bookshire spoke to them, "well, it looks like that medicine
did it's job, he's going to be just fine." Then picking up a bottle of pills, "just give
him one of these every two hours." With that the raccoon left and went back to
his hut.

"One down, two to go." Kate smiled to herself, that last planet had been
a fat load of use. How the computer ever identified it as a "LIFE-PLANET",
she would never know. The whole surface was charcoal, and floating on 
top of that there were liquid-oxygen lakes. 

Suddenly, something beeped, she looked over the controls, apparently
the computer had picked up some kind of carrier wave. "Computer, 
find source of transmission.."  She waited a moment, "Found,
signal is 200-300 years old, and originates from nav point two." 

"Well, well" she smiled," looks like I found something sentient.." 
"Computer, increase speed to 150C, and direct for Nav Point two direct.."

****************************************************************************** 
                              Time 12:00 Forest
****************************************************************************** 
This was the last thing he wanted to do, apart from the fact that his head
was pounding, he was damp with sweat and moisture he had picked up
from dashing through the forest. He was back in the clearing, Jonathan
looked around for a moment, then stooped down to collect his pistol.
It was still there. 

He looked at it for a moment, then rubbed it dry(er) against his chest fur,
took a deep breath and looked in the direction of Mobotropolis. What was
going to ensue, he was not likely to enjoy.

Pausing for another moment, he inhaled as much air as his lungs 
could hold, and then belted off for the horizon.

****************************************************************************** 
                         Time 12:30 Outskirts of Robotropolis
****************************************************************************** 
Mark looked up at the city, then turning to Sally in disgust began," all 
this, and you can't even order a pizza.." They all chuckled for a moment,
it broke some of the tension.

Abruptly however they stopped, Sonic pointed to a tall building in the
distance.. "That one, Jon?" 
"Yipsyappie, that's the one."
"He's got to have at least a dozen swat-bots over there."
Mark gave Sonic a sickly smile, "uh hu, uh, don't look now, incoming 
6 o'clock"

The hedgehog ripped around to face three swat-bots, as he started up into his
blue-rotor, metal began to fly. More swat-bots came in, Mark began to get  
worried as they came dangerously near to him and the princess, eventually
surrounding them. 

He looked at her quick, "oh gee.. I feel so threatened.." Then picking up a 
piece of rubble and holding it near his chest he gave the "device" a command,
which he said out loud for effect, "explode shields UP!" His shield exploded
into existance--propelling the rubble at a velocity so high that if it
hadn't hit the swat-bot standing five meters away, it would have disintegrated
on it's own accord.

He smiled sarcastically, "Hey, what can I say, I'm a trained professional!"
Even the princess rolled her eyes this time, but not for too long, as more
foolish droids were trapped between the blue-blade of death and the  
particle accelarator raccoon. 

However, all good things have to come to an end, and soon both Sonic and he
found themselves out of playmates. "Too bad, I was just getting to enjoy 
that.." Marken remarked as they headed into the building.

Jonathan staggered into town, he wasn't feeling good, his brain was 
overheating while his body was flushed of energy. But he still kept 
on going, he had a mission, and he was going to see it through, even if
his vision was becoming blurry.

In the far-off distance he could see smoke, someone had been at work retro
engineering Swat-bots under a very short time factor... 
He took another deep breath, switched his pistol on, and then headed off 
towards the battle scene.

"Damn, why couldn't they encode their TV with PAL or NTSC" Kate complained to
herself. She'd moved into range of Mobius's old television transmissions 
about half an hour ago, however, due to the fact that the Mobians employed
an alternate encoding method, she was unable to get anything. 

"Computer" she dictated, "attempt do decode format.."
The computer waited a moment then replied, "Carrier signal lost."
"Damn, why did they have to close down, Computer find another frequency!"
"No carrier signals of sufficient bandwidth to store analog unencoded video
on..."
"Computer, try digital video.."
"No carrier signals of sufficient amplitude found for decoding."
"Computer, identify carrier signals.."

"Signal consistency, one low power 10.3Khz AM band, one low power digital 
128.0Khz band, one GMM digital 3.5Ghz band."
Kate's eyes exploded, "Computer, identify GR signal.."
"GR signal is of type 'data poll' from node titled "Marken Psantis", 
warbling is enabled, node is active."

"Computer, increase speed to 335C, and land at closest site to signal."
"Warning, warbling on node is enabled, would you like to continue?"
"Yes, just go!"

Princess Sally carefully cut wires as she removed the ship's data back up unit
from the computer. 
"Whoa, relax, just cut all the suckers, it's not one of those 'cut the blue 
one bombs'"  
Sally looked at Mark, "Oh yes?" she pointed to a red wire coming from the 
unit and heading into the wall. 
"Uh huh, now what is that then?" 
The princess huffed, "That is an alarm.. Mark."  
"Oh, is the crime around here really that bad?"

"Indeed it is my little freedom fighter" Robotnik glared, his laser pointing
at the three. Mark was the first to react, "please stop, the glare of your 
head is blinding me!" The raccoon edged a bit closer.

"Not so close my furry, I've seen that little trick you can do" Robotnik 
sneered, pointing the gun at the princess, "and if you come any closer, 
I would be forced to.. hurt her highness..."    

Packbell came into the room and stood by the door, Mark smiled at him, "how's
the arm mate?" Even androids are unable to compare an infinitely large 
amount of data in an instant, so he needed some reminding the raccoon 
decided. "Well, I just thought that your arm might be sore, you know, all 
that current and stuff passing through it.."

Packbell stared in amazement, "You're the human!" Mark smiled, "after seeing
what caffeine does to that species", he pointed at Robotniks dome, "I decided 
to slip into something a bit more comfortable.."

Robotnik fired, the beam just striking the wall above Sally's head, Marken 
froze for a moment considering what that shot could have done.. abruptly, for 
the first time in Robotnik's company, he shut up. 

Robotnik gave the rifle to Packbell, and then waltzed over to the window, 
stared out for a moment, then turning around he glared at Sonic. "You
know, today might actually turn out to be quite good. After I rid the planet 
of you hedgehog." Sonic glared back, "I don't think so 'buttnik!"
But the overlord continued unhindered, "..We'll see what the freedom fighters 
have to say when their princess has been captured!" 
Sally looked at him stunned, "In your wildest dreams!" but she secretely
trembled with fear.

"Wait!" began Mark, "What about me.. don't I get a part in this? I don't
believe it, I break in here, bother the hell out of you, plant a bomb of
immense power in your basement.. and I still.."
Robotnik stared in fright for a moment, "Bomb?"
"Whoops, damn, guess we're all going to be carbon-crispies, well, at least
let me tell you, I really enjoyed playing. And you were a great guy and 
all..."
"What bomb is this?"
"Oh well.., " Marken smiled, "I guess seeing that there is no way you can 
get off the planet in the next two minutes, I can tell you that it's one 
of the thermonuclear warheads off my ship.. Fusion type that is, you see
what you do, is take hydrogen gas and ionize it, after it has become 
hydrogen ions, you ionize a bit more, and then a whole series of nuclei 
fuse together to make helium, in the process a great deal of energy is 
released. Now, uuh, I'd just like to remind you that after the planet has
cooled down again, all our atoms should make a nice new world in the 
proximity of two billion years."

Packbell himself froze with fear, all the missiles on the crashed  
ship he'd inspected were wrecked, but he'd never been able to find one of 
them. Little did he know that the missile had been used on the Cinz. 
Mark looked at them both, "well before we all go vapouro,
do you mind if I give you a hug.. I mean after all, we are kind of like,
..were cousins.. you know and all.."

But Robotnik was not shaken, "before demise there is still time to make you
suffer, I'm going to let you see one another die.." 
Marken chuckled, "Let Sonic kill us, or we're going to run out of time!" 

Rototnik glared at Sally, "You know, I knew your father, he was like you.. 
foolish!" Then pointing at her and looking back to the android, "Packbell, 
my boy, will you do the honours?"

He smiled and aimed the rifle for what seemed like an eternity, during which 
time the young princess shuddered with utter fear. There was an explosion of
light as the gun he held blazed. 

Sally opened her eyes,  she was still there, she looked around to see both 
Mark and Sonic also very much in existance. A voice from the doorway called
out, "Miss me?  Hey, I made a pun Mark!" A rough looking fox appeared 
at the doorway, bringing a bit of nature with him in the form of leaves,
thorns and vines stuck in his fur.

Packbell stared at what remained of his rifle as Jonathan walked into the 
room, pointing his pistol at Robotnik. "Ivo Robotnik, I find you guilty on
the charge of treason, retro mechanics, unlawfull rule and murder, you 
are hereby sentenced to death, to be carried out immediately by a weapon 
of GR agents choice.."

He pulled the trigger--too late, Packbell sweeped his legs out from behind, 
he fell backward, the shot went far--striking the ceiling above Robotonik, 
but before the fox's skull had impacted the floor, he squeezed out one 
more shot, this time striking Packbell in the chest. The android's body 
flew back striking the edge of the doorway, Jonathan was knocked out
cold on the hard metal floor, his gun bounced twice before sliding along the
floor and stopping at the feet of princess Sally.

After a moment of hesitation she picked it up, then slowly pointed it at 
Robotnik. 
Mark laughed, "geesh, now what was that you said about the king being stupid?" 
Robotnik stared at the princess, time froze, and for a moment to princess
Sally, it felt like their stares were the only thing in the universe.
Slowly he began backing towards the doorway, while Marken's
voice echoed out, "Shoot him, Shoot HIM!, SHOOT HIM!" 

The ad lib echoing of voices caused chaos in her mind, all the suffering,
pain, killing, destruction... but still she could not bring herself to do
this. But she knew she had to, Robotnik was already nearing the doorway.

She clenched her eyes shut, Time stopped, the trigger clicked as it was  
pressed, the echo of plasma surging from the barrel and a
short cut-off scream resounded off the walls for what seemed like an 
eternity. 

And it was over.

When she opened her eyes again he was gone, the only reminder that he'd ever
been there--a piece of metallic scrap that once manifested as his 
robotocized arm. Mark's voice went serious, "That's for Barney.. the next
one will be for Mobius.."

She looked at Sonic, stunned from what she'd just done, she dropped the gun,
grabbed the hedgehog into an embrace and held him there for what seemed 
like an eternity. Mark picked up the gun. "Nice shooting princess, I 
just know the next time you try that, you'll waste him so bad!"
"What!?!" 
"I said next time you shoot him, you'll kill him for sure.."
"b..b..But.."
"Well the main thing is, you disarmed him.. 'Disarmed' him, get it..."
The princess looked at him, "..but.. didn't I?"
"Nope, you just blew his arm off, if you'd hit him full on, you'd be washing
bits of him out of your hair tonight.."

There was a noise down the hall as Swat-Bots came scuttling up it. Mark 
looked up, "looks like it's time to play again.."

Between cutting blows delivered by Sonic, and burts of 
super-highly-ionized-gas delivered from Marken, Sally was able to look at 
Jonathan. His head was hot, but not as hot as it had been the night before,
he was breathing okay, his pulse was weak but not erratic. She patted him
softly on the head. (and removed a thorny vine from it too!) 

"Holy shit, how many of them are there Bigblue?" Marken screamed, as another
laser was stopped by the "device." Sonic stopped grinding for a moment, 
"We've gotta get out of here!"
"You're telling me.. OK, I'm gonna jump out left from this door, that's where
they seem to be coming from. Grab the princess and fox-brain, busticate that
stupid backup thing and then get the freaking blue blazing laser trailing
hell out of here! Don't worry.. I'll be right behind you.."

Marken watched Sonic cut through the unit, "well, there go any hopes of
getting of this planet" he sighed, "but, hey I like getting shot!" 
He took a breath, brushed his fingers through his hair, smiled, then
dived out, seeing more robots than he'd ever done in his life. Every
one of them with a rifle, but in a digital multitask they were all..well
offline. He then followed Sonic down the passage until they came to a locked 
door. 

The door didn't remain locked for long, as the blue streak tore through it. 
Suddenly he stopped, they were now on a launchpad, about twenty stories up,
and to add to it all, they came face to face with a ship floating in midair. 
"Draconis-II!" Mark yelled as it fired a missile towards them. There
was an explosion as a group of foolish Swat-Bots attempting to sneak up behind 
them turned into shrapnel.

Over the ship's loudspeaker came Kate's collected voice, "Whoo, hello, 
could I interest you in a lift?" 
Mark grinned, "Hurry up and open the doors WOMEN!" 

And that she did, and as the ship flew towards the forest, Marken continued
his joking, this time about interior space, seating in available colours and
why to make sure to get the leather seats if you had a tail.

He woke up in her arms, Jonathan looked up into Kate's eyes, and for the
first time in his life he saw something in them he'd never done before. 
She cuddled him close for at least ten minutes before telling him how 
afraid she was that she'd lose him. 

Outside the ship a celebration was going on, and after a few more minutes
talking with her, he went out to join it. When he emerged from the doorway
there was a cheering as the freedom fighters welcomed him back to the
realm of conscience. 

He smiled like he'd never done before, once again in his life he had those
two feelings that had become so distant to him--Love and Happiness.

Later as that day turned to night, Marken found his friend sat alone on a 
log once more. He sat down next to him, "What's up bro.." 
Jonathan smiled, "Mark, have you ever noticed how beautiful the night sky is?" 
His comrade laughed, putting his hand on his head to feel for a temprature.
They both laughed and headed back to the party...

******************************************************************************

****************************************************************************** 
The Draconis II's plasma-fusion engines whined as they powered up for take 
off throwing dust up into a chaotic state.. 

"Where in the hell is fox-brain?" asked Mark.
Kate just smiled, "relax Mark, I'm in no hurry to get back, after all, I am
going to get court-marshalled.."
He chuckled, "Well, I think I'm going to have a little chat with Craig about 
that.. eh?"

In another part of the forest Jonathan said his goodbye's to Sonic and Sally.
"You're sure you don't all want to come back with us, there's plenty of
planets in RL9 that look like this.."    Sally smiled, hugging Sonic a bit
closer, and what she said echoed in Jonathan's mind as his ship sped away
from Mobius.

"We want to stay here, we want to fight, someone has to stop Robotnik, 
and one day we will. We will continue in honour of those who died for our
cause, for those who no longer have any choice... And in hope of oneday
restoring Mobius and it's citizens to what they once were." 

He looked at the planet growing rapidly smaller, until it's solar system became
just another star in the sky, then finally after a moment of thought, he  
closed his eyes. "Freedom from the evils of men, tortured freedom."
And with that he dropped into the realm of soft untroubled dreams.

The ship that landed at GRB-II a day and a half later however was less than
complete.. a letter on Princess Sally's bed attached to a hemispherical
device summed it up.

Princess Sally,

The device I have left you is part of the
warhead of one of the Draconis II's missiles.  It is 
effectively a port'al spawner. I have programmed 
it with the co-ordinates of my Earth Gate.

If ever a matter of Dire danger should occur,
use it.. Also, protect the device at all costs, it
is the key to my world of humans.. "Earth"

Farewell

The End.. Hope you all enjoyed the story, and in case you didn't I'm

Perhaps they were killed in some accident, and their will stated that 
Uncle Chuck takes care of Sonic. Probably this accident happened when he 
was really young, so he wouldn't have any memory of what happened.

The rule is "no binaries".
This covers any kind of "attachments", no matter how small they are.

Rememeber that a lot of poeple have to download all their mail, and it's not
nice to shove fan fiction and other kinds of attached files down their
throat. That's what we have the FTP/WEB server for. 

You can find sonic files at the following locations:

http://rat.org/sonic/
http://rat.org/pub/sonic/

or you can FTP to rat.org and the sonic files are in /pub/sonic/


Here's how to submit your files.

FTP to rat.org (Netscape can't do it, you need to use a real FTP client),
then upload your files to the /incoming directory.
Then follow it up with an email to rat@rat.org telling me about the file 
you uploaded. Please do this so I can know who uploaded the file in case 
there is a problem with the file.

If you can't FTP your files, just attach them to a mail message and send them
to rat@rat.org

FTP is preferred, but if you can't, then just e-mail.

If I see any more attachments posted, I'll have to start removing people from
the list. Just remember that poor guy with a 2400 baud modem using Eudora who
has to download all his mail in order to read it. It's just not fair to
people. I hope you all agree with me on this.

Give us 'is Email adress then mate, I need someone to test out me moron
mailer on, besides... I might want to post someone a few binary (virus)
releases if I ever do make any. 

Hmm.. well freedom of speach I guess, hmmm.. flaming him would also be
freedom of speach. So what are the nintendo guys into.. the nintendo Sonic.. 
(The one called "Somic" or something, with the square loops :) )
Or is it the good old Merio brothers, yeah.. they don't like Tails, after all,
all they need is a red leaf and they can grow their own.. heheheh.

Guess they must be jealous cause they only grow one tail.. 

Q. Has anyone ever seen Captain-N.. It's kinda odd really though, and this
has to be said. That way before Sonic.. there was a storyline about some
princess who's father was sent to another world, a hero rocks up.. and we
meet all sorts of characters... a buffoon, a clever and strong hero, a young
kid with the ability to fly.. heheh. well you get the idea..    Mmmmm.. I
always did wonder that.. but don't flame me.. I personally prefer the Sonic
storyline..

Cheers

Part 7

     The humans that had once occupied the city of Nilreb were soon
scattered across the Northern Continent.  Sebastian and Alison kept a
small band of them together, and it was their goal to make it to the
western coast, where it was said that the wild forest area offered a
perfect haven, almost entirely secluded from Robotnik's influence.
     "Do you think we'll make it?" Alison asked.
     Sebastian looked at her and smiled.  He promised himself that he
would never come so close to giving up again, the way he had that rainy
night outside of Nilreb.  "I know we will."  He offered his paw.
     Alison took it.  "Let's go, then."

     Knothole mourned the loss of Tolouse, and he was buried near the
Power Ring Pool, where they had set up a small memorial for those who had
given their lives to the cause.  Sally spoke to a gathering of the
Knothole residents, saying that Tolouse would always be remembered for his
devotion to the cause, and that he would be given his proper place in
history when the struggle against Robotnik was finally over.

     Nilreb was eventually rebuilt into another of Dr. Robotnik's "major
research centers," and as far as he was concerned, the humans were done
for.  He would never accept that that many had escaped out from under him.
 Coincidentally, the Freedom Fighters also decided that anybody who asked
would be told that they had no knowledge of humans still living on Mobius.
 Should the wrong pair of ears ever ask, that would give the humans the
best chance of survival.

     The struggle continued.

--- The End.

Part 3

     Dr. Robotnik was sitting in his command chair, drumming his fingers. 
He had been doing so for some time, and Snively was beginning to wonder
just what was going through his mind.  Either he's really concentrating,
Snively thought, or the old fool has finally blown his mind.  Snively had
to cover his mouth to keep from chuckling.
     Finally, Robotnik spoke.  "Snively, tell me again why I'm not
roboticizing those humans in Nilreb?"
     Oh no, not this again.  "Because, sir, you planned to make Mobius a
place where only humans would live, free from all of the other furry
creatures."
     "Yes, yes, but I'm beginning to realize even they aren't worth
saving.  Do you think any of them could ever match my intellect?  Do you
think any of them will ever accurately comprehend my visions, my dreams of
the future?  And what about these reports I keep getting saying some of
them are actually helping other animals?"
     Snively was worried.  If he roboticized all the humans the way he was
doing everybody else, who would be left?  Snively didn't want to live in
such a world.  "But sir, you can't roboticize everybody!  Who would be
around to run the machines?"
     "Me, of course!  And you, perhaps, unless you keep questioning me
like that!!"
     Snively gulped.  "But, but... you can't live forever!"
     "We will see about that.  I have come this far.  Do you really think
that I am going to let something like death stop me?"
     Robotnik fell silent again, and Snively turned back around, unable to
pay attention to his work.  He has blown his mind, Snively thought.  He
wasn't chuckling anymore.
     Robotnik said at last, "Well Snively, I have made up my mind.  You
will excuse me while I go to set up my plans."  He stood and walked out of
the command center.
     Snively sighed.  Sure, he hated non-human animals as much as Robotnik
did, but to roboticize the humans as well?  This is one time where I hope
you fail, Robotnik, he thought.  I don't know how, but I hope you fail.

Part 4

     Sally was using Nicole to studying some information that had recently
been hacked from Robotnik's computers when she heard a knock.  "Come in."
     It was Sebastian.  "Hello, Sally.  I have an idea I want to discuss
with you."
     "Sure, Sebastian.  Here, sit down."  She offered the space beside her.
     Sebastian did so.  "I was thinking about how I could help the Freedom
Fighters, and I would like to offer to train them in the martial arts."
     Sally thought for a moment.  "That sounds like a good idea."
     Sebastian smiled.  "Great!  It's just that I---"  Glancing at
Nicole's screen, his voice trailed off.  A word had caught his eye,
"NILREB".  He leaned over to try and read the rest.  "May I?"
     "Sure," she said, moving Nicole over for him.  "Is there something
wrong?"
     Sebastian read.

     PLANS TO CONVERT NILREB TO MAJOR RESEARCH CENTER UNDERWAY.  SEARCH AND
     ROBOITICIZATION OF ALL INHABITANTS TO TAKE PLACE IN FIVE DAYS.

     Sebastian gasped.  "Nilreb!  Oh, no!"
     "What is it?"  Robotnik seemed to like calling all of his cities
"major research centers", and Sally had figured this was just a plan to
search another abandoned city and then begin rebuilding it.
     "There are people living in Nilreb.  Lots of people."
     Sally gasped.  "Really?"
     "Yes, but that's not all.  Let me explain."  Sebastian then told her
about his time in Nilreb, and what Alison had told him about the city.
     Sally shook her head in amazement.  "So there really are humans left
on Mobius."
     "Yes, and they aren't working for Robotnik.  You must believe that. 
Sally, we need to help them."
     Sally looked at the message on Nicole's screen again.  "Okay, we need
to act quickly then.  This message is dated today, so we have five days to
work with.  Go find Sonic.  He'll find the others.  Tell him we need to
have all the Freedom Fighters here for an emergency meeting.

     One hour later, the Freedom Fighters were all gathered in Sally's hut.
     Sally spoke.  "Okay, please listen.  We have learned that there are
still humans living on Mobius, and that they are concentrated in one city,
Nilreb.  We have also learned that Robotnik plans to have all of them
roboticized and the city turned into another Robotropolis.  We have five
days to make it to Nilreb and figure out how we can save them."
     The newest Freedom Fighter recruit, Cat, asked, "Humans?  Can we
trust them?"
     Sally nodded.  "Sebastian, here, has been to Nilreb and knows one of
them.  Now look, I know what you may be thinking about this, but as always
I expect full devotion to this mission.  If any of you think that you
won't be able to put aside any doubts about the humans, please leave now."
     Nobody left.
     "Okay, we leave for Nilreb tomorrow.  Any questions?"
     Bunnie asked, "What exactly are we gonna be doing over there?"
     "We don't know yet, to be honest.  Once we get to Nilreb, we're going
to meet with a human named Alison.  From there we will see exactly what we
can do.  We have five days to work with.  Any more questions?"
     There were none.
     "Okay, in the morning, we journey to Nilreb.  Thank you all."

Part 6

Day Zero

     "Snively!  Prepare my personal transport.  Today is the day!"
     Snively sighed heavily.  "Yes, sir."

     "Today is the day.  I hope we pull this off," Alison said.
     "Me, too," Sally said.  She pulled out her com-link and checked with
the other humans and Freedom Fighters.  Everybody was ready.

     That afternoon, Robotnik stood on the platform overlooking Nilreb's
town park.  Not many people bothered to show up, he thought.  Fools.  I
only wonder why I did not go through with this sooner.  "Thank you for
coming out here today.  As you know, for the past decade I have strived to
create a perfect world out of Mobius, a world of technological perfection.
 Even now, however, there is still room for much improvement.  Recently, I
came to realize how I could make such an improvement."  He paused,
surveying the crowd the way he always did, eagerly anticipating the looks
of surprise and shock they would have when they found out.  "I have
decided that in order to continue Mobius's movement towards this
perfection, it would be in the best interests to..."  He paused again. 
This was the moment.  "...have all the citizens of Nilreb roboticized and
the city converted to a much needed research center.  Swat-Bots, begin the
procedure."
     Robotnik looked over the crowd ready to enjoy the fear in their
faces.  Instead, he heard a word shouted across the park.
     "NOW!"
     Chaos resulted soon after.

* * *

     Late that evening, Sally, Sonic, Alison, and Sebastian gathered in
the basement of Alison's restaurant, or what was left of the restaurant. 
They felt that they could not have asked for a more text-book victory than
the one they fought for that day.  Within the first half hour, most of the
Swat-Bots were dismantled, either destroyed in the park, or smashed to
pieces using whatever the humans and the Freedom Fighters had at their
disposal around the city.  Robotnik, taken completely by surprise, had
quickly fled.  He later returned with a new army of Swat-Bots, and they
tore the city apart looking for people, but by then the remaining humans
had joined those already safely away from the city.  Alison and the
Freedom Fighters stayed behind, hiding in their respective areas, to make
sure that everybody made it to safety.  Now, it was time for the Freedom
Fighters to go home, and for the humans to go wherever their lives took them.

     "So, Sebastian, are you coming back with us?" Sally asked.
     Sebastian and Alison looked at each other, and once again, there were
ponderings of what might have been.  Or maybe, what could be.
     "Alison...?" Sebastian started to ask.
     "I would love for you to!" she answered.  She walked over and hugged
him.  "I think I'm stating to like you just a little."
     Sonic smirked.  "Aww."
     Sebastian laughed, embarassed.  "I think I will be going with the
others, Sally."
     Sally smiled.  "I had a feeling.  Okay, off with you two.  I hope we
will meet again in the future."
     The four said their final goodbyes, and then Alison and Sebastian left.
     Sonic stretched and yawned.  "Now let's juice back to Knothole!  I'm
gettin' tired of this dump!"
     "Okay, let me call the others."  She pulled out her com-link. 
"Freedom Fighters, we are ready to return home.  I ask that you be at the
checkpoint within the next half-hour.  Please confirm."
     One by one, the Freedom Fighters replied.
     Sally blinked.  That wasn't everybody.  She spoke into the com-link
again.  "Tolouse, please confirm."
     There was no answer.
     "Tolouse?"
     Still no answer.
     "This can't be right, he called right after the initial attack. 
Sonic, do you remember where he was positioned?"
     "Sure thing, Sal!  Be right back!"  He raced up the stairs and out
into the night.  Ten minutes later, Sally heard him return, walking slowly
down the stairs.
     "So what did you...?"  Sally noticed he was carrying something.  She
looked, and dropped her com-link.  "Oh gods, no!"
     "I saw a busted up Swat-Bot, too.  It didn't look pretty."
     Sally thought, He must have been taken by surprise.  She shook her
head, trying not to lose control.  Every war had its casualties, she knew.
 But knowing that didn't make it any less painful.  "Let's... let's get
back to Knothole."
     Sonic nodded and turned to leave, Tolouse's body held carefully in
his arms.

Part 2

One week later.

     Antoine saw him first, while on sentry duty.  He hurriedly took out
his com-link and activated it.  "'Allo, Sonic?  Sonic, come quickly!  Zere
ees somebody in ze forest!"
     Sonic replied and was beside Antoine only seconds later.  "What's up,
Ant?  This isn't another one of your ghosts, I hope."
     "No, no, look!"  Antoine pointed.
     Sonic looked.  "Well well well, we have us a visitor.  Stay here, Ant."

     Sebastian had been walking slowly through the forest when he almost
bumped into something he could have sworn wasn't there a second ago.  The
something spoke.  "Hi there!  Who might you be?"
     Sebastian jumped back, ready to fight.
     Sonic put his hands out in front of him.  "Whoa, easy there, bud! 
I'm not loaded."
     Sebastian looked at Sonic, and relaxed.  "Sorry, you surprised me."
     Sonic chuckled.  "I seem to have that effect on a lot of people. 
Now, who are you?"
     Sebastian extended his paw.  "My name is Sebastian.  Tell me, are you
Sonic the hedgehog?"
     Sonic shook his paw, chuckling again.  "Why, yes, I am," he said with
mock-formality.  But then, he looked at the wolf with a thoughtful
expression.  "Sebastian?  Now where have I heard that name before?"
     "I don't think I know.  I haven't met you before now."
     Sonic thought for a moment, then snapped his fingers.  "Wait a
minute, I remember!  You knew a fox named Todd, right?"
     "Todd?  Yes, I did!  Do you know him?  Is he here?"
     Sonic's smile faded.  "Well, I did know him..."
     Sebastian blinked.  "What happened?"
     Sonic sighed.  "Long story.  Really long.  Listen, would you like to
come back to Knothole with me?  I know Sally would love to meet you!"
     "Knothole?  Yes, of course!  I was hoping I would find it."
     "Heh.  Yeah well, it's not exactly a place you'd just happen to run
into.  We stay nice and hidden.  Have to, you know, with ol' Buttnik
sniffing around."
     Sebastian nodded.
     "C'mon, then, let's go."  As they walked past the watchpost, Sonic
shouted, "Hey, Ant, it's okay!  We're gonna scoot back to Knothole."
     "Ah, okay.  I'll be here, wi' ze eagle's eyes!"
     Sonic smirked.  "Right, whatever.  See ya, Ant!"

     "Sebastian?  Really?"  Sally studied the wolf.
     Sebastian chuckled.  "Everybody seems to already know me, around
here.  And you, you really are Princess Sally?"
     "Well, things being what they are, I'm just Sally for now."
     Sebastian bowed his head slightly.  "Even so, it is an honor to meet
you."
     Sally smiled.  "It is an honor for me, too, Sebastian.   We've heard
so much about you."  Right then, there was a knock at the door.  "Come in."
     Tolouse entered the room.  "Sorry, Sally, I hope I'm not
interrupting.  Rotor just wanted me to tell you that he won't be able to
make tonight's meeting on time.  He... uh... needs to clean up his hut."
     Sally chuckled, imagining why.  "Oh, that's okay.  Tolouse, there's
somebody you might want to meet.  This is Sebastian."
     Tolouse blinked.  "Sebastian?"
     Here we go again, Sebastian thought with a smile.  Turning to Sally,
he said, "Is there anybody here who doesn't know me?"
     "Well, Todd did talk a lot about you."
     "Todd, yes.  Tell me, please, what happened to him?"
     Sally sighed, and the room fell silent for a short moment.  "It's...
it's a long story."
     "That's what Sonic said.  If it's alright, I would like to hear it."
     Sally looked at Tolouse.  "Do you want to?"
     "I could, I guess..."

     Sebastian shook his head.  "I never knew about all that.  Poor fox,
no wonder he was always ready for a fight."
     Sally said, "Sebastian, if I may ask, Todd said you were travelling
with others.  What happened to them?"
     This time Sebastian sighed.  "That's not quite as long of a story. 
Basically, we got trapped and I was the only one who escaped."
     "Oh.  I'm sorry."
     "It's okay.  That's kind of why I'm here.  I would like to help you
out fighting Robotnik, if I may.  I have nothing else to do, now."  He
gave a small chuckle.
     "Well, we'll just have to see," Sally said with a smile.  She looked
out the window, which was showing a darkening sky.  "It's about time for
the meeting.  Why don't you join us, Sebastian?"
     "Thank you," Sebastian said.  "I appreciate that."
     "Great."  Studying Sebastian's vest, she said, "I see you are a
master of Quandolo..."

Part 5

Four days to go...

     "Rotor, are you sure this thing will work?"
     "Of course it will, Sonic.  I do recommend everyone keep their
seatbelts fastened, however.  The ride could get quite bumpy."
     Sonic snapped on the harnesses to the carriage, on of Rotor's latest
inventions.  "Everybody all nice and snug back there?"
     Sally's voice hinted at the nervousnous they were all feeling about
what was certain to be a memorable ride.  "I think so."
     "Okay!"  Sonic took out a power ring and began to concentrate. 
"Let's juice!"
     A blinding flash, a clap of thunder, and they were off...

     There was a knock at the door, and she answered it.  "Sebastian!"
     "Alison we have to tell you something.  This is Sonic and Sally of
the Knothole Freedom Fighters."
     Sally stepped up.  "Nice to meet you Alison, and I wish it could be
under different circumstances, but there's something you should know..."

     Alison sighed.  "I should have known this would happen.  Okay, I know
who I need to call.  I'll see if they can come over tonight..."

     "He's going to what??"  All around the room, people gasped in horror.
     Sally nodded and displayed the message on Nicole's screen for them to
see.  "There is no time to second guess this, so please, listen to me.  We
need to come up with a plan that will not only get this city evacuated,
but will make sure that there is enough time before Robotnik has a chance
to find you.  We need to get started on this plan tonight.  Here's what I
want you to do to begin with..."

     The populous was alerted, and everybody soon understood the gravity
of what was happening.  The city of Nilreb slept fitfully that night,
haunted by dreams of what would happen if Robotnik succeeded in his plan. 
The next morning, however, they awoke with a new purpose:  to do
everything they could to keep that from happening.

Three days to go...

     People were sent to explore the surrounding areas for available
refuge, when the time for them came.

     The Freedom Fighters, together with Nilreb's computer workers, worked
to gleen more information from Robotnik's computers about what he intended
to do.

     Everybody was gathering supplies, looking for ways to use the least
amount of space possible.

     The city was a little quieter than normal, and if the Swat-Bots were
better programmed to recognize emotion, they may have been concerned.  But
they stood their posts, oblivious.

     Back in Robotropolis, Robotnik chuckled, looking over the reports
saying all was normal with Nilreb.  "Just three more days, Snively.  I
cannot wait to see the looks on their faces!"
     A drop of sweat rolled down Snively's cheek.  "Y-yes, sir."

Two days to go...

     Sally, Sebastian, and Alison used the information drawn from the
Robotropolis computers to form a plan.

     Bunnie, Tolouse, and a human named Glyn oversaw the moving of
supplies to a series of underground caves.  A network of tunnels
underneath the city served this purpose well.  As Alison had said, "in
times like this, you take a few precautions."

     Cat, Antoine, Sonic, and the humans Edward and Melissa saw to it that
any questions were answered.  Now was not the time for any uncertainty.

One day to go...

     The blur of preparations were coming to an end, and the plan was
being finalized.

     Most of Nilreb's population would be leaving the city that night,
while those staying behind would attend a special "announcement" that
Robotnik was planning to make at the town park.  Robotnik's plan, they had
found out, was to reveal his plans to roboticize the humans at this time,
at which point the Swat-Bots would storm the crowd as well as all of the city.
     The humans had access to a small collection of explosives, and now,
they would serve a purpose.  At the right time, explosives planted at
certain points in the park would detonate, destroying the army of
Swat-Bots.  Meanwhile, the Freedom Fighters and other humans hidden
throughout the city would take care of the rest.  If all went well, all
the humans would be safely out of the city, and by the time Robotnik was
able to send for more Swat-Bots, the humans would be safely hidden in the
caves or beyond, ready to lead their new lives.

     That afternoon, Sally and Alison talked to the Freedom Fighters and
the humans that were to help in the final execution of the plan.
     "...Okay, are there any final questions?"
     The room was silent.
     "Okay.  Go home.  Get some sleep if you can.  Good luck to everybody
tomorrow."

Nothing for Granted
A Sonic the Hedgehog story
by Kris Kelley

or distribution for profit.

Part 1

     Night time had come, and with it a cold, harsh rain.  He slowly
walked on, unable to see where he was going, not really even caring.  His
group, the group he had promised that he would protect, was gone, fallen
victim to an ambush by one of Robotnik's patrols only days before.  Now,
the only thing that he could still claim his own was his vest, a vest
which stated that he was an expert in Quandolo, one of Mobius's oldest
martial arts.  He knew many martial arts, actually, and had earned many
praises for his skill.  But that was all in the past.  The vest was in
tatters, now.  Having had almost no food or water since the attack, so was he.
     He never thought that he would just give up.  He had vowed that as
long as he was alive, he would do everything he could to keep his group
together, to somehow help them survive in the desolate world that Mobius
had become.  But what can you do when there is nobody to protect anymore? 
His friends were now either dead or roboticized.  Maybe it was time to
stop running.
     When he walked to the top of the hill, the last thing he expected to
see was lights in the distance.  There was a city here!  In all the years
on the run, he had steered clear of the cities.  They were Robotnik's
territory now, each one having been turned into a technological fortress,
run by robots that had once been inhabitants of Mobius.  Now, however, he
saw this city as his goal.  He would simply walk up to the first Swat-Bot
he saw, and surrender.  Surrender, and it would all finally be over.
     He never made it to his goal.  Near the city limits, his legs gave
out from under him, and he collapsed, unconscious.

* * *

     Alison turned off the light, ready for bed.  She looked out her
window, which had a wide view of the land south of Nilreb.  Not that there
was really all that much to see.  Every time she looked out, she saw the
same expanse of plains, stretching almost to the horizon, broken only by a
chain of low mountains far off in the distance.  Now, however, it was
impossible to see even that much, obscured by the darkness and the rain. 
She was just about to turn around and climb into bed when a lightning bolt
illuminated the area for a brief time, and something caught her eye.  Oh
gods, she thought.  There's somebody out there!  Soon she was dressed and
out of the house.
     When she got there, she realized that the figure was a wolf and he
looked badly wounded.  The fact that he was a wolf, however, was enough to
put him in grave danger.  Mustering all her strength, she managed to pick
up the wolf in her arms and carry him to her house, and safety.

* * *

     He woke up fully expecting to be in a prison cell.  What he was not
expecting was to wake up in a warm bed with his wounds bandaged.  He sat
up in surprise, but his sore muscles made him regret it, and he lay back
down again, growling softly at the pain.
     "Hey..."
     He quickly turned to the direction of the voice, and again was struck
by the pain.  "Oh!  Who's there?"
     "It's okay," the female voice said.  "You're safe for now.  Just try
to get some rest.  You almost died out there."  As she spoke, she came
over, and he could now see her face.  When he did, he gasped, eyes open wide.
     "I know," she said, understanding his reaction.  "Don't hold it
against me, okay?"
     "But... you're human!"
     Alison nodded.  "Yes, I am."
     "I thought there were no humans left."
     "No, we're still here, actually, thanks to our 'great leader' Dr.
Robotnik."  These last words were heavy with sarcasm.
     "I don't understand.  He didn't just roboticize all of the humans as
well?  I had been told many times that he had."
     "Who can understand anything that maniac does?  Here, I'll try to
explain it.  All the humans were forced to come here to live right after
Robotnik overthrew King Acorn.  He claimed it was part of his plan to make
Mobius a better place to live, but we all know better.  We've heard about
what he's been doing to anybody who isn't a human."
     "And yet he claims to have roboticized you all?  Why?"
     Alison shrugged.  "Ego?  Who knows?  And he actually has roboticized
quite a few.  That's his standard punishment for any crime.  Or rather,
anything he says is a crime."
     "Such as harboring a wolf?"
     "Well, yes, but I don't care.  I just can't stand around and watch
him hurt people like that, human or otherwise.  I do what I can to help."
     "You must be careful.  If he found out you were doing this..."
     Alison nodded, shivering a little.  "I know, and he's caught people
in the past, but...  I would rather have that fear than feel guilty for
the rest of my life."
     The wolf nodded.  "You are a brave girl."
     Alison shrugged.  "You get some rest, okay?  You need it."  She
turned and walked towards the door.
     "Hey, wait.  I don't even know your name."
     Alison turned and smiled.  "Alison.  What's yours?"
     "Sebastian."
     She opened the door.  "Get some sleep, Sebastian.  I'll be back soon
with some food."  She stepped out and closed the door.
     Sebastian turned on his side, slowly, his muscles still aching. 
Soon, he was asleep again, breathing peacefully, something he hadn't been
able to do for a long time.

* * *

     Days went by, and Sebastian's morale improved.
     Sebastian learned that Alison owned and managed a restaurant by day
("The food isn't that great, but it's a pleasant place for people to meet,
when the Swat-Bots aren't patrolling through it, of course.") while
usually staying at home or helping people ("like you, Sebastian") at night.
     "Have there been many others?" Sebastian asked.
     "A few, though not as many as there used to be.  They usually don't
stay long, since the risk of getting caught is pretty high if you don't
keep moving."
     "Yes, I know all about that."
     Alison learned that Sebastian had trained in martial arts in the hope
of becoming an instructor ("Standing up and fighting for yourself was
something I always believed in, and I wanted to show others how they could
do so.") when the coup hit.  Then, he and a group of others fled and were
always on the move, trying to stay alive and safe from Robotnik and his
army of robots.  "We were doing okay, until a few days ago.  Somehow, we
just walked right into a Swat-Bot patrol.  I managed to get away, but..." 
He shook his head.  "But I was the only one."
     "I'm sorry."
     Sebastian nodded.  "Well, for days I just wandered around.  Then I
saw this city off in the distance and I thought that maybe I should just
give myself up.  I couldn't keep running anymore."
     "I hope you still don't feel that way!"
     "No.  No,  I don't think so."
     "Good!  I wouldn't want all my efforts to go to waste."
     "I just wished I could have helped them."  Sebastian sighed.
     "I know.  Believe me, I know.  But you're still alive and you're
still flesh and blood.  You can still help others."
     Sebastian nodded again, silent.
     "Hey, you can start by helping me.  I need to organize my food
inventory over at the restaurant."
     "The restaurant?  It would be dangerous for me out there, wouldn't it?"
     Alison chuckled.  "Well, yes, if we were to go above ground."  She
motioned for him to follow, and she lead him down to the cellar.  Opening
a door, she said, "This leads directly to the inventory room.  In times
like this, you take a few precautions."
     "I see."
     "Well, let's go!"

* * *

     Several days later, Sebastian decided it was time he should go.  "I
don't want to put you at any further risk."
     Alison nodded.  "I understand.  Do you know where you'll go?"
     "No, not yet.  But don't worry, I'll do my best to survive."
     Alison smiled.  "You will."
     They spent some time preparing some supplies for his journey. 
Finally, when nightfall came, he stood at the back door, ready to leave.
     "Oh, wait a second, I have something for you," Alison said.  She left
the room and soon came back holding a vest.  It was Sebastian's Quandolo
vest, and he could see she had mended it.
     "Alison," he said with surprise.  He put it on and looked it over. 
The vest was in perfect condition.  "Thank you."
     She smiled.  "You're welcome."
     He picked up his bag and opened the door.  He looked back at her, and
for a lingering moment, their eyes met.  There were thoughts, ponderings,
on what could possibly have been, perhaps in another time, maybe under
different circumstances.  Then, the moment was gone.  "Goodbye, Alison,
and thank you again."
     She gave a small wave.  "Be careful, Sebastian."
     Sebastian nodded, and left.

     He stood at the top of the hill, the same hill that he had first seen
the lights of Nilreb from.  He had been wondering where he could go from
here, but without any ideas.  Then, one finally came to him.  He
remembered long ago, when he had heard tales of a group living somewhere
in the Great Forest, fighting Robotnik.  Thinking of no other alternative,
he decided he should try and find them.  He set out towards the Great
Forest, far to the west, the Mobian moon lighting his way.

Or, alternatively, soc.culture.mobius.  And don't forget 
rec.aviation.dulcy (doesn't that thought almost make you shudder?(g)).

Let's not forget the most obvious one: rec.food.chili-dogs.

For those who just won't give up: alt.animals.foxes.sally-acorn.  At 
least there would be less dispute over alt.fan.hff (g)  [For those of you 
new to the list, Happy Fun Fox (hff) was a popular nickname for Tails.  
See the list archives if you're curious.]

Anyone interested in comp.nicole?

Finally, the most important group to add would be sci.the-void from which 
might originate a way to get Sally's father out permanently.

>Anybody have all of the episodes? Checking one last time..... Thanx!

As of tomorrow morning, I'm going to start taping them.  I woke up last
Sunday at 7 am after staying up 'til midnight watching Mad TV to the
melodious sounds of my little brother shaking me and shouting, "Thad!
Happy Sonic!   Happy Sonic!" (we differentiate between the two cartoons by
calling one "Happy Sonic" and the other "Crappy Sonic"...hey, it fits,
doesn't it?!), which I had given him permission to do if he ever saw it on,
no matter how little sleep I'd gotten the night before and no matter how
early it was (the "Cartoon Express" block in our TV listings begins at 4
AM...GET REAL, USA!!!!).  So, long story short, I now know what time the
Sunday Sonic is on in my area, have seen all but the first five minutes of
Sonic's Nightmare, and will not watch Mad TV tonight but instead prepare a
tape and set my alarm for 6:50.

Truer words were never spoken!

P.S. I don't even get the Sonic reruns here anymore. I'm glad my cable
company got bought out. Ever since the merger, we've actually gotten REAL
improvements! Maybe someday.....

Actually, I found my Sonic and Tails "Plushies" right in Software Etc. (They
now rest atop my entertainment center) Now that I think of it, that's the
only place I ever saw them. But I don't go to toy stores very often anymore.
Good luck to you!

This guy is a whacko. I gave up on this kind of negativism a long time ago.
It's pointless and only creates enemies. Hopefully we won't be hearing from
"Clarkmeister" again anytime soon. 

By the way, Ablater, I remember that show. It wasn't bad, but you're right;
those are interesting parallels.....but who knows? Everything's stolen
nowadays, anyway. Either that, or things are just heavily borrowed from.

Hmm.. I have his email adress and perhaps I will do something to him, after all,
I do have a lot of good software to try out. No virus's though, stuff like
hypnotizers (trying to control my family), and some other great mind-mashers.

>By the way, Ablater, I remember that show. It wasn't bad, but you're right;

Here's an interesting idea, imagine the N-Team goes to Mobius, or perhaps Sonic
rocks up in Videoland.. Of course it would have to been fanfic to survive (C)
but it could be real cool. (Imagine Robotnik meating Mother Brain!)
Or perhaps Simon (Belmond not Howes) meating Antoine, 
Sonic and Kevin showing off, 
the princess's,
Rotor and Megaman,
Tails and Kid Icarus... Hmmm.. Snively and Dr Wiley... WOW!

So anyone want to write it.. Actually I have already written a story like
this, but it was a satire, David Pistone ends up in Mobius after he escapes the 
'M-Team' (Who are ticked that he wears a STH shirt) Well.. I guess you should
read it.. but it's kinda weird, that's the reason why it's only 90% complete,
if someone requests it, I will finish it.. Oh yeah, sorry for ripping you off
Bookshire.. hehehe.. I expect to recieve a message to you.. Ohya.. while yer
at it.. what happened to the stories I posted you.. [WAAAAA!]

Now about "Clarkmeister" perhaps he's only seen the Syndicated series, after all
I was kinda like him.. And I'm not a nutcase-- Oh shit.. forgot I am.. well,
perhaps if he knew the storyline he might become a nice guy.. or at least
chance his positioning.. if not then we simply lock my moron mailer on him
and send 
pointless messages for eternity. Ohya. If anyone wants I send you my Sonic Doom 
patch, it'll turn troopers into Tails, and Imps into Sonic. 
(I still find it funny, even after becoming a sympathiser..) 
Ohya as the CyberDemon I put myself in.. it looks real cool.. I think nothing
compares to the rush of shooting your evil clone to death!

Imagine K. Acorn and that Nintendo King dude playing chess in the void!

Yello!  Well, cause I got some spare time on my hands, and though I should be 
'cramming' for the Technical Drawing test tamorrow, whatda hell.. I'll finish
the story today.. Hopefully I'll be able to get all the typos out too, if I
can I will post it tonight .. hopefully.. Oh shit, but it's hard for me to type
now.. my hands are freezing, seems the British weather has drifted down here.
:{

Okay, well I'm going.. darn this will delay work on my third Sonic story..
gee too bad.. OH.. another thing, I will mail this story to the Clarkwaster 
dude, perhaps he will explode or something.. if he returns the mail, then I
will lock my moron mailer onto him for eternity. (Whereby sending him mindless
messages.. forever!)

Huh?  I thought alt.fan.* groups were for people who _liked_ the
subject (with one exception being alt.fan.john-palmer...)

Hello, I'm Brian. This is my first post, so I'll keep it short. I've been

I've been reading my e-mail, so I'm up-to-date.

What an awful idea. Why would anyone hate Sonic?
Personally, I don't care too much for the Sonic games, but I'm pretty 
fond of the characters.

Once again, the credit belongs to whoever put those quotes into the Prodigy
Mail Manager, and not me (although before, I DIDN'T want the credit
associated with me <G>).  Anyhoo, I now am the proud owner of a copy of
Warp Sonic, slightly screwed-up since my VCR is at the moment "screwed,
blewed, and tattooed" (once again, I must credit my words to someone else,
in this case my dad, Fred Boyd).  Luckily, I happen to have two VCR's, and
so now the one that is reluctant to start recording until you hit the
record button several thousand times is the one we use to make copies, and
the other one is the main one.

Hmmmmm...all this conversation about the ol' Captain N show is getting
interesting.  However, I think that if the Freedom Fighters were in the
place of the N-Team, the battle would have been over pretty quick.  I mean,
C'MON, if *I* was dealing with evil clones of my friends who came out of a
dimension where everything's opposite, and they invited all my worst
enemies to a party, *I* wouldn't just tie them up and throw 'em into a
garbage dump world to fight them another day, I'd throw 'em into the warp
to exchange them for their "good twins"!  <Sigh>  I wish that Mega Man had
gotten a better role, in either that cartoon or in the one he's got now...

Hey bud, Sonic didn't crash in '94. I know 'cause I was at the Macy's parade
last year. He crashed in '93 which was the first year he was in the parade.
And guess what, it happened again! The blue blur went down at 57th &
Broadway. It seems he got tangled in the trees and light stanchions along the
parade route, and that pretty much ripped him to shreds. He'll be in it next
year I'm sure, once they get him patched up. Those high winds are murder. I
hope everyone out in cyspace had a happy Thanksgiving. Later.

>>>>>>>>>>>>Blood And Metal Update<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

To be posted on the AOL Sonic Bullitin Boards and the
Sonic Mailing List....

As things like this often do, there were some errors
I made in Blood and Metal after I actually posted them,
dealing with chara design, credits given, and what not.
Being someone who wants to give a story that's as 
contunity sound as possible, I've given three of my
seven chapters revisions that are listed below:

1)  The entire story line will be re-titled, "Blood
and Metal Alpha."  This is because BAM will be a
contuning story, and will be broken off into "books"
denoted by greek letter (for now).  BAM Beta will begin
in December and will introduce a new "Wild Pack" chara,
as well as a "Wild Pack" deiety who takes a liking to
Mr. Crockett.

2)  Davey was in error when he first saw Bear.  To the
normal Mobian, according to Daniel Davis' chara design,
Bear (in fox mode) looks like an 25 year old brown fox.
Davey looked in those Deep Blue pools that Bear has for
eyes, and saw him as somewhat older, wiser, and grayer.
It could be that Davey inadvertingly saw the Hermit
side of Bear, but Davey doesn't know about the Hermit
yat and wasn't sure; he just filed it away into cold
storage for later.  In BAM ALPHA, chapter II, I altered
the storyline to include this scene and get Bear's 
description straight.

3)  Also with Bear, in BAM ALPHA VII, I've got the credit
wrong.  Silly Phracking Me.  So I corrected it.

4)  I noticed that, in a still shot from the Saturday Cartoon
Series, King Acorn is a fox!  Since I wanted BAM to be the
continuation of that series, I had to hake that adjustment.

What I do with these revisions is place them in my WWW Page
[http://users.aol.com/dgonterman] and put a blinking 
"Revised" next to them.  I will also exit the Deluxe Editions
accordingly, if Ratman will allow me to upload the corrected
version of BAM ALPHA I DELUXE into his web page.  I do not
know if Tooner will let me replace the chapters in the 
Archives with these updated ones, but I'll assume that you
have already got them all, and can just download the upgrade
from my WWW Page.

I also tried to answer, a little bit incorectly, about what
the treated bodies from Davey's modified Roboticizer is made
of.. Symon Kielb asked if they were organic.  I answered that
they were a Bio-Genetic Polly-Alloy.  I got the Bio-Genetic
right, but the new bodies are certainly not metallic, as "Polly-
Alloy" would have you believe.  This will teach me never to 
answer E-Mail at 11 P.M, trying to answer something I'm trying
to figure out myself.  What I wanted to say that the 
new flesh is not their original bodies, but artificially made
from the Roboticizing over what is already Roboticized.  That
can be why Bunnie can switch from Flesh to Metal at will.  Note
to Detail Mongers:  The modifications done to the Roboticizer
had the Feedback Loop (Which occurs when Roboticizer meets Robot,
as in Princess Sally #3) in mind and took steps to advoid it.
How, I have no idea.

Thank you for your cooperation as I give my stories some
"Home Improvement"....har, har, har

The Chaotix comic just appeared in my local stores; I was very surprised to
see it this early.

This message contains detailed information on the Chaotix comic.  If you have
not read this book, do not read any further unless you want to see what

Knuckles' Chaotix #1

Fan mail:  none
Fan art:  a) Sonic and Geoffrey St. John
          b) Knuckles and Sally, with hearts between them
          c) Clash of the characters, Freedom Fighters against Chaotix
                FF: Amy, Bunnie, Sally, Antoine, Tails, Rotor, Sonic
                Ch: Knuckles, Charmy Bee, Vector, Mighty, Espio
             Below, Robotnik says, "I can't believe it!  They're
             fighting each other instead of me!


The Chaos Effect, Part 1
========================
The Freedom Fighters go to an amusement park.  Renfield T. Rodent leads
them into the Hall of Mirrors.  Sally doesn't like the way she appears
in the mirror, but Rotor, Tails, and Antoine like the way they appeared.
Sonic senses something is wrong.  Suddenly, a light comes on and the
Freedom Fighters are trapped inside the mirrors.  Robotnik emerges and
tells Knuckles that he and Renfield were responsible.  Knuckles is about
to use his knuckles on Robotnik but finds he can't:  Robotnik also 
transformed Knuckles' body leaving his powers null and void.

The Chaos Effect, Part 2
========================
Knuckles contemplates his situation.  Then comes the grand debut of Charmy
Bee, Espio, Vector (portrayed as a rap musician), Mighty the Armadillo (who
can walk through mountains), and Heavy and Bomb.  Heavy and Bomb say they
were Robotnik's prized robots, but he inadvertently let them gain consciences.
Knuckles doubts them, but they prove themselves by bringing the Chaotix to
Robotnik's power gems and experimental weapons cache.

The Chaos Effect, Part 3
========================
Thinking he has won, Robotnik compliments Renfield on a job well done.  But
Knuckles triggers an alert at Robotnik's headquarters.  Caught off-guard,
Robotnik releases an upgraded Mecha-Sonic.  Charmy Bee and Espio lead the
fight against Mecha-Sonic, followed by Knuckles and Vector, and then Mighty
gives it a final punch.  Just when the Chaotix think they can relax, a large
red mechanoid approaches.  Knuckles himself becomes large using the power gem.
The red mechanoid crashes into the hall of mirrors, setting the Freedom
Fighters free.  Robotnik escapes on a moon rocket but doesn't allow Renfield
to escape with him.  Renfield tries to escape alone but is soon caught in a
cage and taken away.

Archie asks the readers, "Want to see more of Knuckles and the Chaotix?
Write and let us know!"

Tag!  Your It!
/* 

   Spelling error on the credits page.
   
   Title was given as "Tag!  Your It!"  Charmy's ballon correctly says "you're".

*/
===============
The Chaotix frolic in a game of tag.  Charmy tags Mighty, Mighty tags
Vector, Vector tags Espio, Espio tags Charmy, "... and the game goes on!"

The Hunt Is On!
===============
Knuckles races in and informs they are under attack but he's not quite
sure who the attacker is.  He says, "There's a new player in town --
calls himself Archimedes.  It's not clear if he's a friend or foe!".
Suddenly, Vector falls into a deep hole.  As the others prepare to get
him out, they come under attack.  A robot appears and reaches towards
Mighty who looks forward to the challenge of fighting it -- and both end
up on the ground.  Knuckles and Espio begin to run.  When they pause, a
pair of hands appears behind them and silently snatches Espio away.  Now
Knuckles must choose between his friends and protecting the Floating Island.

-> I heard a brief note on the 5 o'clock news that the Sonic balloon in
-> the Macy's parade hit either a tree or a lamppole. Can anyone confirm
-> or deny this?

Back in 1993 he hit a lap post and injared 3 people. But that was
because of hevy winds. It also cut the Bart Simpson ballon and caused
the Pink Panther baloon to allmost hit some people.

Humm. Didn't hear about that. When I saw the earleyer message about the

Does Robotnik have a wind machien?

I'm posting a story entitled "Blue Flames" that my friend Brent "Hedgehog
X" Roberts (NNFW26B@PRODIGY.COM) and I wrote over a year ago.  It's another
of those ones that "doesn't follow the main Sonic thread", so if you're a
purist, you may want to pass it by...thing is, it will probably be
important in at least one of my future stories, and several of my friend
Steve "Maxl" Tramer's, so that's why I decided to "revive" it after so long
anyway instead of just trashing it...Anyway, hope everyone enjoys it!

BLUE FLAMES
by Brent "Hedgehog X" Roberts and Thad "X" Boyd






LEGAL MUMBO-JUMBO

        This work was written by Thad "X" Boyd and Brent "Hedgehog X"
Roberts, and belongs to them lock, stock, and barrel.  You are allowed to
have as many copies (electronic or hard-copy) as you want, and are
encouraged to show it to your friends, but you are not allowed to modify it
or make any money without their official consent (which you're never going
to get just by asking out of the blue, and probably not going to get
anyway, so don't even try).
        To make it easier to distinguish who wrote what, I've headed each
chapter with a different color - darker blue for what I wrote, lighter for
what he wrote.
        Any resemblance between characters in this story and any real
beings, living or dead, is purely coincidental, except in cases when the
character's personality is meant to represent his/her creator's.
        Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who created characters included
in this story.  This includes Service and Games (SEGA), Archie Comic
Publications, DiC entertainment, Capcom games, and a whole bunch of present
and former (mostly the latter, unfortunately [fortunately, however, when
referring to 99.9% of Club X members, since John "King Lawnmower" Geddes
was the only one who I ever respected, and of course I didn't respect him
at the time]) members of Sonic '94/'95 and Club X (normally I'd include
names, but I can't remember them all, and besides, they'd take up too much
space anyway).  Some of the names of the Team X members may be from other
sources, but I'm not sure, since I never thought to ask my enemies where
they got their names.  The name "Kumba" is borrowed (yeah, borrowed, that's
the ticket) from the name of a ride at the Busch Gardens theme park in
Tampa, Florida.
        I'd also like to thank Dave "Bookshire" Pistone for his wonderful
site, and for the creation of Packbell, who makes a brief appearance in the
new intro to this story.





FOREWORD

        What you are about to read is BLUE FLAMES, written by myself and my
esteemed colleague, Brent Roberts, in September of 1994.  The text is the
same (except for a few minor changes I've made to prevent incontinuity, and
you'd need an eagle eye to spot them), but I fixed spelling, punctuation,
and marginal errors.  Also, I've "merged" chapters #10 and #11 from the
original story, since #11 was basically just a retelling of #10, and the
two conflicted at one point anyway.  Also, I combined the original chapters
#13 and #14, into just chapter #12.
        BLUE FLAMES was an experiment; a crossover between our two ongoing
(at the time) storylines.  Part of it occurred in DA STORY -- BOOK 1: THE
SONIC SAGA -- ACT 7: THE TERRAN PLANET, by Brent, and the rest occurred in
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG MEETS MEGA MAN X -- BOOK 2: HEDGEHOG ZERO, by yours truly.
        It was such a success that Brent and I decided to make another
crossover later, which we called DREAMS DISTORTED, but for various
technical reasons (i.e. Brent disappeared while it was being written, and
by the time he got back, our whole outline was ripped asunder because of
changes in the club's membership), it has been canned indefinitely (the
project may continue if I can figure out how to make important changes).
        The reasons for DD's cancellation bring up an interesting point
that applies to this story.  Our policy in the club's stories is for each
member to create a character to be included in stories, but of course,
because of Prodigy's outrageous pricing, these members disappear with an
alarming regularity (and now, let us all bow our heads in homage to the
recent loss of our friends Allen and Jill Quindiagan, who lost Prodigy just
a week or so before my writing this, but let's make the homage snappy,
because this is beginning to become one heck of a run-on sentence).
Because of this, there are many characters in here whose "owners" have
disappeared, yet the characters play such pivotal roles in the story, they
will return in future stories (MTP being a prime example, as you will find
when you read on).
        If you don't know who the third-party characters are, they all
(except MTP) appear in a story called JADED VIEWS...just keep in mind that
in this story, the Freedom Fighters don't know about Hedgehog X's past.
Also, some plot elements will be cleared up in future stories...
        Anyhoo, the basic plot is that Hedgehog X was sent to Earth by
Robotnik in acts 5 and 6 of DA STORY (the exact events can be found in the
prologue, rewritten with a few new characters), and met up with and
befriended some robots there (although not quite himself at the time).
Meanwhile, the Freedom Fighters follow him to Terra to help, but Robotnik
has other ideas, and dispatches a new team of robots to stop them.
        Also, this story was written while Sonic '94 (the name for the
Prodigy Sonic club at the time) was encountering hard times with a rival
club called "X".  The troubles were caused, in part, by me, who didn't
exactly take kindly to an unsavory club with my same nickname.  I admit I
overreacted a tad to what was going on, but I maintain that I DID ask them
NICELY to change their name or refrain from advertising in "my" domain, and
they replied immaturely (and I STILL have the printouts to prove it!).
        What does that have to do with anything, you ask?  Well, several of
the villains herein are adapted from members of Club X, just so I can give
credit where credit's due.
        In conclusion, I'd like to shamelessly plug some of my other Sonic
fan-fiction.  At the moment I'm writing this, a story written by my friend
Steve "Maxl" Tramer and me, entitled JADED VIEWS, can be found on Bookshire
Draftwood's homepage at HTTP://WWW.RAT.ORG/BOOKSHIRE.  Also, expect another
story of mine, THE HUNT BEGINS, to hit before the end of 1995 (that one has
less "third-party" characters than the others, I might add), and two new
storylines -- IGNITION FACTOR, by me, and THE 72 HOUR SERIES, by Steven
Tramer -- to appear throughout '96.
        As always, if you have any questions or comments about any of my
stories, or just want to chat, write to me at AHVT94B@PRODIGY.COM.  Also,
you can drop Brent a line at NNFW26B@PRODIGY.COM.





PROLOGUE
DESTINATION: EARTH

        "AAAARGH!!!!!" Robotnik screamed as he banged his fist on the desk,
breaking it in half.  "Snively, send for maintenance to bring me a new
desk," he ordered in agitation.
        Robotnik had just been foiled again by his two least-favorite
hedgehogs in existence: Sonic the Hedgehog and that purple, secretive one.
His plan to turn the Freedom Fighters against each-other would have
succeeded, too, if that purple hedgehog hadn't found the antidote and
administered it to Sonic and his comrades, with the help of a fox who
looked a bit like the one that always tagged along behind Sonic.  (Robotnik
had observed that this fox was known as MTP, and the initials seemed
vaguely familiar, and that he always carried a jetpack.)
        Robotnik's thoughts of anger were interrupted by a beeping
somewhere in the rubble of his desk.  He rummaged around through the
wreckage, and uncovered a communicator.
        "This had better be good, Packbell," he growled.
        "Oh, it is," the android replied, his image popping up on the
viewscreen.  "So good, in fact, that I'll overlook the fact that you just
threatened me.  The mission to the Little Planet was a major success.
Since our last skirmish there, the Little Planet Freedom Fighters have been
scattered, and the only resistance I met were those two hedgehog sisters
with almost the same name."
        "Amanda and Amy Rose," Robotnik replied without question.  "They
have been roboticized, I assume?"
        "Amanda has.  She sacrificed herself battling me while her sister
ran.  How shweeeeet."
        "And the Time Stones?" Robotnik asked eagerly.
        "All captured," the android replied with an evil grin as he held
the gleaming stones up to the monitor for Robotnik to see.
        "Excellent," the villain replied with a gleam in his eye.  "I think
this will turn out to be a good day after all...see you soon, Packbell."
With that, he switched off his communicator and started formulating a plan
involving sending his nemeses through the space-time continuum...

        "Let's go, gang," Sonic said to his friends.  "Sally's been missin'
for too long."
        "Sally-Girl can take care o' herself," Bunnie said with conviction.
        "Maybe so," Sonic said, "but she'd've tried to get in touch if she
were safe.  I'm gonna go check things out.  If I don't give you some sort
of a message in the next half-hour, head straight for Robotropolis."
        The others nodded their heads in nervous agreement.
        In the treetops above, another hedgehog watched the spectacle.  He
couldn't let this happen, he told himself.  He realized that, after Sally
had served her purpose as bait, she would end up just like his sources told
him Amanda had the day before.  He couldn't let that happen.

        "Prepare to meet your maker, Sonic," Robotnik said, with an evil
grin.  "Literally."  He held up a Time Stone and aimed it at the hedgehog,
who disappeared before the eyes of all present: Robotnik, Snively,
Packbell, and their captive, Sally Acorn, standing in a roboticizer with a
clear-glass cover.
        "What did you do with him?" the princess demanded, after choking
back a scream.
        "He's merely taken a little trip to the past," Robotnik explained.
"By the way, Princess, did I ever tell you how pretty you look when you're angry?"
        "Only a half-dozen times in the past five minutes," Sally snapped.
        Packbell cracked his knuckles.  "She's still got spirit, I'll give
her that," he said.  "Personally, though, I think she'd be much prettier as
a robot."
        "Hard to make the comparison unless we actually SEE her as a
robot," Snively said.  He reached for the switch that would bond flesh and metal.
        "Sorry, bucko!"  Sparks flew everywhere as the roboticizer
exploded.  "Whoops," said Knuckles the Echidna as the smoke cleared, "guess
I'm not very good with machines!"
        Robotnik gasped.  He had planned only to deal with the hedgehogs
and the princess; he wasn't ready for the full band of Knothole Freedom
Fighters who appeared before him!
        Packbell shrugged.  "Slight change in plans," he said.  He snapped
his fingers.  The exit doors closed, and an army of SWAT-Bots appeared
through the hole Knuckles had made in the wall.  In spite of the fact that
the whole team was there, they knew they couldn't take care of all the
robots.  The situation looked hopeless, until --
        "Robotnik!" came a voice.  All heads turned to see Hedgehog X,
wondering how he'd gotten in.  "Let them go!  I'm the one you're after!"
        Robotnik sighed, realizing that the hedgehog could probably nuke
the whole area.  "Fine," he said.  "Snively, let them go.  Packbell, get him."
        All the SWAT-Bots piled out of the building except for one.  The
Freedom Fighters walked out the hole in the wall, but then peered back in
to see the fate of their friend.  Packbell put the muzzle of his gun up to
where Hedgehog X's head was...and it went right through it.
        There was a flash of light, and the hologram disappeared.  The
SWAT-Bot in the corner of the room removed its head, to reveal the REAL HX.
 "Bring Sonic back to the present," he ordered, leveling his gun at
Packbell's head.
        "Fool," Packbell said, "you forget who manufactures those things!"
Suddenly, the SWAT-Bot remains HX was inside transformed, trapping him.
        "As for your friends," Snively said, "our bargain is now void since
you tricked me."  The Freedom Fighters walked back in, held at gunpoint by
the SWAT-Bots.
        "Sonic died millions of years ago," Robotnik said, "but where
you're going, you'll wish you were dead!  Bon voyage!"
        A hole opened in the roof, and the metal encasing HX sprouted wings
and jets, and flew out of Robotropolis...and off of Mobius.

        Of course, Robotnik's mistake, as always, was to leave all his
enemies alive instead of killing them when he had the chance.  Sonic
returned to the present by finding the Time Stones in the past, and he
rescued the Freedom Fighters.
        As for Hedgehog X, he spent his flight wondering where he was
going, plotting revenge, and being thankful that Chaos children don't have
to worry about nourishment.
        Finally, after he didn't know how long, his rocket slammed into
terra firma.  Making his way out of the rubble, he was suddenly grabbed by
humans -- Snively and Robotnik's species, he thought darkly.  They fired
some darts at him, and he lost consciousness.





CHAPTER I
THE SECRET OF MTP

        "No...no...stop haunting me!"
        MTP shot up.  He checked his forehead.  Feverish sweat was pouring
out.  He caught his breath and wondered in terror what this could mean.
        MTP slowly walked into the kitchen.  Knuckles was also drowsy.  "We
gotta stop eating those chili dogs before bed," he groaned.
        "Trust me...it's a lot more than that," MTP replied.  "I'm going
out!" he announced.

        MTP stood in the middle of the wastelands once called Green Hill.
He was digging.  Digging for his past.  He heard shouts from far away.
Sonic was coming.
        "Why did you follow me?" MTP inquired.
        "Because you were acting strangely this morning."  Sonic's voice
took a different tone.  "Tell us the truth!"
        "You can't handle the truth!"
        "THIS IS NOT A GAME, MTP!" Sonic shouted.
        "Do I poke my nose into your personal life?!"  MTP slammed the
shovel down.  Then the floor collapsed, with him on it.  Sonic could only
here a faint, "I'm back."

        CLINK!  HX slammed on the bars.  "What do you want with me?"
        The guard replied, "We want to know more about you."
        HX groaned.  "And I suppose you want to turn me into a robot
afterwards?"  The human gave him a strange look.  HX shuddered.
        "Sorry I won't be able to join the fun!"  He spun and broke through
the bars.  The human got up and tried to shoot him with more tranquilizer.
HX ducked and ran.  "You stay long enough on a planet, you figure things out!"
        Waves of humans attacked as HX ran through the hospital.  Hex's
natural hedgehog agility allowed him to bounce, run, weave, and spin his
way past the flying darts.  Humans got hurt everywhere, but HX was in too
much danger to care.  When he was finally safe, something caught his
eye...a robot about to be hit by a laser.
        "Ugh!  Those animals!" Hedgehog X said, and decided to save the
'Bot, realizing it must have once been a free creature.
        HX ran in, dove, and knocked the robot out of the way.  He heard a
buzz.  Next, a sharp pang in his forehead, a bright light, and then darkness.





CHAPTER II
MTP SPILLS THE BEANS

        "An explanation is in order," Sonic said as MTP recovered.
        MTP was surrounded by the Freedom Fighters.  There was no backing
out.  He had to tell the tale so shocking that he feared for his friends,
especially Kate.
        MTP gulped as he decided to tell the truth...but not the WHOLE
truth.  Even so, Kate might figure out who he was.
        "I wasn't born on Mobius," he began.  Everyone gasped.  "I was born
on a planet called Earth in AD 2000, and was raised in a dojo.  My father
was a master of karate, a fighting style on Earth.  He taught me the art as
I grew up there.  However, that wasn't all I learned.
        "Japan led the world in technology at the time.  Naturally, they
needed to test new products.  When I was in college, I was doing some
research on teleportation, so I tested a giant computer that apparently had
a glitch in it that made it work with 'porting.
        "The computer was originally designed with state-of-the-art VR
technology to actually literally suck the users into it, but somehow there
was also a glitch that made it able to send the users to other locations.
        "I fiddled around with it, and accidentally beamed myself to a
broken satellite, which went haywire and beamed me to a similar machine on Mobius."
        "What's that got to do with the digging?" Rotor asked.
        In response, MTP thrust the shovel into the wall of the pit they
were in.  The wall crumbled, revealing a giant computer.
        "I'm going home!" MTP replied.
        "You can't do that!" Sonic shouted.  "For starters, you're a fox,
and I'm sure there aren't too many foxes on that foreign planet!"
        "But..."
        "And, Robotnik said to HX that he'd be miserable there!" Sally added.
        "It's home, and I'm going!"  MTP stepped into the computer and disappeared.
        Knuckles stepped forward.  "Where do you think YOU'RE going?" Sonic
asked.
        "To rescue that fool," Knuckles said, "and to pay a debt to a
hedgehog that saved ALL our butts multiple times!"  Knuckles followed MTP
into the machine.
        Sonic looked back.  "We're going to take a trip!"






CHAPTER III
THE RAY

        It had been weeks since the renegade robot Sigma's
destruction...and the disturbing return of his spirit (maybe these 'bots
were built TOO well...).  Since then, Mega Man X, the first sentient robot,
and Dr. Cain, the scientist who had found him, had been working on more
pressing matters, as the evil robots (known as Mavericks) were being kept
well under control by the new members of the Maverick Hunters.
        "I've got it," Dr. Cain said.  "A way to revive Zero!"
        "How?!" X demanded, hearing the name of his best friend, who had
fallen in a battle with Sigma's right-hand robot, Vile.
        "Your X-Buster," Cain replied, indicating X's hand, which could
turn into a weapon at any time, "it used to be Zero's.  Using it, you can
zap Zero's memories into this new Reploid here," and with this remark, he
pointed to a Reploid (sentient robot replicating X's design) in the corner,
"who I call Kumba because he has the speed and power of the roller coaster
at Busch Gardens, where I used to go when I was young (and I still do occasionally).
        "However," he said, getting back on track, "it's a
once-in-a-lifetime shot.  Once it's started, it can't be canceled, and if
you miss --"
        "I WON'T miss," X said reassuringly.
        Cain plugged Mega Man X into a machine.  The robot aimed carefully
at Kumba, then pressed the "fire" button.  The X-Buster took a minute to
take in all of Zero's memories.
        Suddenly, a short purple creature with quills on its head and back
ran into the room.  It took one look at Kumba, then dashed into him,
knocking him out of the way of the beam, which fired at it instead of
Kumba.  The creature screamed in pain, then lost consciousness.
        "What's going on?!" Cain yelled.
        Suddenly, security guards ran into the room.  "Dr. Cain!" one
yelled.  "Thank God the alien was unable to harm you!"
        "You mean this creature is an extra-terrestrial?" Cain demanded.
        "Yes," said a guard, "we captured it when it appeared in a rocket.
The queerest thing...it rolled into a ball and sawed right through the bars..."
        "BARS?!" Cain shouted.  "YOU PUT IT BEHIND BARS?!"  His facial
features, including his white mustache and beard, seemed to quiver, and the
veins on his bald head stood out.  "Why did you consider it a threat?!"
        "Well," a guard said, "ummmm..."
        "Nevermind," Cain said.  "The important thing is that we've got to
get it to the infirmary.  There's only one way to get there on time..." he
activated Kumba.  "...X and Kumba have to beam us there."
        "You mean convert your molecules to light without well-primed
teleportation equipment, like the robots do?" the guard asked in horror.
"That's too risky, sir!"
        Cain gave the guard a hard look.  "Not as risky as what you've just
put this creature through."





CHAPTER IV
MIND MERGE

        Kumba grabbed the alien and X grabbed Dr. Cain.  The robots beamed
to the infirmary, converting Cain and the alien to light as well as
themselves.  When they reached their destination they became matter again.
        Cain ignored the headache the travel had given him and connected
the alien to a computer.  He sighed in relief.  "Its life-signs are still
functioning," he said, looking at the monitor.
        Dr. Cain punched some keys, and its thoughts were played out
through speakers.  Two messages came out at once, in the same voice:
        "I'll survive...I have to.  I made a vow to destroy Robotnik...and
there is no way I'm backing down on it."
        "This is incredible...not only am I not dead, I'm ALIVE!  I
breathe!  It's wonderful!"
        "My God," Dr. Cain said.  "Two minds in one!"
        "How in the name of Thomas Light do you know?!" X gasped, referring
to his late creator.  "We don't know anything about this creature...it
might just naturally think two sets of different thoughts at a time!"
        "Yes, but the thoughts are conflicting," Cain replied.  "One seems
to think it's dying; the other realizes it's living!  It must be the
ray...it blasted Zero's thoughts into a living being!  The pain the
creature experienced must have been due to the trauma of having the two
sets of thoughts in unison.  It is imperative that I tune one set of
thoughts out until there's a way the creature can cope with it."
        Cain rapidly pressed keys.  Seconds after he entered his final
command, the creature came to.
        "X!" it exclaimed.  "Dr. Cain!  How did you do it?  How did you
revive me into a living being?"
        "It was an accident," Cain admitted.
        "They were using the X-Buster to beam your memories into me," Kumba
said, speaking for the first time, "but some alien shoved me out of the way
and took the brunt of the blast."
        "I tuned out the alien's memories for the time being," Cain
continued, "so that you would be able to survive."
        "Hey," X cracked, now in high spirits, "since you look like a giant
purple hedgehog and you've got the mind of Zero, why don't we call you
Hedgehog Zero?"
        The creature laughed.  "You've got a great sense of humor, X," it
said.  "So be it...from this day forward, I shall be called Hedgehog Zero!"





CHAPTER V
THE TERRAN PLANET

        Lights started to flicker.  A silhouette of a weird creature
appeared on the computer.  More followed.  The secretaries at  the lab
jumped back as the creatures materialized.
        "Whoa!" Sonic said.  "Some ride!"
        Guards came in through the door, holding guns.  MTP gulped.
"Um...we come in peace?"
        Next thing all the Freedom Fighters knew, they were all in a jail
cell, except for MTP, who was being interrogated.  After the experience
with Hedgehog X, the guards had chained Sonic and Knuckles' spiny forms.
All despaired.
        Bunnie looked at Rotor, who was clearly thinking hard.  "What's
wrong, Sugah'Rus?" she asked.
        "What do you think, Bunnie?" Rotor asked sarcastically, then
brightened up.  "Hey, you can extend your robotic arm, right?"
        "Right."
        "Then try to get the keycard!" Rotor ordered.  Bunnie successfully
pickpocketed the sleeping guard, and let the Freedom Fighters out.
        "What about us?" Sonic asked, pointing to the chains that held him
and Knuckles.
        "Maybe MTP can help," Tails said.





CHAPTER VI
RETURN TO SIGMA'S FORTRESS

        "Okay, guys," Mega Man X said, "this is big.  After the past few
weeks, you've finally got the training you need.  You've earned the titles
of members of the Maverick Hunters' Elite.  Now, it's time for our big
mission...entering Sigma's sunken fortress looking for clues as to his
spirit's whereabouts.  HZ, get yourself cyborg."
        Hedgehog Zero entered a capsule at one end of the room.  He stood
there, his eyes closed, as a blinding white light filled the room.  When he
stepped out, he was half-robot.
        The capsule he had been in was designed by Thomas Light long ago,
to turn the boy Rock into Mega Man.  Unlike Robotnik's machinery, its
effects were not permanent.  Since they were going underwater, the suit was
equipped with a teleporter that would send oxygen from the surface into
HZ's helmet, since he was still partially flesh-and-blood, unlike the others.
        Once fully equipped, X, Kumba, and Hedgehog Zero beamed out to the
location where the fortress had sunken.  "This place gives me the creeps,"
HZ said through his radio to his companions, fingering his arm cannon.  "I
mean, wouldn't it freak you out if you returned to the scene of your death?"
        "It freaks me out," X said, "and I didn't die here."
        "It freaks ME out," Kumba said, "and I've never even BEEN here!"
        The three cut past where X and Zero had hopped flying platforms,
Kumba running straight up the side of the cliff and firing a grapple at his
teammates.
        The trio proceeded until they reached the destroyed entrance to
Vile's former chamber.  One they entered, Hedgehog Zero began to shiver.
        "Uh, HZ," X said, "you don't need to stare at the dead husk you
once were like that."
        "Why can't you just destroy it?" HZ asked coldly.
        "I think it would be wise to send it back to Dr. Cain," X replied.
Kumba fired a teleportation beam at the body, and it disappeared.
        Suddenly, X tensed.  "What's wrong?" Kumba and HZ asked in unison.
        "Vile," X replied.  "His body's GONE."
        The communicators in the Hunters' ears echoed with laughter, and
suddenly there were numerous beams of light.  "Looking for me?" a familiar
voice laughed.  The three whirled around to see Vile with a host of Mavericks.





CHAPTER VII
THE GREAT ESCAPE

        "Does anybody know where the interrogation room IS?" Sally asked.
        "Um, let's ask that doctor over there!"  Tails pointed to a short,
worried man in a lab coat, whose hair -- facial and what little there was
left of it on his head -- was streaked with gray and white.
        The doctor turned around.  "More ET's?" he said.  "You must leave
before they discover you're gone."
        "Right," Tails said.  "Do you know where the interrogation room is,
though?  We need to find our friend."
        "Second door to your left," the man replied.  "Be careful."
        The FF ran to the door.  "Locked," groaned Rotor.  "Can't pick it, either."
        Suddenly, the door blew up.  Kate rushed in and broke the chains on
MTP, who explained his jetpack had reacted to some electromagnetic
interference and caused an explosion.
        Sally, MTP, and Bunnie held the guards off, while Tails and Kate
(whose powers weren't working due to her distance from the Chaos Emeralds)
recovered the equipment the guards had confiscated from them.
        As the Freedom Fighters ran back to get Sonic and Knuckles, MTP
said, "Earth is nothing like it was before.  Lots of time must have passed.
 This is not my home."
        "How do you get off chains on Earth?" came Knuckles' voice from the
room.
        "Like this," MTP said, who ran to the cell where Sonic and Knuckles
were being threatened by humans, knocked the guards down, stole their
lasers, and blasted through the chains.
        "We've got to get out of here!" MTP said.  "This is clearly a
government lab!"
        MTP and Knuckles beat up all the malicious humans they encountered
on their search for safety, trying hard not to kill them, which MTP knew
would destroy ALL their chances of survival.
        "How do we get home?" the teenage fox wondered.  "Last time I
checked, no-one knew about Mobius's existence!"
        "WHAT?!" Sonic gasped.
        "We're stranded," MTP sighed.





CHAPTER VIII
MAVERICKS' ELITE VS. MAVERICK HUNTERS' ELITE

        "What in Thomas Light's name is wrong with you?!" X said into his
communicator, aiming the message at Vile.  "Why can't you Mavericks just
stay dead?!"
        "Vile, you son of a Maverick cur," Hedgehog X growled menacingly.
        "I'm Vile no longer," the Maverick replied.  "The name's King Lawnmower!"
        Kumba scoffed.  "O' All-Powerful Jewel-Studded Grass-Cutter," he
said, his voice oozing with sarcasm, "who are your pals?"
        "Name's NaT," a large bug-like robot said, "and this is my team,
X...the Mavericks' Elite."
        "Would be nice if you changed your name," X replied, "so we're not
mistaken for each-other."
        "I think your a moron!" a Maverick said to X.  Its vocabulary
hardware was clearly flawed, as the message that met X's ears was decoded
as a misspelling.
        "What about my 'a moron'?" X replied.  "I don't own any 'a moron'!
However, I think YOU'RE a moron!"
        "Howz about you just leave the planet?" NaT asked.
        "Poor little baby," another Maverick said, "people confuse Mavs
with him!"
        "Don't worry, guys," said King Lawnmower, "this guy's no problem.
He was a bother to Sigma, too."
        "Ah," X said, "THAT would explain why old Siggy is DEAD."
        "Sigma was a fool," King Lawnmower replied, "but our new master
ain't.  I'm on the winning team now...the team of ROBOTNIK!"
        Hedgehog Zero froze, tensing at the sound of the familiar word.
        "You dirty Maverick," X said in anger, not knowing what was wrong
with HZ but knowing that King Lawnmower had caused it.  "Die...AGAIN!"
 X spoke a command word that activated equipment he had found in a very
special hidden capsule left by his creator, Dr. Light, that called forth a
powerful fireball able to stop even the most powerful foe.
        It was remarkable.  The fireball shot from X's fingertips, as it
had in a few previous battles, but this time, it actually pushed the water
around it away so that it would not be extinguished!  There was nothing
King Lawnmower could do to stop it...he was hit and exploded in a brilliant
flash of fire underwater.
        "The rest of you want to share his fate?" X challenged.
        Suddenly, there was a beam of light, and another King Lawnmower
stood where the last one had fallen!
        "Multiple bodies," X muttered, "same twisted mind.  I believe the
term is 'rIDes'."
        NaT nodded.  "I'd love to stay and jaw," he growled, "but I've got
orders to grab your friend here."  Hedgehog Zero made no resistance as NaT
reached out and grabbed him.
        Kumba fired a beam toward NaT, who held Hedgehog Zero in front of
him as a shield.  The beam hit HZ, and he disappeared.  "Not bad, eh, X?"
Kumba asked.  "I anticipated he'd use HZ to block my fire...so I used a
teleportation beam!  He's safe in Cain's lab."
        "Well done," X said.  "You've learned well, cousin."
        "I'll get you for this," NaT promised.  With that, Team X beamed out.





CHAPTER IX
THE DREAM

        "Where am I?" HX wondered.
        Suddenly, a robot in gleaming red armor appeared in front of him.
"You're...you're me," it mumbled.
        "No," HX replied, "I'M me.  Who are YOU?"
        "I must be meeting the alien that used to inhabit my new body!"
        "I'm not following this too well," Hedgehog X said, his head pounding.
        The robot then disappeared, and images started to flash all around
HX.  The hedgehog didn't recognize any.
        Next thing HX saw, he was lying in bed in a strange room.  He got
up...funny thing was, he didn't WANT to get up.
        "What's going on?" Hedgehog X tried to ask.  He couldn't control
his mouth.
        The hedgehog went through a routine he wasn't controlling.  Then
whatever he was stepped into a capsule, and when "he" came out, HX was a robot.
        IT'S A ROBOTICIZER! HX thought.
        Then HX's body involuntarily sat down in a war room with two other
robots.  HX's mouth moved, and his voice said, "I had a really weird dream
last night."
        "Get used to it," one of the other robots said.  It (he?) was blue
with some white armor, and curled its/his mouth (or whatever) a lot.  The
other robot was a lot like the first, only without the armor, and looked
very stern.
        "What is this?" HX wondered.
        "SHUT UP!" HX's mouth said.
        "Sorry, HZ," the blue-white robot said, apparently taken aback.
        "It's not you, X," HZ (whoever was controlling HX's body) said.
"It's these thoughts.  Maybe it's the hedgehog from my dream."
        "Hey, Zero...er, Hedgehog Zero," the totally blue robot said, "can
you tell us what it's saying?"
        "Okay," HZ assented.
        "Hello, hedgehog," the blue one started to say.  "My name is Kumba.
 This is X, and the other guy in your body is Hedgehog Zero.  What is your name?"
        "Hedgehog X," HX replied.  HZ repeated it.
        "Where are you from?" X asked.
        "A planet known as Mobius."
        "Mobius," HZ mumbled.  "You mean, it's real?"
        "Yes," HX replied.  "Not much anymore, though."
        "Then Dr. Robotnik's discovery was REAL!" X exclaimed, mystified.
        "YOU KNOW DR. ROBOTNIK?!" HX screamed (or tried to).
        HZ looked worried.  "He doesn't sound happy about Robotnik's name."
        "What?  I thought he was only a scientist," Kumba said.  "That is,
until those Mavs mentioned him..."
        "Is Dr. Cain trying to turn a planet into a badlands?!" HX said.
It was unclear whether he was sarcastic or just angry, but there was cynic
in the voice in Zero's head.
        "Maybe HX can help us with this Team X!" Kumba gasped.
        "They need help THEMSELVES," X muttered.





CHAPTER X
THE UNHAPPY REUNION

        "YOU FAILED!!!" screamed a sinister -- and angry -- voice.  "After
all the training I put you through, you failed MISERABLY!!!"
        "Lord Robotnik..." NaT started to reply.
        "Silence, FOOL!" Robotnik screamed.  "Come here!"
        The Team X leader obeyed, fear enveloping him.  Robotnik pointed a
finger at him and said an inaudible word, and sparks flew everywhere as NaT
exploded.  "Thus shall all perish who fail me," he said in a dangerous whisper.
        Robotnik pointed at another Maverick, who looked like X's adversary
Storm Eagle, only jet black.  The Maverick cringed in fear, waiting to
explode like his leader.
        "Fool," Robotnik said, "I am not destroying you...YET."  "You,
Crow, are the new leader of Team X.  Fail, and all of you shall end up like
that fool!"
        Team X, the Maverick Elite, beamed out.

        "You'd think they'd check for bugs," HX said (once his
consciousness had been discovered "awake" in HZ's mind, Dr. Cain had
adjusted his brain so that Zero and Hedgehog X could alternate thoughts at
will).  "Robotnik may be a lot of things, most of which I shouldn't repeat,
but he's usually not an idiot."
        "Just be thankful he DIDN'T," Kumba replied.  "At least we know NaT
is toast."
        Suddenly, there came the buzzing of static from the communicator.
X swore.  "He's found it!" he exclaimed.  "Now we won't know their plans!"

        "We're way off track," Sonic muttered.  "We've got to be on the
other side of the world from Hedgehog X!"
        "Besides," Tails said, "this planet is populated by the same
species as Robotnik!"
        "Maybe so," Knuckles replied, "but we'll find him, whatever it
takes!"  With those determined words, he punched a wall.
        The wall he hit was protected by one of the most dense force fields
known to mankind, powerful enough to keep a robot from beaming through
it...but not powerful enough to stop a hotheaded echidna.  Knuckles hit it
again and again, not having the slightest idea why, just wanting to break something.
        The wall broke to smithereens, and the Freedom Fighters met with
the startled glances of three robots, one of whom looked startlingly familiar.
        Sonic the Hedgehog and the robot who appeared to be the leader ran
toward each-other, both ready to attack.
        "More Mavericks!" X shouted.  "How'd you get in here?!"
        At the same time, Sonic shouted, "You roboticized HX!!!"
        Both paused, trying to comprehend what the other was saying.  HX
broke the silence, screaming, "You're BOTH wrong!"
        The hedgehog explained the Maverick Hunters' Elite to the Freedom
Fighters, and vice-versa.
        Suddenly, an alarm went off.  "Dr. Cain's in trouble!" X exclaimed.
        "Stay here," Kumba said.  The Maverick Hunters' Elite beamed out.
        The Hunters appeared in Cain's lab.  Somehow, Team X had gotten in.
 Crow held his arm cannon at Cain, who had already been beaten into unconsciousness.
        "Do what I say," Crow growled, "or I'll blast him to Kingdom Come!
You have no choice!"  He was right, and they all knew it.





CHAPTER XI
CAPTURED!

        "Did he say 'Dr. Cain?" Tails asked.  When Kate nodded, he said,
"That was what the nametag said on that scientist's coat!  You know, the
one who helped us!"
        "Let's go!" Knuckles said.  The group ran out through the hole in
the wall, and down the hall to where they had seen Cain.
        "Oh, man!" said the Maverick known as Rose as the Freedom Fighters
entered.  "The Freedom Fighters are reunited!  Robotnik will fry us for sure!"
        "Careful when you use that accursed name," Hedgehog Zero said with
an ironic grin.  "KL using it is what brought me back!"
        A quizzical look appeared on King Lawnmower's face, although no-one
could see it through his helmet.  "I don't know what you're talking about,"
he said, "but you can all TAKE THIS!"  With those words, he fired a ray at
the Freedom Fighters that caused them to be rendered senseless until a
human consciousness was sensed in the room.
        "See ya," Crow said to the Freedom Fighters.  "X, Kumba,
c'mere...we're goin' for a little ride."
        Crow dropped Dr. Cain, and Team X beamed out with X and Kumba in
tow.  A few minutes later, humans entered, breaking the effects of King
Lawnmower's ray.
        "Dr. Cain!" a guard screamed.  "Quick, someone get him to the infirmary!"
        "As for you aliens," another guard said as Cain was being taken
away, "you're under arrest for the attempted murder of Dr. Cain!"
        Hedgehog Zero started to say something, but realized it was
useless.  He knew these guards were too thick-headed to believe him.
        The Freedom Fighters were locked away in separate Maverick-proof
cells...but, as was shown before, Maverick-proof things aren't necessarily echidna-proof...





CHAPTER XII
FIGHT TO THE FINISH

        "No human can hold me!" Knuckles screamed.  He pounded on the wall,
crumbling it.  "These humans quite obviously don't know how to imprison us!"
        "Then how come we were trapped before?" Tails asked the echidna, annoyed.
        "The cages you were put in were probably designed for humans,"
Hedgehog Zero explained as Knuckles freed the rest of them.  "Humans are
animals.  These, though, are for 'bots.  The morons think we're Mavericks."
        The team, now loose, raced outside, dodging humans and flying
plasma.  "Stop, Mavericks!" a Maverick Hunter yelled.
        "We ain't Mavericks," Sonic yelled, spin-dodging the weapons aimed
at him, "and we ain't stoppin'!"
        As the Freedom Fighters escaped through the doors, a Hunter tried
to send a message to X.  "Mega Man X!" he shouted.  "Come in!  X, answer
me!  A group of dangerous Mavericks have just escaped!"

        Mega Man X couldn't obtain any transmissions.  He and Kumba were in
cells, similar to the ones the Freedom Fighters had recently escaped, in
Team X's Earth base.

        "He's stirring," a scientist said, monitoring Dr. Cain's condition
on a computer.
        Cain groaned.  He tried to get words out, but couldn't.  He had
heard sounds around him, but couldn't reply to any of them.  He wanted to
scream out that Hedgehog Zero and the other extra-terrestrials were
innocent, for he'd learned of what had happened, but he hadn't the strength.
        "I'll connect him to this," the scientist decided, getting ready to
plug Cain into the type of thought-monitoring device that had been used on
Hedgehog X earlier.  Suddenly, a Maverick appeared and hit his hand away!
        "Gotcha!" said Crow gleefully.  He trapped all the humans in the
infirmary building in capsules, which was what the rest of Team X was doing
to all who opposed them all over the city.
        When the opposition was gathered, the capsules were put near the
town square, including the ones containing X and Kumba.
        King Lawnmower gloated.  "Robotnik is truly a greater and more
powerful master than Sigma ever was!"
        Suddenly, there was an explosion behind him.  Hedgehog Zero had
broken out of his capsule, and was flying towards him, screaming, "Maybe,
but I'm not through yet!!!!!"
        King Lawnmower had quite a sense of dj vu at this scene.  "Now," he
said as the cyborg landed in front of him, "where has this happened before?
 Oh yes, I remember now...right vefore I killed you."
        "Wrongo!" came the reply.  "YOU AIN'T TALKIN' TO ZERO!!!"  Before
King Lawnmower knew what was going on, Hedgehog X had blasted Mega Man X's
capsule to bits, whispered the word to shed his cybernetics, jumped
skyward, rolled into a ball, and sawed his adversary's arm off, destroying
the rocket-launcher on King Lawnmower's shoulder in the process.
        "Big deal," the Maverick said.  "I've already made it clear that I
can use as many bodies as I want with rIDes."
        "You're bluffing," X said smugly.  "I heard you at your
base...Robotnik isn't too keen on helping you out this time."
        King Lawnmower gasped as Mega Man X freed the Freedom Fighters and
Kumba, while Hedgehog X held off the Mavericks who tried to stop him.
        A battle ensued.  However, since the Mavericks basically just
hyperactively bombarded their enemies with insults and weaponry, not really
planning anything (King Lawnmower, with his launcher destroyed, could only
insult them and attempt close-range attacks), so they didn't stand much of
a chance against our sure-footed, quick-thinking heroes.
        Knuckles bashed Mavericks' heads together; Kate and MTP used their
karate expertise (trying not to hurt their feet when they hit the metal); a
pair of insane bystanders blasted several tremendous holes in the Maverick
known as The Great Kazoo, covered one with wax paper, then blew into him,
afterwards saying, "Huh-huh-huh...kazoos suck!"; the hedgehogs sawed
through Mavericks; Tails picked up foes and dropped them; Rotor scrambled
Team X's sorry excuses for brains; and X and Kumba blasted whoever was left.
        When all the Mavericks were about as close to the scrap heap as
they could possibly get without being there, Crow yelled, "We must flee!
Go far, far away...where Robotnik can't get us and neither can they!  We'll
be back, mark my words, FF and MHE!"  Then, those whose beaming abilities
still worked supported those whose didn't, and the whole team left.

        Much later, the Freedom Fighters were ready to return to Mobius.
        "I'm going with you," X decided.  "Robotnik must be stopped, just
as Sigma had to be."
        "I'm going too," Kumba added.
        After getting Knothole's coordinates from the pocket computer known
as Nicole, X, Kumba, and HX/HZ beamed everyone there, although it was rough.

        A voice laughed softly.  "While the hunters are away, X, the
Mavericks will play!"  It was the ghost of Sigma.

Okay, once again, I must shamelessly plug the upcoming story, THE HUNT
BEGINS.  For those of you who scoff at stories that don't follow the main
Sonic thread enough, hopefully this will be satisfactory!  I've put a lot
of effort into it, and it's almost done!

DTR!

No.. it's not a Mortal-Kombat moron asking for the cheats, nor is it a weirdo
desiring the painfull death of Mario.. instead.. it's well.. just a regular.

Here's the grand question that at less than 1000 Bytes, which means it wasted 
about 0.8 seconds to DL it via 14.4K modem!

Q. If ABC cancelled the STH series, does anybody or a team of people, want to
write a fanfic story about the end. Not some cliffhanger, but the full end, 
you know, Sonic spin dashes Snively. Sally gets hold of a Swat-bot laser and
turns 'ol wizardo into a carbon-copy. Good old king Acorn, who is a fox, 
somehow gets free from the void. Sal's mother's story is revealed, and
everything is beautifull and nice. the end.

                                  OR

Snively was far more evil than robotnik, after he blew Sonic in half it didn't
take long before he robotocized the rest of the foolish freedom fighters, and
he became the ruler of Mobius. [If U do though.. well.. heheheh]

So.. what about it.. a final end. THE END. Mobius becomes pwetty, and all
boiwdies tweet once more in twees. Hmmm?

Resistance if futile.
Ablater

.. If this were an actual tagline, it would be humourous.

I looked through some of it while cruising the Sonic site; I'll agree with 
your assessment, but I didn't really like Robotnik being depicted like
in the games, and I got the impression Tales was more of a hanger-on than a 
real friend of Sonic's...

Either it happened off camera, or they didn't want to show it :^)  I just 
finished watching ABC's coverage of it and he was doing fine for the 10 
seconds he was on...

Here's some trivia for you all: according to the parade hosts, Sonic was 
the second largest (in terms of helium used) balloon in the parade 
(Garfield was first), and Macy's parade is the second biggest user of 
helium in the country (world?) - the US government is first.

I was thinking of doing "the end" in multiple time streams (some "what-if"
pasts, such as "what-if Robotnik had attacked ten years earlier?"; some
"what-if" presents, such as "what-if Robotnik had attacked ten years
earlier"; some "what-if" futures, and some possible futures, which I'm not
giving examples of) last August, but after I got a terrible sunburn, a
better storyline somehow sprung to mind (you're forced to think a lot when
you can't move without hurting yourself), and so I'm writing that one first.

Alas, I've stumbled into a severe patch of writer's block.  This doesn't
happen to me much, but when it does....arrgh.  I've figured out what I want
to do with the beginning and end, but I've gotten trapped in the middle
again.  

So, I'm afraid the next stirring installment of `Everthing Changes' won't
be out until (at the most, hopefully) the middle of December.  Sorry.

Someone was talking about STH comics and subscriptions, I would have taken

Oh ya, I live in South Africa, where the buffalo roam and the lions.. well

Sh*t, I'm beginning to sound like a moron. Please, don't complain, I know

Subject: Nothing for Granted: Author's comments

Hello all.

Several people have asked me why I wrote "Nothing for Granted" the way I did,
and I figured that the list would be the best place to reply to them all.
For those who don't care, just skip this. :)

People seem to have been worried about me ever since I claimed that "On My
Mother's Grave" was my last story and at the same time, I stopped role-playing
as Tolouse on FurToonia.  Then, when I said I didn't wish for anyone else to
use Tolouse in their stories, they felt I was being selfish and angrily accused
me of such.  Now that "Nothing for Granted" is out and Tolouse is dead, they
have claimed that I destroyed a great character all because of that depression
and selfishness.

First of all, let me say why I felt that OMMG would be my last:  I had run
out of story ideas, quite simply.  The ideas for the first three stories all
hit me within a few weeks of each other, but then, months later, when I finally
got the last one finished, nothing more had come up.  I am not the type who
can sit down and crank out stories like some authors can; I have to let them
come to me.  Otherwise, it feels forced, or it just doesn't happen at all.
Also, I quit role-playing Tolouse on FurToonia because of this:  I never was
very much into RPGs, MUDs, Magic and other such card games, or any of that.
I decided to try it in FurToonia because I was an avid fan of Sonic stuff.
But my interest in the RPing waned, and I felt that to stay around in an
environment that I had little interest in would only be wastin my and
everybody else's time.

As for why I didn't wish others to use Tolouse in the meantime:  Back when
I first came up with the idea for the character, I knew how I would want
to write him.  David Pistone knows a little about this, as I explained to
him what I figured Tolouse's chronology would be in the stories back when I
first met him as Bookshire in FurToonia.  So, even tho' I didn't plan on writing
any more at the time, I did want to keep the window open so that I could write
the character the way I wanted to.  I guess at this point I should apologize
for claiming OMMG was my last when I should have said that it was simply the
last I had planned at the time.

Now, about NfG:  This isn't the way I had originally planned for Tolouse to
have his final journey.  But the more I thought about it, the more I liked it
better this way.  Mobius is going through a war right now.  So much is
happening, and so much can happen.  The good guys will not always come through
unscathed.  Even the simplest of victories will have casualties, and those
casualties could just as easily be the characters that you feel nothing would
happen to, rather than the "walk-ons" that exist only for the purpose of getting
bumped off.  In other words, in a time of war, take nothing for granted.

Well, I hope this clears a few things up, and I hope that I am not the most
hated person in Sonic fan-fic, now.  It would be a shame to think that I
created enemies simply because of a fictional character. :)

I'll remove my correspondent's address to protect the innocent/guilty and 
so you can flame me for this being off-topic, but I thought it might be of
interest...

The only comment I'll make is that as long as these "other inert gases" 
aren't things like chlorine, carbon monoxide, or hydrogen sulfide (none of 
which are really inert :^)), then I don't know what would be dangerous 
about inhaling party helium (but don't sue me if you do and it kills you :^))

RDB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Here's some trivia for you all: according to the parade hosts, Sonic was 
>the second largest (in terms of helium used) balloon in the parade 
>(Garfield was first), and Macy's parade is the second biggest user of 
>helium in the country (world?) - the US government is first.

Additional trivia...the entire stock of helium in the US is under control
of the US government.  This was done right after WWI, as airships (balloons
and dirigibles) had played such an important part in the previous skirmish.
In particular, Germany was denied access to all helium stores in the world.
Thus, to run their growing airship industry, Germany turned to hydrogen
gas, which could be manufactured very simply and in mass quantities.

Of course, the problem with hydrogen is that it is highly combustible...and
led to the destruction of the Hindenberg as it was landing in New Jersey.
While there are numerous rumors, the accepted trigger was a static electric
discharge that traveled along one of the many mooring ropes trailing from
the ship.  
 
Trivia item #2 - the helium used to inflate the common party balloon, as
you see from many restaurants and other stores, is not 100% pure helium.
It's my understanding that it's only about 70% helium, with other inert
gases.  And it's also a good reason not to breathe "balloon" helium.  Yes,
the helium is inert, and makes you sound funny...but you don't know what
those other gases in there could be.  I don't know about the Macy's Parade 
balloons, whether they use pure helium or the 'balloon' helium.

The deadly part is the fact that you are not inhaling oxygen. Once I 
heard about someone who put his mouth over a helium tank, with one of 
those balloon inflaters on top, turned it on, and took more that a full 
breath of helium. His face turned blue and he passed out on the floor. He 
recovered in about 10 minutes.

Yello,

Well, I have written a satirical story for all to see. It is probably riddled 
with more bad puns and spelling mistakes than I can be held responsible for.
I hope you enjoy it.

Oh by the way, it ends with Sonic getting killed by Robotnik, who via a matter 
translater changes to look like him and marries Sally. spolier. Naaah!
Geesh, that would be a socially unacceptable relationship crime. So read it and 
find out the story for yourself. Oh yeah one thing that is real though,
Thaddeus, I'm terribly sorry to break this to you, but you get robotocized,
and while I was at writing the story, I copyrighted your name. You will have
to pay me $500 everytime you use it.. or I will sue you! Aargghh! Sorry
guys, I feel over happy at the moment.. It has something to do with this
asci Graph!

David looked over the keyboard again, "DAMNIT! Where did that 'start' button
go to now?" He frantically felt over the keyboard again--it was a new type,
designed especially for Windoze 95C. The human looked underneath the table,
fortunately he was able to locate the piece of plastic. "Oh YES!"

He stuck the button back on the keyboard, "HAHAHA!", then after taking a
moments look--depressed it! But, the signal never reached the CPU, the PC's
internal DataBUS had in fact hung a long time ago--ever since he had loaded
the offensive data into memory.

"DOUGH!" Jamming the HARD-RESET button, he walked off to get some coffie
while the 80386-SX16 processor went about it's task of counting the 32Mb
memory he had on board--the memory he used as a Ramdrive to store all that
"Sonic Mature Material" he had collected up; after all with an MFM drive,
his ownly hope of viewing pictures that century was to load then into 300%
faster DRUM.

In the kitchen he took a moment to look outside, today was going to be a bad
day, already he could see the blue blurr..of a garbage sack, that the=
 municipal
services had neglected to take away, lying on his front yard. Through the
frosted up window it looked a little less deadly than it really was, but
he knew the fatal truth--soon the tiny bacteria cells in Earth's atmosphere
would begin acting--turning the garbage into a chemical hazard.

<ZOOOW!!> The sound of a laser blast threw David's body limpely up against
a cupboard.. But before he saw stars, he reeled around, "DAMNIT! WHY THE
BLUE BLAZING LASER TRAILING SUPER IONIZED FURR TOONIAC CHASING CARBON
ENTROPIED BADLY LISTING MASQUERADING PHREAKING VULPINE HELL CAN'T SBSET
PUT THE WINSTART VOLUME TO SOMETHING TOLERABLE???!!!???"

With that he passed out.

Water molecules in the gaseous phase hovered over the house, the movement
of the two clouds causing electrons to be ripped off--creating a surge of
static electricity. The blue shard of lightning found it's way down to a
pine tree, turning it into a crispy.

David awoke, something furry was exerting a downward pressure on him! He
futily tried to struggle free--but whatever it was, it had him pinned down
with seemingly robotic strength. David wished he could get a better look
at what it was--after all, watching the carpet up close was less than
exciting.

"Please, get off me!" he begged, "I can't breath, and.. uuh my allergies,
you're killing me!" There was a type of heavy breathing from above him,
almost a type of laughing, then his captor shifted it's weight forward,
causing him to wheeze.

The next minute David Pistone new, something wet and not entirely pleasant,
was brushing over his ear. "ARGGHHH!" In a moment of frantic struggle he
threw it off. "Stupid Bloody DOG!" He glared at his Maltese poodle, it
glared back--until he blinked.

Losing the confrontation he retreated to his computer room, nothing much had
actually happened since he had left. Windoze 3.11111 was still drawing
the Poorgram Manger menu. "DARN" he remarked, and restarted his task of
getting coffie.

Meanwhile inside the digital brain of his Cyruggs processor, little pieces
of silicon where beginning to do non-standard things. It seemed his A20
line had dropped from protected mode, and his Rom Basic was now installed.
Interrupt 21h, had been .. interrupted by the Creative Fabs, Sound Waster
on port 220h.. This had caused the SS and SI to be overshot.

David blew his stack,"DAMN IT! I NEED A REAL COMPUTER! ONE THAT DOESN'T=
 HANG!"
He found himself going for the RESET button again. This time however, the
machine violently defended it's state of laziness--when he pushed the
switch, the entire thing fell back into the casing.

"NOOO!" he violently threw the steaming cup of coffie against the monitor,
the .28 smashed, and the boiling caffeine laden liquid spewed all over the
cathode ray gun. The mixture buzzed, letting out electromagnetic waves
on all frequencies.

The human collapsed onto the floor, tears rolling down his face. "WHY? WHY?
JUST TAKE ME NOW!!! PLEAASE!"

And Zeus decided to humour him, throwing a lightning bolt out of the sky
down onto the electrical lines. The energy went surging through the CRT,
the coffie became vapour, the caffeine became a Uranium isotope, David
reached his half-life. <STEREOTYPE AND PUN>

For the next few moments all he was aware of was static and chaos, and a
whole series of cheap special effects. Oh, yeah, and Dave also did notice
that he was being thrown through a dimensional vortex, some word came to=7F
mind. "Nagus"

When he awoke he was standing in front of a crystal palace, he stared up at
it.. "Wow Dave, that sure is one high palace.. so powerfull.. I wonder what
they call it? The 'Palace of Power?'" He chuckled, then realising that he
was in an alternate reality.. he stopped.

Sitting down on the floor, he wondered to himself.
"    #Where am I?
     #Is this palace symbolic of something?
     #Does the palace have Internet?
     #Why am I seeing the Merio Brothers?"

Merio and Loo_ugly, stared at the strange human for a while, there was
something about him that posed a threat. Was it his face, No.. was it his
muscles.. NO WAY! It was the little Blue and White logo he wore on his
shirt, with the letters S*GA.

They hated S#GA, they much preffered Nintundo. Merio was the first to act,
"Hey, SAGA boy, we're gonna jump on your head!"
Dave froze, "Uhhuhuh, huu he he.. um well.."
Loo_ugly began too, "Yeah.. We're gonna make you mushy like lasagna!"
"Umm err well.. he he.. "
The two plumbers waved torque wrenches menacingly at him, while he=
 frantically
backed up until bumping into something behind him.

Captain-M, drew his gun, "Hey plumber-brothers, Get outta here!"
They did.
Dave faced his savior, "Thanks, you saved my life!"

Kalvin laughed, "Of course, I didn't want anybody breaking you, after all,
I want that honour !"
Again he made whimpering sounds.


() () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () ()=

Inside the palace, Mr Pistone hung harmlessly upside down, SiMan BelGoon,
Kid StickyGUS, VEGAMan, and Princess WhoknowsWhathernameis, made sarcastic
comments.

"Hey Kalvin, what if we put him through the time vortex?" Vegaman sneered.
"Naaah, uploading him via 2400 would be cool, but too expensive!"
"Well, what if we put him through the memory waster.."
"Naaaah, the ASAP might bust us, as our copy of DEFR_G is pirated.."
"Hmm.. What if we swap his brain with that of a hedgehog?"
"Yeah, that's Mega cool VEGA-man, but, we don't have any hedgehogs.."
"Darn, well, why don't you just shoot him?"
"Hmm.. that's a cool idea.."

He lifted his gun and aimed it at Dave's head, his eyes blinking with
determination. "NO!" The princess cried!
"What?"
"For God's Sake, not in the palace! Do you know how messy that will be?"
Vegaman smiled, "I'll clean it up princess!"

Just then David got up some courage, "Hey, I got such a cool plan! Why don't
you give me jet skates, and throw me into the void?"
The princess patted Kalvin on the shoulder, "Please Kalv, he would make
such a great crystal statue for the port'al room..."

Captain-M stopped, "Which room? The one with the port'al to Mobius?"
"Yes, the one on level three, room five, hall two!"
"You mean the one on l3,r5,h2, with Mobius on port'al three and landing
zone right in the middle of Knothole?"
"No the one on l3,r5,h2, with Mobius on three, landing zone-Knothole and
matter translation from Human to Vulpine .."
"Oh *that* one, hey, you're right, he would look cool there! But, he'd look
better the right way up!"

Dave shrugged his shoulders, a miraculous feat while hanging inverted.
"Uuuh, could I have one last request?"
"NO!" They screamed in union.
"But, I just wanted to see where I was going to be staying for the rest
of eternity... you know.. so I can stand right before I turn to crystal.."

SiMan BelGoon butted in, "he's right princess! Crystal Statues are the
absolute fad, but only if they stand the right way."
She looked at the pathetic human, "hmm... you're right.. I mean, it's
not like he's going to jump into a port'al and escape is it?"

-   -     -       -          -         -        -      -       -       -  -=

David stood in a peculiar way, SiMan complained. "No No No, You're doing it
all wrong.. Stand like you're a Knight.. No no.. not an Earth Knight, a
starwarrior Knight..."

"Uuhm, excuse me.. But is that port'al in jumping distance of me to Mobius?"
"No Ways! You couldn't possibly jump that far, you'd have to run and jump
into that port'al.."
"Oh.." The human built up some more courage, "Hey look there! It's Mutha
Drain!"
"Where?"

<RUN! JUMP! SHLLURRP!>

SiMan BelGoon stared at the Port'al, "You mindless dit'zes, you let him get
away!"
The princess yelled back, "Go get him.. SiMan!"
"No way! I look absoloutely dreadful with furr.."
"Just go, maybe in a thousand years we'll work out how to turn vulpines
back into humans..."
"No ways princess.. Besides-- there are .. not nice .. things there!"
"Captain-M.. you go!"
"No ways, I'm no good at fighting computers, that'll mean I'll lose.
And I get upset when I lose... it's not game-master like.."
"Kid StickGUS?"
"Okay Princess... NOT!"
"VEGA man?"
"I don't think so your, highness!"
"OH geesh, that's the problem with you men, you're all cowardly!"

They all stared at her, "YOU GO THEN!"
"No ways, I might break a finger nail!"

Notice from Simon: Some nice people from S#ga visited me (with=
 Pump-actions),
and persuaded me not to rip off Sonic and all his wonderful friends,
that is why their real names will be used here. Apparently, the story from
here on will be straight forward.
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- =3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- =3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- =3D-=3D-=3D-=
=3D-=3D- =3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- =3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- =3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-

David stood up, he felt kind of odd, warmish, furry.. he almost wanted to
hug himself.. uhhmm... maybe he could get someone to do it for him...later.

He took an observation of the proximity, lots of trees, and lots of trees,
he also noted that there were lots of trees around. "Aha" he told himself,
this was Knothole.. how extremely fascinillating.. there sure were a lot
of trees around.

The newly transformed fox walked a bit further, it seemed that he hadn't
popped up in the centre of Knothole--this posed a serious problem, as
there was no chance in whohaay that he'd simply find the place with the help
of some nice citizens directions.

"Okay, David Pistone, you are a cool confident collected individual, how
would you find Knothole.." He dropped to his knees to think.
"What you need to do is find Sonic, then everything will be cool..
But.. how do *I* find him?"

A dragon flew by overhead, almost not catching his attention. He dived up;
keeping his eyes on it; he ran as fast as he possibly could. "DULCY!"
She didn't notice, he ran faster. "DULCY!" Still no response, he pushed
himself to the maximum limit. "DULCY!! HEYYYY HEREE!"
Not looking at the floor he fell into a pool of water, the dragon flew
on without noticing him.

David choked bitterly as he climbed out of the crystal fluid, his only
hope now was that Knothole was near. He spun around to look at the pool
again--he could almost see Rotor, Sonic and Tails getting a power ring from
it.

Of course! This pool had to be the power ring pool! And if it was.. Knothole
was not very far off. But he knew one thing--he himself had once even said
it.. Knothole was so well hidden, you could get lost
just meters from the path.  Right now he had two choices--wait until Sonic
came to collect a power ring, or try his luck scouting for the village.

He decided on the former, sitting down on a fallen log, his mind began to
wonder... When he did eventually find the freedom fighters--what then?
What could he do for them? Why would they want an outsider like him?
What could he tell them? What if they didn't accept him?

There was a crackling from somewhere in the forest near him--someone or
something was coming. Instinctively he did a motion--that had he been
human, would have straightened his jacket.

The voices got louder, he could now make out Tails talking.
Soon they stopped in front of him, Sonic being the first to talk.
"Who are you?"
But only stunned whimpers could come from David, hot flushes went through
his body; he tried to loosen his collar--but found out he didn't have one.
He tried to take a deep breath, but instead all he could summon was a short
ventilation. "Uhhmm.. uuh.. Hi?"
The hedgehog stepping closer was badly percepted by the new-fox, as bad
body circulation resulted in image warbling.

He fainted.

**TICK TOCK TICK TOCK**

A middled aged raccoon spoke to Sonic, "He's fainted!"
"What?"
"I guess you surprised him, either that or he's another of your crazy=
 fans.."
Tails blinked.

David began groaning into awakeness; Sonic started, "You all right?"
Still lying on the floor and his voice limited came a soft reply, "..Yes.."
"What happened?"
"Um uhhrr.. I felt dizzy.." The fox blushed.
Bookshire began, "Who are you?"
David, now more online; turned his head to face the raccoon; looked at him
oddly--his eyes over-expanded; Sonic helped him up.
David on his feet immediately started to Bookshire, "Is your name=
 Bookshire..
Bookshire Draftwood?"
"You know me?"
"Oh yes.." Then turning to Tails, "and you are Miles.. Miles Prower.. but
you prefer to be called.. "
"Tails" the cub unioned.
Finally stopping his eyes on Sonic, "And you are Sonic.. Sonic the=
 Hedgehog?"
"That's me.. now who are you?"

"Oh," he began automatically, "I'm David Pistone... but most of my friends
call me Book.." He remembered the raccoon.
"Book?" asked the hedgehog curiously.
"Ahuum,.. BookKeeper.. but.. umm... you can call me.. David... yeah..=
 David."
"Oh, I don't know, I kinda like BookKeeper." Smirked the hedgehog.

They all grabbed him before he could fall again. "Uuh, thanks.. Sometimes
happens..must be the humidity and all.."
Bookshire looked oddly at him, "How did you get here?"
This was the part he'd dreaded, he just froze pathetically. Trying to think
of what to say.
If I tell them some lie, it might catch up to me. But will they really=
 believe
that I'm from Earth? What if I tell them I'm an escaped spy, with=
 information
on Robotniks plans? That could work, I'd be important then..

Bookshire's fingers waved by his eyes, "You Okay?"
"Uh yes.. Um.. Oh how I got here.. Well.. umm.."
Sonic butt in, "You lost?"
"Well.. kinda.. but I'll find my way just now.."
The raccoon stopped him, "I don't think you will!"
He almost choked, were they on to him? "uuhuhuh, why not?"
"There's no way, if you keeping fading out like that."

His sigh of relief was noted, again Bookshire inquired. "Are you all right?"
David lost his nerve, "Help me! I don't come from this planet!"
The three freedom fighters looked at one another oddly, "What!?!"
His voice steadily increasing in speed, "I come from the planet Earth, where
I'm a human, I came here through a port'al.. and it changed me to this!
I know all you because.." A cold sweat ran over him, "I can't tell you how..
but I just do.. I also know a lot of information about Robotnik.."

Again, reality began darkening, Sonic caught him out of his descent, however
this time a bit too late--the fox was out cold. Again.

David awoke with a prickling agony in his left arm, he quickly tried to sit=
=7F
up, but something metallic stopped him; It was Bunnie's arm, and Bookshire
had just injected him with something.
"Arr.. What in the blue-blazing null carrier DTR setting, pulse-width
modulating phreaking, digital realm's hell is that!?!"
Bookshire however stayed collected, "David, how do you feel?"
"uuh.. Okay I guess.."
"Now, why do you think you passed out?"
"uuuhmm... well.. you see.. umm.. just a bit too much excitement I guess.."
"I see.. now David.. What you told us before you.. fainted .. Is that true?"
The fox paused; the raccoon who understood this--motioned Bunnie to leave
them; then used a soft comforting voice.

"David.. It's allright you can tell me.."
"Okay.. well, I might was well tell you my life story. It began when I=
 was.."

                         **Really Boring Tick Tocks**

Somewhere else in the forest there was a type of corny-shlurping noise,
sounding like something out of a cheap monday afternoon cartoon with moral's
at the end. The cause of this was a human coming through the port'al,
instantly with a flash his body became a vulpine. A few seconds later,=
 another
body came through... this time a female..the vulpine converter seemed to=
 have
no difficulty coping with her either. (Unlike some things that error back to
DOS just because you save to an impossible file name.. <DEW 5.1>)
A few seconds later another body, then another, and then finally a robot.

They all stood around their leader, now a vulpea-vulpea (Red-fox), he lifted
a squarish box up--from it came beams of *really* bright light. The light
blinded all the boiwdies and beez for about two kilometers around, before
it finally died.

And when it did, it revealed, the M-Team--back in their original glory.
Kalvin was the first to speak, putting in a line that would excuse how they
got technology so quickly. "Wow! This is great, I'm so glad that=
 super-genius
came over.. hey princess?"
"Sure thing Kalvin, we were so lucky that he had the plans for one of these
reverse-o-matic-vulpea-human-human-vulpea-molecular-restructurers around!"
Vegaman butt in, in his normal croaking voice, "We were so lucky that the
duplomatic was compatible with his computer.. your highness."
The princess smiled, "Sure thing Vegaman, hey.. Kalvin, let's go.. It's
going to be night soon, and I really want a new pillow!"

** ** ** **

Back on Earth drops of coffie lost their state of high energy, the little
electrons dropping back to their standard orbit. It was then that something
amazing happened.. the data bus of the machine had a current induced into
it by an electromagnetic fluctuation brought on by cooling caffeine. This
surge caused the CPU to stop waiting on port 388h (Adlib); Windoze for
LurkGroups (almost) blazed back into life.

The screen began acting strange too, a layer of sugar had formed over the
hole in the glass, and all the air molecules had been teleported off to
Nintundo land. The result of this was that the screen began to regain it's
functionality.. the sugar acting as glass.. the caffeine acting as phosphor.
(believe me.. caffeine *Will* do that.. I mean MASA don't let astronauts
take coffie with them.. there has to be a reason!)

The 3.11 Logo came onto the screen, though it was not the standard one,=
 David
had long ago changed that when he found out he could save with WINGUF to=
 RLE.
The result of this.. a piccy of Sonic displayed on the screen, though it
was only in sixteen colour, but that didn't matter, as his display crOAK
display card only ran in 640X480X16 anyway.

** ** ** **

David stood firmly up as Princess Sally paced in an orbital around him,
Sonic, Bookshire and Rotor stood on the side--patiently waiting for some
outcome.
Sally continued, "Well, David do you have any special abilities?"
The fox's courage had increased now, "Yes.. I know a lot about the future,
and umm.. well oh yeah.. when I drink coffie I can go on.. working on the
computer all NIGHT!"
"So you're good with computers?"
He thought of his puny 386, "Yes, considering that I can get Sting Commander
three to run on my system.. I would say so.."

Sally's mind boggled, perhaps what they had was someone who could learn the
tricks from Bookshire, then execute them mid-mission. It was very tempting,
the possibility of being able to hack systems without either sneaking
the raccoon in, or risking the danger of being tracked when hacking by
remote; but she needed proof.
"Can you show us how fast you type?"
"Uuh. sure.."

Inside Rotor's hut he typed frantically at the keyboard, looking intensily
at it, Sonic, Sally and Bookshire made noises in awe, until finally he
stopped--out of breath.
The only problem David had, was while he could type fast, what he had typed
had merely been a load of crep, the new orientation of his fingers had been
a prime factor of this new language he'd invented.
"Oooow.. I miss my pinkie." he complained.

The hedgehog stared at him oddly, "What's a pinkie?"
"Well" he began informatively, "it's like another finger.."
Sonic lifted his gloved hand to his face oddly,=7F
"Another finger? That would be so.. so.. eeeeyyooww gross!.."

Rotor patted the fox on the shoulder,
"well, maybe after we give you some coffie?"
"Well, you shouldn't count on caffeine to make stuff grow, or enlarge."
"No, I mean.. your typing.."
"Oh yeah, almost forgot.. Okay.. let's do that then.."

The walrus collected a tin from the back, it was unusually light, and he=
 soon
found out why. It was empty. He looked around for some more, but found that
he was all out of instant coffie. "Oh well" he sighed, "Guess I'll just
have to give him *percolated* coffie.."
He took some choice selected coffie beans, stuffed them in the grounder,
squeezed them till near fusion, then started up the machine. (It was petrol
operated.. and had a lawnmower engine, maximum power for extracting the
maximum caffeine content.)

"Here you go" he smiled, passing the fox the steaming mug;David quaffed it.
In a moment the chemical took effect on his body--there was a deep rumbling
that shook the ground; a slight spasmatic attack that propelled the mug
into the wall.. and then finally.. David let out a soft burp.

The freedom fighters sighed in relief;the fox sat down, typing slightly=
 slow,
but his spelling and grammatic ablities incredibly boosted.
Sonic whined, "NOOOO!"
Sally stopped him, then continued on to the former human, "Uhhm David,
maybe there's something else you can do?"
Again the impatient hedgehog butt in, "hey.. what about him for lookout...
after all.. it's not like he's ever going to sleep again.. not this decade!"
David rotated his head, "hey, that's a cool idea... when do I start?"
Sally looked at the hedgehog queerly, waiting for some comment.
Sonic offered it, "what about now.. let's go!"

With that David slowly climbed out of his chair; walked even slower to the
door; watched Sonic zip out, and then.. zipped out next to him, pulling a
mean speed of 660M/s. His HIKE_AIRS just weren't prepared for these vectors,
they burst into flames sending him jumping around at mach-2 in agony.
It was then that Sally saw for the first time in her
life the extreme potence of high octane carbonized beans.

Sonic stopped him, "Whoa.. Dave! That's amazing.. I wonder how long it will
last for?"
"Caffeine highs can last between three to eight hours!"
"Wow! That's amazing!" Then facing back to Sally--who had come running to
them when they stopped, he began, "hey Sal.. whatdya think? The guy's=
 great!"

** ** ** **  <Wow! these ** patterns would be compressed with LZW!>

Robotnik slammed buttons on the panels violentely, "SNIVELY TELL ME.. WHY IS
IT THAT THE HEDGEHOG ALWAYS *WINS*?"
The subservient stepped forward,
"w..w.ww well sir.. I think it might have something to do with the=
 terminals."
"The terminals?"
"Sir, while you designed them brilliantly two years ago.. technology does
change.. you see sir 2400 modems.. just aren't fast enough anymore."
"Strange.. 2400 Gigabits a second seems more than sufficient to me."
"Well um sir.. you see.. it seems a group of freedom fighters are using
a new type of their own.. and.. it's <GULP> uuhmm bette.. has a higher
transfer rate.."
"Yes.. tell me more."
"Well sir.. they seem to have error correction too, it's called V34ditz, and
um, well sir.. they also have compression.. it's called MNOP5.. and sir..
their baud rate.. is well <FRANTIC LAUGHS> 9600."
"WHAT?!? I don't want to be the only one in the neighbourhood who has to
wait while I download! I hope for your sake you've done something!"

The human stepped forward proudly, "Yes sir.. my system runs at 14.4Gbs..
I call it the US robotnik!"  [NANANA CORNY!]
"Brilliant Snively! I'm glad I thought of it, but the question is.. will it
be able to connect to existing terminals?"
"Of course, the US robotnik is fully downward compatible!" [WISH THEY WERE]
"But Snively, will it be easy to install and configure?"
"Of course, it's the half card internal solution! And thanks to the Ess
registers.. it's easy to configure!"   [IF U LIKE SCANNING BOOKS AT 2:00AM]
"But what if I don't have a technical guide handy when I need to setup one?"
"Oh sir! That's what the Sportstar is for, it automatically configures=
 itself,
and can save setting to an onboard EPROM!" [Prob:Settings always booga up]

"Ha ha Snively, sometimes my genius astounds me! Now.. call dispatch and
send me up a prisoner.. I feel good!"
"Uhuhuh" frantically laughed the human, "sir.. we haven't had prisoners in
weeks.."
"What!?! Call Packbell, he'll get us some." then in a softer type of
whimpering, "Packbell always does.."

The android was caught unaware when the screen flicked to him, at the time
he was monitoring inter-dimensional waves. He reeled around angrily,
"AAAR, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU.. oh, Hello.."
Robotnik grinned, "Packbell my boy, we seem to have run out of..=
 disposables."
"Well, send Snively to get some, there's a village marked on my notepad."
"What?!? You haven't got them yet?"
"No.. I've been too busy studying jump traces.. it seems that four humanoids
and one robot have entered our world..."
"Humans! Packbell--get them! I haven't tortured humans since..." he stared=
 at
Snively who began backing off "... since.. yesterday!"
The android acknowledged.
From inside the control centre, the overlords nephew's head hitting the wall
like a ping-pong ball caused the entire structure to resonate.

** ** ** **

"How much further SiMan?" whined the Princess.
"Oh, not much your highness, SiMan Belgoon never gets lost!"
"That's notacus!" complained StickyGUS, "are you forgetting about the
timicus in Clutsovania?"
"Oh that?" he laughed, "I was just a little bit confused.."
"Simanius.. we had to begicus directions..."

<CRACK!>

The princess mottioned them to keep quite, "Quite guys, somebodies coming!"
"SiMan Belgoon is a master of invisibility.."
"Sure, now just keep quite!"
"I can blend right into the background.."
"Great just *keep* quite!"

The group members each hid behind a tree.

** ** ** **

Tails walked unknowingly on, Sally following some distance behind him, using
the excuse she always did to keep an eye out on him--that she needed a walk.
As the cub turned past one of the trees, there was a muffled whimpering=
 sound,
and he dissapeared. Sally ran towards the spot, and in an instant was
facing SiMan Belgoon--his whip wrapped around her waist.

"Aaah, how nice of you to join us.." he boasted.
"Who are you?!?"
"SiMan Belgoon.." he bowed, "..at your service!"=7F
Kalvin felt a bit left out so he also added an advert, "..of the M-team!"

SiMan, yanked his whip, causing Sally to unwind in the lamo style like in
cheap cartoons. She landed on the ground, looking up at Captain-M; Who was
holding Tails.

He dropped the fox cub next to her, and then the human princess took over.
She walked to Kalvin, who had his gun trained on the furries, and pointed
at Tails. "Kalvin, he'll do just perfect! Look at that warm cuddly fur!"
SiMan took a large skinning-knife out of his (seemingly) bottomless=
 backpack.

Sally cuddled Tails, warding them off, "Leave him alone! He's only a cub!"
"What?!?" asked the other princess.
SiMan wasted no time in pulling out a dictionary and stealing the moment,
"A cub--young member of a series of species groups, including bears, wolves
foxes, lions.. and also a shortened word used to describe an aircraft.."
She patted him on the stomach, "I know that, but what I want to know.."
turning to Tails, "are there any adults of your kind?"

The two freedom fighters were shocked, so SiMan had to put an answer in
instead, "..of course there are.. they obviously come from a primitive
village."
Kalvin finished by picking up the fox and pointing his gun at him, "and you,
are going to take us there? Right?"
Sally shuddered in silent fear.

** ** ** ** **

When they came into the village, chaos began to assert itself. The human
princess beginning the pillow selection process.
She looked at Antoine, nope not cuddly enough.
She looked at Jason, nope his skin had too many injuries on it.
As she headed towards David, Sonic abruptly butt in.

"Hey, just a Sonic sec, what's going on here?"
Captain-M looked at him, and smiled.
"Hey princess, do you mind if we bring him back with us?"
"Okay Kalvin, but you know the rule with pets.."
It was then that SiMan remembered the SAGA fan who had been turned into a=
 fox,
he whispered something into Kalvin's ear.

Kalvin then picked up Sally like a wet tea-towel, holding his blaster to her
head, "Okay, there's someone here who joined you a while ago.. who?"
Sally stared into David's eyes, "I won't tell you!"
She was a matyr or whatever they were called, Dave thought to himself, a few
moments later he found out she wasn't the only one--as he admitted that he
was the one.

With that, the M-Team selected their souvenirs, the princess took well, the
princess. The game-master took the faster-game-master. Vega man, took the
Mega-walrus. Kid StickyGUS, though that Tails would do nicely for archery.=
=7F
SiMan Belgoon really wanted to take the CyberBunny, but ended up taking
David for the human princess instead.

"Okay!" Smiled Kalvin, as the ropes were looped around their captives,=
 "let's
get back to the telezone!"
And that they did, trampling through the bushes.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

Simon Howes typed deperately at home on his computer, it seemed for some
reason that his mind was losing it's normal ability to generate fractal
stories. He loaded another personality--ten minutes later he began to peel
himself of the ceiling with a spatula.

He then went onto his favourite BBS, hoping to kill some time, the result,=
 he
got Chromatiks II diskmag. Yay, now he had the ability to play. BTM.S3M,
"behind that mask".. well.. now Simon was depressed even more.

He dialed the BBS, and it wasn't engaged. "YES!" he smiled, as he shaked a
clenched fist, but uncle Murphy laughed, for the BBS just kept on ringing.
Perhaps Rebecca was scared her little computer would get hurt by the=
 lightning
from the storm that was now sweeping over the city.

Simon looked at the clock above his monitor 11:59, the room seemed to have
a frightening ambience--the storm had a hole in it.. just for him--just
large enough to brighten his house so that the screen could get a horrid
reflection on.

The song, played a flute, a sadish flute.. Well.. well.. that is the thread
of destiny. And Simon continued to define the alternate realm.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

Walking through the misty forest, Kalvin was one of the first to notice the
movement ahead. In the diffused light, something pranced about.
A few seconds later it had vanished, Sonic's comments didn't.
"Swat-bot! Get outta here!"

SiMan laughed, "Please Hedgehog, the M-team fears nothing!"
"It's going to contact more of them!"
"Oh, shut up!"
"Trust me, it will!"
With that the human got some sticky tape out of his backpack and gagged him.

The walked for about half an hour more, until finally the jump-zone was in
sight.

It was then that Kalvin saw the army of robots assembled to attack him!
He drew his pistol, searching for a target. He found one, a humanoid.
Packbell laughed, "Please, put that down.." The swat-bots armed their=
 weapons,
and the android spoke again, this time slowly putting emphasis on every
syllable. "There.. is .. no .. way .. you .. can .. escape.. "

The game-master smiled, "Sorry!"
He pulled the trigger, a corny 2-operator-FM-sound emmanated from the=
 pistol,
and.. that was all.  He made a softish laughing sound, as the teams of=
 Robots
jumped down amongst his team and captives, tying one captive to one=
 M-member.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

Back at Robotropolis, they sat waiting their fate. They were in a large=
 metal
room with a stage about 2 meters high. Robotnik stood gloating on it, making
comments on how they were going to be robotocized. After ten minutes, he
left them alone as he went to prepare the robotocizer for their arrival.

Sonic moved his splines a bit, trying to make it as uncomfortable as=
 possible
for Kalvin who was tied to his back. The human, in turn responded with an
insulting comment.
The human princess began next, "VegaMan, help! I don't want to.."
He croaked, "Sorry your highness, I can't get free..."
"Well, it's not like you've got anything to lose.. you're a robot!"
They began arguing, David moaned... this was not the way he wanted to end
his organic functioning.
"STOP IT!" he commanded, "We're all in trouble, we're all going to get
robotocized, and all you can do is fight!"
The quieted.
He continued, "For goodness sake, we're all similar. Look, we got two hero's
tied back to back, each one taking on a mega-techno-enemy. Two-princess's,
who have had their fathers sent into a void where mirrors and crystals seem
to have odd properties. Two mega techno-strong dudes, two fly guys.. hey..
and we've got two mindless morons who mumble on."
He felt slightly honoured that he was being compared to the blithering idiot
he was tied to--SiMan Belgoon.

"Now, are we going to work together?"
It was a stupid question, of course they were.. whether they liked one
another or not--they liked the idea of being a slave less than bad company.

After a good deal of struggling, which involved them making a human.. well..
person pyramid, to position Tails so he could rampage through
SiMan's backpack--looking for a knife or something sharp to cut them free,
they were quite humoured.
1 live chicken, a watermellon, inflatable bike, coin press, acme anvil,
and finally an electric bread cutter.

The group that was all supporting StickyGUS and Tails sighed in relief, as
they cut the rope around SiMan and David. SiMan fell back, David too,
something flew out of Belgoon's backpack... a shiny toroid..

"MmmPPWWER MRRINGG!" Sonic tried to spit out through the gag he still had=
 on,
Sally after getting free removed it. A few minutes later they were all free.
Sonic picked up the Power-Ring, "Hey Si? Wheredya get this?"
"Oh that, I found it in this pond.."
"Way cool, let's cruise."

"Wait!" butt in the human princess,
"we need the matter-translater--it's the only way we can get home again."
"Robotnik!" commented Sally.
The hedgehog looked worriedly, "Okay.. I'll get it!"
Captain-M looked oddly, "Hey, we still have to get out of here!"

David gave his strategic mind to them, "What if we break into two teams,
collect a laser for you.." he motioned Kalvin, "get some percolated for=
 me.."
"And.." he motioned Sonic, "get the translator.."

They all agreed that the teams would be mixtures of M and Freedom Fighters,
that way neither side would have to worry about any (Brutus) backstabbing.

The teams were as follows:

A-Team: Sonic ,  Princess of Prowler , Tails    , Vegaman, David.
B-Team: Kalvin,  Princess Sally      , StickiGUS, Rotor  , SiMan.

It was decided that the A-team would collect the matter translator and
the high octane fuel, while the B-team would get a laser-rifle or two, and
clear a way out of the base--while providing a distraction for the A-team.
There were two doors in the room, each team took a door, not knowing whether
they would see their friends in the other team again.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

A lone swat-bot was most abruptly suprised as a whip wrapped itself around=
 it,
however, though it was "shocked", the whip did little more than leave an
unpleasant smell on it's 15Cm of titanium armour.
"Ohh dear", remarked SiMan as it trampled towards him. Kalvin looked at the
metallic beast, hah, too easy, too easy, he was a gamemaster. He smiled,
placing one finger on the gamepad on his belt. "Hey.. ugly over here!"
The robot turned to face him as he jammed the button, once again another
cruddy FM sound was heard and no physical effect or magical graphics were
seen.

Kalvin backed up towards a wall, bumping his spine into a pipe. The robot
came closer, and closer, giving him a real idea of what it felt like to be
freedom fighter--shit scary. Suddenly the robot stopped, the whip still
attached around it's waste, and it's 'arms' still pinned to it's side, it
dropped like a christmas beetle to the ground. Sally smiled, holding the
smoking rifle... the same rifle it dropped when it had been hit by the whip.

                               ** ** ** ** **
A thousand billion light years away under the solar warmth that sometimes
dared to penetrate the clouds that hung over the little piece of land
jutting out of the blue water, past the trees and the wrecked buildings,
over forests, and over destroyed dreams. Thaddeus Body screamed, of all=
 things
that patch of Ablaters.. that Sonic patch.. that .. that.. oh.. Sonic and
Tails had beaten him again, making his Doom nightmares even worse, hey he
used to feel tough, strong and macho when he had a shotgun. But thanks to
the power of DEHACKED, the hedgehog could run a circle around him in the
time he took between shots. "I hate that hedgehog" he muttered, his brother
laughing in the background "Crappy Sonic.. Crappy Sonic."

It was about then that he decided he needed a drink of nice cool refreshing
orange juice, though, seeing it was winter.. imitation Noros would have to
do instead. He stood up, and noticed the strain on his legs once more, damn,
doom always did that to him, ammong other things he was shivering. The
standard effects of forgetting to eat while playing computer games. He
walked through into the kitchen to see someone had left the cold water
bottle out of the fridge. Damn, it was standard practice for his younger
brother to abandon the thing when it was out of water. "DAMNIT.. IF SOME
PEOPLE WOULD REFILL THE WATER AROUND HERE!"

He opened the fridge, at least the 30 milli-litres of Noros would be cold,=
 he
poured the horrid fluid into a cup, poured some warm water from the tap
into his cup and reeled at it. "Oh.. need icecubes."
He opened the freezer to see an odd looking icecube, unlike the others
it was glowing green.. strange he thought to himself as he picked it up,
maybe his brother had been freezing Jello again. Geesh, of all things, he
hated it when the little runt started shoving stuff in the freezer, it
seemed to be a metal disorder induced by watching too much "Toiwminator II."

However when he pulled the green cube out, he began to consider the fatal
possibility that it wasn't a standard drink coolant, nor a frozen dessert
ingredient. The stone glowed wierdly, emmanating a sort of light. He looked
around, nobody was watching him, so he slipped it into his pocket and
retreated to the safety of his "den."

Inside he placed it on the table and examined it, it was perfectly square,
on the left side there were three buttons, marked: "BITEND,BYTEEND,HIGH."
Making no logic of it he began to ponder how it would do at cooling his
drink, suddenly a fizzle of light appeared above it. Sparking in golden
aura's of mystery. Out of it formed an image.. it was a human, wearing a
SEGA shirt.

The hologram spoke, "Thad, I don't have much time to explain,  I think=
 they're
billing my account, and Mobius is DAMNED far. But well.. because the
communications service is so good here, you are getting this message before
I actually send it. Now listen well, press all three of the buttons on
this thing, it will teleport you to Mobius. When you arrive, remember,
you have to stop Sonic from using his power ring.. otherwise we are all
going to be soup."
The image began to fade away, leaving Thad very, very, very.. confused.

** ** ** ** ** **
Something ran over the cruddy monitors display before the human could figure
out exactly what it was. He managed to look up in time to see a graph
whizz by, whatever it was.. it meant danger.

Bill knew that this would oneday come, and now he had no choice, he
would have to go out in combat.. like a programmer. He was born a programmer
and he would die one. And the will that inspired him was simple--an insult,
someone had dared to crash Windoze 95 (Mobian Release)!
Something he couldn't tolerate... no it was simply unacceptable.. and=
 whoever
was to blame would pay dearly.
Uncle Gates, slapped his MacroSlop jacket on, donned his GLOCK and pumper,
copied tetris-pro onto a CD and headed for the port'al room.

He passed armed imperial macroslop guards as he went, they saluted him--he
was more of a coder then they. At the centre of the wall stood the glowing
cyan spawner. It was shaped like a window, with four coloured squares=
 instead
of glass, each of these squares took the user to another direction. And if,
the user became stuck at any time, he could simply pull down the easy to
read online help.
Someone stood behind the teleport control machine, saluting he threw the
switch, turning the coloured port'als into windows, each one seeing out into
another kingdom. He pranced through the hole and appeared in Mobius.

As he touched the floor he though to himself how odd it was, last time he=
 had
been here, that was when that Acorn chap ruled, things were so much=
 different.
The street where he stood was more grassy, less tarry, and the sky was a
good deal more blue. "Well Acorn" he thought to himself, "it's an=
 interesting
change." He still remembered the king, perhaps he would stop by and get some
coffie, after all they were good friends. Macroslop had coded Mobius's
most succesful auto city defence software.

<SWAT-BOT DETECTED! GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT>

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

Thad ran through Robotropolis, a series of SWAT-bots following him. In the
excitement he had forgot to bring any sort of weapon, though he did have
an umbrella.. but then again 10CM of stainless steel armour usually didn't
get pierced by atmosphere manipulator systems. A laser crashed down behind
him, causing him to feel a surge of power like no other, he was now
running at a rate he never would have believed possible. The thought crossed
his mind about SWAT-bot's as athletic coaches.. but he wasn't about to ask
one.

In the distance stood a man in a "I love Windoze" jacket, he seemed to
be oblivious to the oncoming danger. Thad screamed with all his might,
"HEY GPF, LOOK OUT!"
Bill rotated his body, shotgun drawn. Shortly Thad after noticing it was
pointing at him, stopped, the robots gaining in the distance.
"Hey.. I'm on your side.. just lookout for those.. SWAT-BOTS!!"

A lone robot stood in front of them, Thad cowered behind the shotgun holder.
The machine spoke, "HALT FREEDOM FIGHTER YOU ARE UNDER ARREST!"
Bill twisted his face to the side, "Help."
The machine stood there, almost curious to his command.
The human's eyes suddenly glowed red with anger,
"WHAT! NO ONLINE HELP! DAMN YOU.. YOU DAMNED OasiS/2 USER! DIE DIE!"
He reeled shot after shot at the machine.

** A bruising half an hour later **

Stainless steel armour was stronger than lead, the two realised as Robotnik
grinned at them through the glass. They were in separate robotocizers, the
cylinders already lowered. Julian laughed, evily, "Tell me.. Mr Gates.. you
know I always have wanted to ask this question.. what happens if you defrag
while you are in Windoze 3.1111?"
"Oh.. only a moron would do something like.."
The man in red's facial expression showed who the Moron had been.
Bill quivered, "of course, I mean.. that is a little bug.. really isn't it?"
"Yes.. indeed it is.. indeed it is.. now tell me dear young Todd.. or
whatever your name was.. have you ever played Doom?"=7F
He tried to suck up, "Yeah.. and I got this way cool Sonic patch, from
Simon Howes in South Africa.. IT'S ALL HIS FAULT! And..well you shoot Sonic
and Tails.. like a lot.."
"Simon can wait till later, besides I can't teleport him here as his
AND-DX40 interferes with the teleporter. Now.. about this doom, were you
ever amazed by the texture mapping? Did you enjoy the thrill of shooting,
killing, and racing around virtual complexes? Did you ever think it was the
best program you ever saw?"
"YES! YES! YES!"

Bill in the other chamber lifted his glasses slightly, "honestly, such
incompatible DOS4Gee_W programs, I just don't see how you can enjoy them.."
"SHUT UP!" unisoned the two.
"Now" put in Robotnik, "won't you be happy to see IP's Quack?"
"YES!"
"Good, well.. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO!" he burst into uncontrolled laughter,
nearly falling over at times. "GOODBYE!"

He clicked the button in and walked out of the room, the SWAT-Bots could
take care of the rest. Besides, he had better things to do.. like play
Epit's ZZZT.

As the robotocizer began powering up, Thad looked over to Bill.
"You damned moron, this is all your fault! WINDOZE CO-ORD!"
A yellow beam came down over him, then Bill, he knew he was doomed, as was
Sonic, for nothing could stop him using the Power-Ring now.

Something happened, as the robotocizer scanned Gates, it detected the silver
CD in his pocket, it frantically read it, and uploaded it to the system for
study. The machine stopped, still in scan phase, and the glass shrouds
lifted, letting the still organic beings out. Thad saw the message
"Unable to find vbrun300.dll" on the one display.
Bill mumbled a comment about sloppy harddrive management.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
As Sonic dived at a SWAT-bot in his full rotational fury, it suddenly=
 dropped
out it's way. He ended up half a second later on the floor, spitting out
pieces of cement. As for the SWAT-bot.. it was strangely offline. The team
walked on, finding every single robot in the entire structure .. powerless.
It was easy to get the matter-translater, Robotnik was far to busy slamming
the keyboard in anger to notice the hedgehog creep in.

David got his cup of coffie with great ease too, though now there was=
 nothing
to try it out on. The team met safely at the main gate. Sonic embraced=
 Sally,
but suddenly stopped. "Sal.. do *you* hear that?"
She pricked her ears up, in the far off distance she could hear something,
a type of crackling.. no a type of.. CHEERING! Robotocized citizens=
 everywhere
had broken their bonds, and were trashing the factories in which they=
 worked.
"Hey, Sal.. wait here.. I'm gonna check it out."

Thaddeus dived into vision, pulling the power-ring out of Sonic's hand=
 before
he could use it. The resulting forces however threw the human face down onto
the floor. Sonic walked over to the stunned figure, "hey buddy, what's the
problem?"
"No.. no.. power-ring.. no power-ring.. don't use it.. was warned by time
transport.. don't use this ring.."
His tired body lapsed into sleep.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

He awoke three weeks later, though when he looked up, he saw the strangest
thing. Above him was a wooden ceiling, a beautiful wooden ceiling. Around=
 him
stood Sonic and Sally, as well as someone wearing a crown. He smiled at the
human, "Thankyou boy.. for your courage has saved us all."
"Whe.. where am I? Who.. who.. are you?"
"You.. are in the second royal palace, and I am the King, King Acorn."
His eyes grew large in amazement, "I though the palace was destroyed.."
"It was.. but you don't get to my age by being stupid, I always considered
I might need a second concealed castle, just in case the wife started began
on of those.. most embarassing divorce suits.."
Thad stood up to stare out the window, outside the free mobians, who by
the looks of it were derobotocized, were beginning the hard task of
rebuilding their garden city. They were succeeding too. "How?"
David stepped over to him, laughing, "when windoze hangs, it takes the
whole network with it. Robotnik even had his power stations running of
the Gateway, when that crashed, he couldn't even reboot."
"Where is Bill now?"
"Oh.. well after he.. err.. expressed his irritation, with a GLOCK to
Robotnik,  he went back to Earth. It seems that he was rather ticked that
Ivo errored out Windoze 95."
"How?"
"He shelled to MS-DOG to run ZZZT."
"So.. " he smiled, "it was his own passion for adventure that destroyed=
 him."

The king smiled, "Indeed it was, and it has cost him dearly.. but that no
longer matters friends, for now is a time for a grand feast."

###

And so our story ended, with the M-team pushing off with their matter
translator, David decided to stay on Mobius, rather than risk having to get
a.. [fox/dog?] license for himself from the SPCA. Thaddeus however, decided
that though the world he was born on sucked, it was his destiny. And now the
forces of evil had been banished here.. he could return home and sleep
peacefully, knowing the onslaught was over, and that never again, forces
of such evil would tear a planet.

Of course, Bill was hailed a Mobian hero, they named a day after him, a day
where everybody painted their windows in different colours. It was called
the day of the write-back-cache.

Back on Earth the human genius rolled in his earnings from the Macroslop
products, but something he detected was wrong.. every day, there were more
OasiS/2 users. Every day.. someone would write him into a satire. The humans
couldn't accept their fate, he looked over a machine he had acquired, that
now rested in his television room. He stroked the glass cylinder smoothly,
and spoke softly to himself, "The users, will just have to be made more
efficient.. won't they Bill."

                          And that is what he did.

                                   The End.

Subject: Still more on sucking helium...

Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

Again deleting my source's name to protect him :^)  The only comment I'll 
make is that I'm somewhat surprised that it's economical to get helium from 
whatever's floating around the atmosphere; I seem to remember deep sea oil 
wells being a major source, or am I confusing that with a Tom Swift story I 
read years ago?  :^)

Whoops, one other comment: isn't nitrogen "inert" as far as lungs are 
concerned?  (or most other things; doesn't it take lightning to make 
nitrogen combine with oxygen?)

RDB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>The only comment I'll make is that as long as these "other inert gases" 
>aren't things like chlorine, carbon monoxide, or hydrogen sulfide (none of 
>which are really inert :^)), then I don't know what would be dangerous 
>about inhaling party helium (but don't sue me if you do and it kills you :^))

Inert - heheh, poor choice of word on my part.  :) Typically, the majority
of the other gas is nitrogen...same as regular air.  But the primary
process of extracting helium is through freezing air until liquified
then extracting the gases as they "evaporate" from the liquid.  But
other gases can also be frozen along with the helium...it's a matter
of what was in the area at the time.  Granted, they should be filtered off, 
but if it's not going to be used for medical applications (primarily decom-
pression chambers for deep sea divers), they don't always use enough
care during the process.  Cyanogen (cyanide) gas, anyone?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
And another reply from the same source:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>The deadly part is the fact that you are not inhaling oxygen. Once I 
>heard about someone who put his mouth over a helium tank, with one of 
>those balloon inflaters on top, turned it on, and took more that a full

Not to mention that human lungs were never meant to be "inflated" that
way, and could cause an embolism or rupture of the lung.  A balloon
doesn't have enough pressure to do that, since most human lungs can
inflate a balloon. Direct from the tank??  *SHUDDER*

But he'd have to be sucking a lot of helium to get that effect.  The human
body can go for 3+ minutes without oxygen...and that's a lot of helium
breathing.

Of course, Sonic's face is _already_ blue.  So, in one episode where he is
deprived of oxygen (his old friend Hodge-Podge gives him a bear (hare?) hug),
guess what happens?  Sonic's face turns _red_ instead.

Not to introduce too much levity into what is a deadly serious topic, but I
just thought I'd mention this.

Greetings:

All I know is that Archie Comics honors subscriptions in the US and
Canada -- I've had to enter a subscription in my own name and ship the
issues to a Mobian sympathizer in Mexico.  

As for S. Africa --  if Archie doesn't have a rep in the country, it
would cost way more than the US$15 subscription price just to mail
issues to you so that they get there in a timely fashion (at the library
where I work, I'm in charge of forwarding periodicals to a college
library in Nigeria so this is not outside my realm of experience).

I'm wondering if the Fleetway comix get to you down there.

It's a work in progress of mine.  Working title: "Mobius Apocalypse."
Before the final resolution a horrible fate will befall Bunnie, there
will be major destruction of Mobius, some not-exactly gratuitous sex and
serious violence.  The fate of the world will rest on one character
whose death is a given.  This ain't no foolin' around!

Oh course. Balloons promote feelings of joy, good cheer, and freedom from 
things (like gravity). On a similar subject, for those of you who 
remember Exo-Squad, in the post-episode profile of JT Marsh, it says he 
always dreams about flying. But not exactly flying just to fly, flying to 
be free.

I am just glad there wasn't a Tails balloon involved in this fiasco.

Tails #2 [Jan, 1996]
"Southern Crossover, Part 2"
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     Anyone out there care to tell me how Tails could resume work
on his "Tails To Astonish" preadolescent fantasy/comic book when
the first installment was deep-sixed along with the Sea Fox in
Part 1?  You know that it's going to be a bumpy ride when you hit
a continuity error this early on.
     Fluke approaches Downunda, and Tails flies off on his own,
little realizing that he's been picked up on Crocbot's radar.  As
a result, he runs into a welcoming committee of a pack of wing
dingoes.  After dodging a couple of them, Tails gets one of his
tails severely chomped and he crash-lands.  Before the wing
dingoes can finish him off, however, the Downunda Freedom
Fighters come to his rescue and drive off the pack.  The DFF
consists of: Guru Emu, a Sixties throwback; Wombat Stu (who for
some reason is lemon yellow); Duck "Bill", an alleged platypus
who has the unfortunate luck of being drawn by Manak; Walt
Wallabee, a kangaroo who's the leader of the group; and Barby
Koala.  My dictionary defines a "koala" as a "sluggish, tailless,
gray, furry arboreal marsupial" with the characteristic large
nose used for sniffing out eucalyptus oil.  Barby, of course, is
white instead of gray, has an hourglass figure, and her nose is
one of those cute little numbers that can fit inside a bottlecap.
Somebody PLEASE give Manak a subscription to National Geographic
for Christmas!
     But back to the plot.  One of the wing dingoes circles back
and kidnaps Wombat Stu.  This saves Crocbot's hide, since he
doesn't want to report that the pack was defeated by the DFF,
thereby causing Robotnik to cancel delivery of his bots and
supplies.  By displaying the captive Stu, Crocbot convinces
Robotnik that he's got the situation under control, so Robotnik
prepares to unload the blimp.  The DFF, however, decide to rescue
Stu rather than stop the blimp, so they take off for Crocbot's
headquarters (shaped like the Sydney Opera House).
     And what about Tails?  Walt dropped him off inside a crater
[major points to Gallagher for not taking him to an Ayers Rock
knockoff, which would have registered at 10 on the cliche meter].
He awakes to discover that not only is one of his tails out of
commission, he also has a sprained ankle and a broken arm.  As
banged up as he is, however, he follows the sound of a voice into
a cave.  There, in a totally gratuitous turn of the plot, he
encounters statues of the Ancient Walkers and is told that they
are his "forebearers" [the actual term is "forebears", Mike, but
never mind].  He receives this news from Athair, an echidna who
looks like Knuckles except that he's brown, he wears rasta beads
in his dreads, and has a forehead that makes him look like he's
part Klingon.  Nice shower clogs, though.  He speaks of his blood
flowing through Knuckles' veins, inquires if Tails is "the Chosen
One," and tells Tails "you are mine...body and soul."  Tails is
terrified and the reader is totally confused.  To be continued.
     de-Tails: a reply to one letter teases with a line about
stories concerning Tails' family and origins, along with upcoming
Bunnie stories in future Sonic issues.

Hi, Daniel:

English-language copies of many of our comics actually do make it into South
Africa and onto store shelves, however there is no subscription service as of
yet.  That may change in the future, however.  You'd be surprised at just
where our English-language comics end up, in fact.  In addition to South
Africa, many turn up in India, Australia and of course, England.  Just
thought that tidbit would interest you...

Best regards,

Do you know how your comics get to those countries?  Are there 
distributors that new, international list subscribers can be referred 
to?  This information would be a valauble addition to the FAQ's as well 
as the Merchandise List.

Hi Erich:

I could give you the name of the distributor, however that probably won't do
any good as the distributor sells direct to retail stores, and there is no
way for me to find out exactly which retail stores they sell to...

Sounds like you were a little confused by the "Doomsday" ep.  You've got
company: the jump-cutting during the finale didn't help matters at all.

As to how Sally got that way, you have to go back to the "Drood Henge"
ep.  In that case, the plot revolved around something called the Deep
Power Stones.  Joined in one configuration they were supposed to be a
source of limitless power; joined in another configuration they were
able to destroy...I don't know...the whole planet?  

I humbly suggest you check the FAQ File, which summarizes the episodes
in roughly the order in which they were first aired.

Well, I finally got over that case of writer's block, and figured out the
middle of my story.  This story will complete this arc, and will figure
into all of my future stories.  I won't spoil it by telling you any more

Timeline: That next morning.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Daybreak over Knothole was its usual glorious self, if not somewhat busier
than usual.  The multitude of rescued Mobitropolis refugees were basically
wandering around, trying to learn their new routines.  Order was something
that could be achieved later, and confusion shortly became the rule.

It had started, of course, with Sally's usual speech about what had
happened in the last 10 years, about how Way Past Cool the Freedom Fighters
were, etc etc.  The usual propaganda, Joseph mused, as he watched the
various parts of Knothole from deep within his control room, yet inspiring
in a way...

He went back to flipping through the selections he had available.  Every
sector of his fortress, and the surrounding lands around it, looked
relatively peaceful.  The occasional roboticized citizen would wander in,
look around, and walk back; either that, or someone would escort them
back...it had been learned that Joseph did not like uninvited guests
roaming around his property.  

However, it was relatively quiet around Knothole today, because everyone
was trying to readjust to their new surroundings.  So Joseph finally grew
bored with looking around, and began the day's work.  He would upload the
information he had taken out of Robotropolis the night before, and then
begin creating an antidote for the roboticization process...and then, he
could rest.  He walked over to the input port, and activated his dataspike.
He balled his left hand into a fist, bent it up toward the ceiling, 
and...clik.  Clik.  Clik.  Clik.

Nothing happened.  His arm looked like it did before.  Normally, the top of
his forearm would open up, and a 3" long spike would pop out.  Then, he
would insert it into the port, and begin a direct interface with the
computer.  But all he got now was an error message and a metallic `clik'.

Obviously, something was wrong with him.  Perhaps the Emerald had somehow
overloaded his arm, and it had just fused shut.  That could be fixed rather
easily, so this didn't start to bother him...yet.  All he did was to go up
to the repair level, and started a full diagnostic on his body.

As he walked on to the pad, as he had done many times before, he realized
he felt odd as the plasma rings went up and down his form, doing a routine
circuitry check.  Normally, he'd feel nothing.  But today, it was a
tingle...that was slowly turning into a stinging...that forced him to shut
off the scan out of self-preservation!

He quickly reviewed the results of the scan, and suddenly realized what the
problem was.

^L

He was flesh again.

He pondered this for a moment.  This was not necessarily a `bad'
thing...this was merely a very strange, abnormal thing.  He had a basic
idea of what the `why', `what', `who', and `when' was; obviously, the use 
of the Amber Chaos Emerald figured into it somehow.  But the `how', the 
`how'...a freakish nanite failure?  Impossible; nanites can't make metal
flesh again, and his repair systems would have kicked in to stop it.
A late-forming side effect of the DNA mutation from the power ring?
Highly improbable; the nanites were able to neutralize the reaction
after the initial change.

"So, hotshot," he muttered to himself, "what's done it?"

He hated to admit it, but the hated word `magic' seemed to be the `how'.

Joseph did not like the whole concept of magic.  It was like getting a
desired result without knowing -why- or -how- or -what- did it.  He did not
like just having blind faith in anything; his father had taught him that,
as his father taught him.  But this was the only (and he hated admitting
this) logical answer.

He sighed.  This situation was getting more annoying by the minute.
Maybe doing an internal diagnostic would help get his mind off of it.
He closed his eyes, and concentrated on reactivating as much of his former
abilities as possible...if there were any left.  But since he still had use
of his brain, that meant most of his android form's mental abilities would
be left...

He thought hard and unwaveringly about his task.  Normally, he could
activate all of his sensors and other powers in a nanosecond.  But
something had gone wrong due to the emerald.

He finally opened his eyes again.  It was hopeless.  He was 100% Mobian
hedgehog now, and there wasn't anything left inside of him to change
that--but outside...

"Bahb," he said, "prepare a brainscanning unit, to the following
specifications...."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Back in Robotropolis:

Packbell sat in the Control Center, overseeing the repairs of Robotropolis.
Snively's utter failure in running the city was obvious.  Only 25% of the
total possible SWATBot units were operational.  12% of the city had power.
Just over 35% of the Worker-Bots remained, and a good portion of it was on
fire.  Typical.

However, the repairs were going as well as could be expected.  He had
employed a large portion of the SWATBots with the Worker-Bots to increase
productivity, which was working out about as he'd predicted.  A few of the
refineries were going back online that afternoon, which would keep the city
operational while he worked on finding an alternative energy source.

For the time being, Packbell noted, the city would pretty much take care of
itself.  There was no need for him to sit and stare at it while it put
itself back together....so he could allot himself some leisure time. 
Turning away from the monitor screens, he smiled evilly at the thought he
had recently created.  He pushed the intercom button, paused for a moment,
and bellowed with all of his might into it!  "SNIVELY!!!!!  GET IN HERE 
*NOW*!!!"  He released the intercom button and laughed fiendishly, and
waited for the sound of Snively's footfalls rushing up the stairs.

Snively rushed up the stairs from the 3rd basement in the Command Center,
where Packbell had put his new room.  He knocked the filth and rubbish out
of the way as he clawed his way up the the lobby and rushed up the stairs.
He knew very well why Packbell was doing this, but if he wanted to live
another day, he would have to obey...

Packbell listened in silence as the short, large-nosed human desperately
threw himself up the stairs, probably taking some minor damage as he
climbed.  (Packbell didn't even begrudge Snively a stairrail...he had to
run up the stairs completely under his own power.)  After a few more
seconds, Snively burst in, falling at Packbell's feet.

Snively panted as he pushed out the words that Packbell forced him to say
every time he saw him.  "*pant*...Hail *pant* Supreme Commander *wheeze*
Packbell, Total *gasp* and Omnipotent *cough* Ruler of Moebius *pant*,
Conqueror of *wheeze* Robotropolis, and my *gasp* Almighty Lord."

Packbell kicked Snively out of his way.  "Good boy, Snotley."  He stood up,
looking down on the cringing human.  "Now, here is your task for the day. 
I want you to go back downstairs, and run to the other side of
Robotropolis.  There you will find a soda machine."  Packbell threw two
golden coins at Snivley, which hit him in the chest.  As he grabbed them,
Packbell continued to speak.  "Purchase a can of Fizz, and open it.  Then,
run back here, and hand it to me.  If so much as one drop is missing from
it," he stated, smiling evilly at Snively, "you die."

Packbell snapped his fingers.  "I want to see you back in...oh, let's make
it 5 minutes this time.  Now go!"  Snively quickly rushed out of the 
room, running for his very life.

Packbell laughed, and sat back down.  He giggled as he started his internal
chronometer....

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph stood in his lab as Bahb put the finishing touches on the
brainscanner he had instructed it to make.  It was similar to the neural
transfer device, but merely made a backup of one's memories and preserved
them on a storage device.  It was ideal for this situation's delicate
position...he didn't know how much time he had.

It was a rather nodescript device.  Basically, a long pipe that was
connected to the computer ended in a plunger-shaped scanning device, that
fit around Joseph's head with room to spare.  When the device was
activated, a slowly scanning ring of energy would pass up and down his
skull, taking a 3-D scan of his brain and replicating its design into a
file.  It would capture any thoughts he had since he was born, was having
now, and could predict what he was going to think 10 seconds later.  

He sat down under the device and allowed it to surround his head.  He
started to clear his mind of any thoughts, and ordered the scan to begin
when his mental activity was at its ebb.  He focused--and for 5 seconds,
his entire existance was blinked out.

A minute later, the device lifted, and Joseph's mind was returned to
normal.  He stood back up, shook his head a bit to reorient himself with
reality, and walked over to the console.

"Bahb, give me an ETC on the compliation of the brainscan."

Bahb hummed for a moment, and then emitted, "Estimated time of completion:
one solar cycle."

Joseph nodded.  "Very well.  I am going to go check on the Emerald, and
then I shall go outside to interact with the populace.  Give me a status
report hourly."  

Bahb beeped obiediantly, and set itself to its work.  After a moment of
silent contemplation of this development, Joseph opened the secret stepdisk
that led to the power core and rode down to examine it.

The sight of the emerald made Joseph feel better already, for some reason.
He had placed it where his old ship's power core had been, which he had
used to power the complex when he first arrived.  It glowed with a warm,
orangish light, and made him feel younger and stronger.  The room was
beginning to grow greenish energy crystal around the sides of it as well,
but only in a few isolated patches.  Either way, Joseph found the
development intriguing, and sought to encourage it...and perhaps, even
understand it.  

The annoyance toward the crystal could not be manifested here.  He simply
was too invigorated by its presence to be angry at it.  It was only an
inanimate object, after all...it couldn't hurt him...in fact, he rather
liked the glowing, warm emerald.  It radiated an almost maternal love and
happiness (perhaps an airborne antidepressant is created from its reaction
with the oxygen here, he mused) for all living things...  Occasionally, 
a swirl of a different color would be visible in it, but it would 
quickly fade back to its normal amber state.  

Joseph found the object beautiful.  He liked to look at it, feel its power,
and be near its warmth.  But he had a responcibility to check on his
various experiments on it; so he tore himself away from gazing on it, and
examined the readings that were taken of it instead.

The readings still made no sense to him.  He could detect all sorts of
radiation coming off of the emerald, yet still could not find any energy 
signatures that could tell him what the emerald was made out of.  On scans,
it showed the emerald as a black area, denoting an unknown substance.
But it gave off energy that could come from hydrogen up to element 534.
It contradicted itself.  According to most sciences, this object shouldn't
even exist in this universe...he decided he should probably give up on this
for the day.  Sighing as he walked away, he looked at the emerald one 
last time before he took the steppad back to the surface.   

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

He squinted somewhat as he stepped out of the Dome.  Normally, his optical
sensors would adjust within nanoseconds to the light change, but organics
took a bit more time.  He cursed them as he slowly adjusted to the photon
bombardment.

The Great Forest looked as it always did.  The trees were still there.  He
could hear the sounds of his creek in the distance, with the occasional
fish jumping out of the water.  It was `pretty' to most people, but it gave
Joseph a different sort of feeling.  All it was to him was a series of
subconscious distractions to keep people from getting too close to his
home.  But still, he enjoyed being around them.

He wandered to the creek, and sat down on a rock.  He gazed into the water
for a few moments, collecting his thoughts.  His life was spinning out of
control.  He had no family, no lover, no hope of escape.  From the moment
he set foot on this planet, it had started taking things from him.  His
ship.  A few droplets of blood, which must have wetted its thirst for more.
A clean conscience?  Good bye.  Even his last reminder of home, his own 
body, had been taken from him.  All because of this damn planet.  

But it was a good world, he mused.  There were nice people on it.  What was
happening here happened on his own world long ago; perhaps by helping it,
he'd help himself.  Besides, his was a black and cold culture...the
universe probably is better off without it.

He stood up.  Nay, he thought, it is gone 300 years now.  As the universe
has forgotten it, so shall I...they would have wanted it that way. 
"Progress over the antiquated, and those that lead the march shall live
forever in the hearts, minds, and actions of the next generation."  His
grandfather had said that all those years ago when he had given the Empire
the power of roboticization.  And he knew now that his words applied here.
He needed to evolve.  He was a outdated model of a line that had gone out
of production.  He pounded his fist into the palm of his other hand.  
It was time to make the leap to the new model year!

He sat down again and thought.  He wanted to be able to return to his fox
form; might as well not reinvent the wheel.  But the form of the hedgehog
would come in handy, too.  He also wanted some of his old android abilities
back, and especially some sort of neural net.  And, of course, he wanted 
to be able to utilize the Chaos Emerald again.  But, how could he do all
three feasibly? 

He pondered for a few moments.  He would have to design a body that could
do some limited shapshifting, but with resistance to powerful gamma (and
above) radiation.  Also, he would have to patch in cybernetics with it that
could handle the shifting and adjust quickly.  It would be a challenge, but
he was sure he could figure out a way to pull it off...

The spacecraft glided silently over Robotropolis, cloaked to all known
scanning devices on Mobius.  It quietly landed on the appropriate pad in
the center of Robotropolis, making no noise or signal that it had arrived.
A small hole seemed to open in reality as a figure emerged from inside the
cloaked vessel.  As the figure walked away, the hole closed, making the
ship completely invisible again.

The tall, slim creature quietly walked up the stairs, ignoring the various
SWATBots that ordered him to halt.  They fired at him, but their lazers
refracted off of the figure's personal shield.  After a while, they ceased
fire, and made way for the commanding, yet silent, figure.

Upstairs, Snively had just arrived, and was cowering before Packbell.
The figure, wanting to observe what was going on, arrived at the open door 
and phase-cloaked.  While invisible and untouchable, he listened to the 
banter that went back and forth...

"Well, Snively," Packbell exclaimed faux-happily, "you've gotten me my can 
of Fizz!"  He grinned in an unpleasant way.  "*Thank* *you* -so- much."
He then snatched the can from the cringing underling's hand, and threw it
violently out the window.  Upon seeing Snively's shocked and horrified
reaction, he laughed.  Then, his expression and tone became infuriated.  
"Now get out of my sight!"  After Snively had run off for his life,
Packbell sat back in his chair and had a good laugh.

"I see that you've inherited Ivo's sick sense of humor, tinkertoy."

Packbell sat up in his seat.  "Who said that?"

"It is not for you to know.  Tell me where Robotnik is."

Packbell blinked, and looked around.  "Where are you?!"

"Tell me where Robotnik is.  You have 30 seconds to comply."

Packbell stood up.  "I don't need to tell you anything.  I am the ruler--"

"20 seconds."

Packbell became irate, and pushed the intercom button.  "SWATBots!  Report 
to the Command Center *immediately*!"

The voice grew increasingly more annoyed.  "10 seconds, tinkertoy."

SWATBots streamed into the Command Center as Packbell began shouting at
them to find the voice.  The voice even whistled quietly so to assist them,
but they couldn't seem to get their hands on him.

"Time's up, tinkertoy.  Where is Robotnik?"

Packbell cursed and angrily looked around for the voice.  "Show yourself!"

"Very well."

In the center of the room, about 3 feet from Packbell, a humanoid figure
began to materialize.  It was about 6'4, about 190 pounds, and was vulpine.
He had reddish fur, with hints of orange in it.  His silver pupils glared 
at Packbell, and his silver canines glinted against his otherwise
natural-appearing teeth.  He was clad in a black trenchcoat that went down 
to his calves, and was wearing a uniform-like suit under it.  His black
boots went over his pants, and his white fingerless gloves gave him a
distrubing appearance.

"I seek Robotnik.  You will tell me where to find him, or you will be
terminated."

Packbell looked at the figure.  "And why should I tell you anything?"

The figure grabbed Packbell's throat at an unnatural speed, and began to
squeeze it tightly.  "Because, tinkertoy, I said so."

The SWATBots tried to move to act, but collectively realized that movement
to assist Packbell would most likely result in his termination.  So they
simply stood at attention as the figure continued to speak.  "If I didn't
have a liking for Robotnik," it said, "I'd simply break you in half right
now, and use your entrails as materials for a selection of post-modernist
art."  He moved his face uncomfortably close to Packbell's.  "So cut 
the attitude and tell me where he *is*."

Packbell tried to squeak out an answer, but the figure had closed off his
windpipe.  Realizing this, the nameless one threw Packbell back into his
seat.  "Tell me -NOW-!"

Packbell took a few breaths, reacclimating his lungs so to be able to
produce an answer.  "Robotnik," he wheezed, "is dead."

The figure looked temporarily surprised, but resumed his normal demeanor.
"So, Ivo finally managed to get killed...  I told him his idiotic Doomsday
project was doomed to failure."

Packbell looked at the figure confusedly.  "You'd been communicating with
Ivo?"

The figure resumed his cold stare at Packbell.  "Yes...my people have an
interest in this world.  We would...well, would have liked to acquire 
it from Ivo."  He paused.  "So I suppose you have possession of it now?"
Packbell nodded, and started to speak, "But..."

The figure raised his hand for silence.  "Very well.  We will simply
continue the negotiations with you.  But first, we will require an updated
manifest of your possessions.  Would you happen to have the latest one 
available?"

Packbell nodded, thinking.  "Give me 30 seconds to produce one."  He walked
over to the console, pushed a few buttons, and displayed a file on the main
viewer.  "I had wondered what this was..."

He rose his hand again for quiet, reading...  "You've suffered some losses
recently, haven't you?"

Packbell nodded, silently cursing the idiocy of Snively.  "A minor
catasthophe occured when one of my underlings took control of the main city
while I was on a brief hiatus."

The figure mused.  "Yes...was it the hedgehog again?"

"You know about Sonic?"

The figure looked over at Packbell.  "I'm beginning to despise that
accursed vandal as much as Ivo...did."  He muses.  "Well, have you tried
using nanites to get rid of him?"

"Yes."

"Tried making a robot version of his little girlfriend and have her kill
him?"  

"Yes."

"Tried to use his ego against him?"

"Tried it."

"Broke his will?"

"Unbreakable."

"Killed some of his friends?"

"Several.  Hasn't phased him."

"Kidnapping?"

"Many, many times."

The figure hmmed.  "Well, you're on your own, then."  He looked back at the
monitor, and tsked.  "My, my, my.  You've lost over 75% of your Worker-Bots
in the past 3 years.  This won't do at all.  This planet was already a
fixer-upper, and now most of its work force has escaped."

He looked back at Packbell.  "I'm afraid Ivo's original price for
this world is just too high."

Packbell blinked.  "Price?"

The figure looked surprised.  "He never infor--oh yes, silly me.  He didn't
want the possibility of a Freedom Fighter finding out that he was going to
sell this planet to the highest bidder."

Packbell stood there, his positronic brain temporarily locked up.  He could
not justify in his mind a reason to sell Mobius.  After all, it was Ivo's
home, right...?

"And, naturally, this development is simply going to lower what we are
willing to give.  We were hoping to convert this planet into a colony
world...it will take a bit longer, now; we'll have to recapture the already
roboticized citizens, and polish off the rest.  But I assure you, you'll
still get a very nice package for this..."  He smiled evilly.  "very rustic
little world." 

Packbell snapped out of his lockup, forming a plan.  "Understood.  What are
your new terms?"

The figure started to turn away.  "I will have to update my people on this
development first.  I will return in about 2 of your Mobian weeks.  For
now, we will leave the promised...gift below with your SWATBots."

As he faded from view again, Packbell got to his feet.  "Wait!  I don't
even know your name!"

As he slipped back into the shadows, he whispered, "Call me...John."

With that, he disappeared, leaving behind a confused and puzzled Packbell.
After a few moments of processing this new influx of data, he pushed the
intercom button.  "SWATBot Squad 34-G: retrive the crate left by our
visitors, and bring it to me."  A compliant beep was heard, and then the
intercom automatically shut off.

The SWATBot squad went down to the pad, where a small crate was being set
out by some lowly-looking red foxes.  They scurried back inside the
light-hole, and disappeared.  A few moments after that, a dim hum was
heard, and something seemed to leave the area.  A hole was poked in the
clouds, allowing the outline of the saucer-shaped craft to be seen before
it faded into space.

The SWATBots didn't really notice that as they carefully picked up the
crate and walked into the freight elevator.  SWATBots are not creative
machines; they are rather dull, and aren't great conversationalists.
They merely follow orders.

The platoon of SWATBots arrived inside the Command Center, and placed the
box by Commander Packbell.  They stepped away from it, saluted, and walked
back to their posts.  Packbell waited for them to leave before opening the
box.  He carefully popped the top off of it, and pulled off the nearest side.
A wave of packing material fell at his feet as he removed the object from the
crate...

It was a long object, about the length of a baseball bat.  There was a hole
on one side, and a power cell attached to the other.  It had a button
on the top by an aiming sight, and an shoulder rest.  A few extra power
cells were attached to it by some shrinkwrap, with a note.  Packbell put
the device down for a moment, and opened up the note; which read:

"Ivo: This is the latest revision of our basic plasma cannon.  We've
altered the power cells so they can be charged by your power stations.
The usual schematic is inside the shrinkwrap.  Enjoy!  -- T."

Packbell smiled.  So this is how Ivo kept `developing' the new technologies
they had been utilizing!  He sat down in the chair, and begin to analyze
the new device...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The day had passed uneventfully at Knothole.  The initial chaos of having
an influx of new villagers had been taken care of, and everyone had settled
in well.  Everyone had gotten their work assignments, which really began to
fly by...the day's work usually would end at noon, thanks to the
introduction of new technologies and the muscle power of the roboticized
citizens.  So the rest of the day had been a needed relaxation period for
most people, while Sally and the rest of the military section of the
Freedom Fighters planned their next raid.

But, deep inside Joseph's lab, the events of the surface were of little
concern.  He had spent most of the day running simulations...and he had
figured out the exact DNA he would need in order to create something to his
specifications; a mixture of Keldy'rian, Ur'thaen, Mobian, and a bit he had
strung together himself would be the matrix for his new shell.  The
Keldy'rian would be the conduit for the Ur'thaen and Mobian DNA, and would
hold all three together while only allowing one to manifest at a time.  In
a nutshell, it would give him the ability to appear to be either a normal
Ur'thaen orange fox, or a normal Mobian orange hedgehog, while being able
to switch to one or the other freely.  The extra bits of DNA he had added
would give his new body the ability to withstand extremely high radiation
for unlimited amounts of time, and be sure that his body would not reject
the cybernetics he was going to add.

He was especially proud of the way he was going to be able to maintain his
intelligence within the form.  If he was home on Ur'thae, this would have
gotten him the same level of accolades that his father had recieved for the
neural transfer device; he had perfected a mimetic polyalloy.  

His people had tried for decades to perfect one that would maintain
molecular consistancy yet be able to remember programming and instructions.
But all of them had failed for one reason or another...but not this one.
Not only would it be able to remember and maintain his own personality
matrix, but it would maintain the knowledge he had already acquired *and*
was able to hold an unlimited amount of additional data.  It would be the
perfect central nervous system; all he would have to do is to inject it
into the new form (after the brain and nervous systems had been removed)
and it would take over.  

At last, he would have the ideal, nearly perfect body he had always wanted.
Free of the worries of brain or other physical death, yet still organic.
Enhanced sensor sensitivity, fast nervous system, highly resistant to
outside influence, genetically compatable with most other species...and,
with the addition of nanites, almost instant healing and a nearly 
invincible immune system.  It was a form that could last for as long as he
wanted it to.

After doing some final bits of tweaking, he began the creation process...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

But up on the surface, a mission was being planned.  The usual suspects,
Sally, Sonic, Rotor, Antoine, Dulcy, Charles, Bunnie, and Tails were standing 
around an updated aerial view of Robotropolis, figuring out the 
Worker-Bot details for that night.  Tails was mostly in the background,
tho, listening.

"...and that's how we're going to do that.  Remember, Snively probably
realizes that we'll strike here, so it's going to be a hard fight.
Therefore, it's a fair bet that there'll be lots of SWATBots around,
guarding the Worker-Bots.  That's why only Sonic will actually go in to get
the group of citizens, while Dulcy, Antoine and Bunnie will assist people in
escaping.  I will lead a diversion with Charles and Rotor that will strike
on the opposite side of Robotropolis, forcing Snively to spread out a few
platoons of SWATBots at us." 

She paused, looking for questions.  Finding none, she deactivated the
hologram.  "We will leave for Robotropolis at the usual time.  Dulcy will
drop Charles, Rotor, and myself off first.  Five minutes after she has
returned here, Bunnie and Antoine will leave for Robotropolis, with Sonic
having an approximate head start of 10 seconds."  She smiled.  "Dismissed."

An hour or two later, thanks to the science of age-acceleration, Joseph's 
body had completed being grown.  The mimetic polyalloy had been injected 
without incident to take over the nervous system, and it had created a 
datajack in the center of the back of its neck to permit Joseph to upload 
himself into it.  Everything had gone according to plan.

Now, Joseph waited for Bahb to complete processing the collected
information of his life he had given it that morning.  It was just about
completed; Bahb had sped up the process considerably, thanks to the long
periods of zero input he had endured.  In another five minutes, it would be
completed.

He drank his coffee and admired his old form one last time.  He tapped it
somewhat, smiled, and laid down on the guerney.  It pulled itself over
underneath the intelligence transfer unit, next to his new form.  The
device went down over both of their craniums, and activa--

Reality stopped.

^L

Reality started.

Joseph opened his eyes in his new form as the old one was derezzed.  The
device lifted away from his face, and he hopped off the guerney.  He
noticed that he was already back in his normal vulpine form.  Success!
He walked over to the mirror, which confirmed his suspicions.

He was a normal, breathing flesh-and-blood fox again!

Quickly, he tested out his mimetic polyalloy brain.  He pulled up his
heads-up display faster than he ever had before.  He scanned the room in
every spectrum of electromagnetic radiation he could surmise.  Perfect!
He did an internal diagnostic.  Everything was at 100% -or- -greater-!
He was better off than he was before!  He did some backflips to celebrate,
and to test the agility of his new body.  Perfectperfectperfect!

But there was one final test.  He closed his eyes, and thought of becoming
a hedgehog....he was overtaken by a sense of vertigo....he opened his
eyes...and was a hedgehog.  Yes!  This RULED.  He closed his eyes, and
thought of becoming a fox again...the vertigo...and then he was.

He was so proud of himself.  He'd finally done something worthwhile with
his abilities...then he remembered.  The files he had gotten from
Robotropolis!  Were they still there?!  He closed his eyes and searched...

[NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE]

Joseph cursed.  He must have lost them during the transfer.  He'd have to
go back and get them again...of course, he couldn't just go out and
steal them like he did last time.  That was an extremely lucky break.
No, he would have to think of a new way of going about getting what he
needed...his super-strength, for example, was no longer present.
He'd have to find a way to deal with that.  Of course, he'd have to explain
to the others how he had returned to his `natural' state, and find a way of
getting to and from Robotropolis as quickly as possible.  He certainly
didn't want to mooch a ride off that dragon.  Too unreliable.  He'd have to
get around to building some sort of transportation one of these days.

But that would wait until later.  Right now, he'd be content with simply
shifting into his hedgehog state, running to the edge of Robotropolis, and
allowing the Freedom Fighters to distract Snively while he stole as much
data as possible.  Then, he'd run back home, and return to normal as Bahb
processed it.  He'd extrapolate the needed data, and have Bahb rig up
deroboticizer software.  Then, he'd build the necessary device, and finally
begin repairing his father's mistake once and for all...in an orderly
fashion, to boot.

For now, he'd bide his time until nightfall, enjoying being a fox again,
and perhaps he'd work in a brief martial arts practice period before he
left...so much to do, so little time!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Night fell on the surface, and the majority of Knothole turned in for the
evening's rest.  Only a few denziens of Knothole, the ones going on the
actual mission stayed awake.

Dulcy airlifed Sally, Charles, and Rotor to Robotropolis, where they were
planning on sabotaging a chip manufacturing facility.  Upon her return,
Bunnie and Antoine were taken to the other side of Robotropolis, where a
large group of Worker-Bots were working under heavy guard on repairing a
SWATBot production plant.  Sonic shot after them, and hid in the shadows
until the diversion started.

A minute or two later, Joseph came out of the Dome, ready to do an assult
on Robotropolis as well.  He had his personal shield unit fully charged,
had a small phaser attached to his side, and was at 100% efficiency.
He took a path that would lead him into the center of Robotropolis with as
little difficulty as could be expected.  He'd have to dodge the occasional
squad of SWATBots (and who knows what else), but he figured he could always
teleport out if it got too hot.  He hoped.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sonic arrived at Robotropolis a minute before Dulcy did.  He paused to
examine his current target, a refinary.  SWATBots were assisting the
Worker-Bots this time...guarding and working at the same time.  Clever, the
hedgehog thought, but not Way Past Cool.  He plotted a course of attack,
figuring in the large amount of SWATBot fire that was bound to occur.  It
appeared everything was going to go as expected...yet, something seemed 
amiss to the hedgehog.  It was unlike Snively to use his SWATBots for actual
`work'...just Freedom Fighter-shooting and patrolling.  This stunk of
something fishy.  Big Time.  

He heard Dulcy land in the distance, far enough away so not to be spotted
by 'Bot planes when leaving Robotropolis.  Now, all they had to do was wait
for the--

An explosion in the distance lit the sky as alarms started to sound.  Sally
had set off the charges around the SWATBot production plant, slowing the
further regeneration of Snively's troops.  That'd get him steamed for sure.
He listened for the usual screechy howling from the loudspeakers, cursing
for all available SWATBots to destroy `that hedgehog', no matter who
actually -did- it.  Bulbhead was pretty low-watt.

But not a voice was to be heard.  Yet, the SWATBots put down what they were
doing, climbed into 'Bot planes, and flew off toward the explosion.  Sonic
was puzzled for a moment, and then remembered that SWATBots could take
orders by certain radio frequencies, too; encrypted, of course.  But
Snively had never thought of that before...maybe he was finally starting to
catch on about this `badnik' business.  Nah.

He waited for the majority of them to leave before readying himself for the
attack.  It appeared that about a squad was left, something Sonic would
normally be able to take care of in an instant....it still didn't feel
right.  It was as if a 6th sense had noticed something deeper than his keen
hedgehog eyesight couldn't detect.

He was wasting precious time with this wimpyness, he thought.  What am I,
Ant?  He scoffed at that, imagining how panicky Ant would be in a situation
like this.  That's why he was always left in someone else's care, noted
Sonic, and started into a run--

A glitter of 'Bot metal from around a corner.  That's all Sonic needed 
to see.  Now he knew this was an ambush; his delay had allowed him to see
what was coming.  Past Cool!  Wait.  Way Uncool.  Now he'd have to either
turn back now, warn Dulcy and risk hanging around here without doing
anything until Sally ordered the evac; or fight through a few squads of
SWATBots and risk being captured, killed, or roboticized.  Hmmmm...

Discretion is the better part of valor, it is said.  If that is so, Sonic
was slightly worse off than Antoine in that department.  He took out a
power ring, took out his free-will inducing pistol, and blasted off into
the now-expected `ambush'.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph approached the front gates into Robotropolis, his cloak active.
He stealthily approached the main door, listening for activity.  Only a few
SWATBots were around now...the Freedom Fighters had probably distracted the
rest of them.  But, of course, this was to his advantage.

He snuck inside the gates with no incident.  Walking quietly by some
SWATBots, who were barely even paying attention to anything behind them, he
wandered closer into the heart of Robotropolis.  Some repairs had been
completed since last night; a few buildings had tarps on them to keep the
outdoors out, while a few piles of garbage had been tended to.  This was
odd to Joseph; Snively would not normally take such care of Robotropolis.  
Then, he detected the familiar sounds of distant explosions and lazer fire 
echoing in the distance.  Joseph listened carefully to them, and concluded
they would not become a threat.  At least, it was improbable that they
would.  He hurried up somewhat, not wanting to tempt fate.  

Joseph approached the Command Center, and was mildly surprised.  The
Command Center was actually -guarded- today with SWATBots.  Finally, he
thought, Snively had got on the ball.  You can't just leave a fortress, no
matter how formitable, unguarded.  Roughly two squads guarded the main
entrance, while 3 or 4 were watching over the minor entrances.  This would
actually be an enjoyable challenge to infiltrate, Joseph mused, and walked
closer to the main entrance.

The SWATBots took little notice of the cloaked figure before them...they
didn't have the amount of imagination required to put together that the
occasional disturbance around 3 feet above ground level was not caused by
some sort of fumes, nor were they merely the product of a heat-producing
device underground.  They merely ignored it, and kept scanning the horizon
for threats they could comprehend.

Joseph crouched on the ground, looking for an opening.  He kept waiting for
a SWATBot to move, or for something to occur near enough to them to trigger
some sort of response.  Nothing.  He stared at the SWATBots.  The SWATBots
looked out over him.  He waited.  They didn't move.  Finally, he sat down
and thought for a little while.  What would cause me to panic, if *I* was a
SWATBot...having an idea, he rushed off back into Robotropolis.

A few minutes went by.  The SWATBots still stood there, emotionlessly
waiting for a stimulus to respond to.  Then, a low hum was heard in the
distance.  The SWATBots sent queries among themselves, trying to determine
the cause of the noise.  It drew nearer.  The SWATBots armed their
wrist-blasters and waited.  Then, it went further away.  Automatically, the
SWATBots went back on standby.  A few more minutes went by.  The hum
returned, and then left.  This was starting to make even the most
uncreative SWATBot among them suspicious, and a few of them broke rank to
investigate.  The hum remanifested after the SWATBots would have gotten
close enough to hear it...but suddenly, the sounds of SWATBots getting
fried were the precursors to a very fast, rocket-powered red blur racing 
past the Control Center.  The SWATBots immediately started to pursue the
blur, and called for backup.  

After most of them had left, Joseph walked out from behind some
semi-demolished architecture, and wandered into the more invasion-friendly
Control Center.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph was yet again greeted by the odd semi-cleanliness of Robotropolis.
This was beginning to get ridiculous, he mused.  Snively is definitely not
behind this; but if not Snively, who?

He went over to the stairwell, only to stop short of opening it: an alarm
was attached to a low-powered lazer, which had set up a bounce-pattern
around the door that made entering by that method impossible.  Whoever was
behind this had a knowledge of security that was beyond Snively's...so how
would he continue to ascend into the Control Center into the central
computer core?  He pondered, and then flattened himself against a wall as a
group of SWATBots walked over to a wall.  The head SWATBot sent a small
blink of red light into a panel, opening an freight elevator up.  Before it
could close behind them, Joseph poured on a little hedgehog speed and
zipped into the elevator.

The wall shut in front of the elevator, and it started to ascend...

Joseph stood in the midst of 4 SWATBots, all of them oblivious to his
presence and busy communicating amongst themselves in a sort of robotic
gossip.  Joseph listened in to the conversation, which was mainly a dull
discussion of the new policies that would be implemented in Robotropolis
as of such and such, blah blah blah.  He caught snippets of the important
stuff, tho...a more agressive search for Knothole, a continuation of
roboticization of captured citizens, rather than termination for offenses
against...`Packbell'?

Joseph had heard the name in the occasional conversations he'd
`unintentionally' listen in on.  Apparently, `Commander' Packbell was an
android like he used to be, but with a (and this had made him chuckle)
-positronic- brain.  He almost giggled in the elevator when he thought
about it...he'd built a positronic brain when he was a child.  It was his
final exam for his admission into what would be `4th' grade on Mobius.
They were comically inefficient, they locked up when chaotic situations
(like the majority of situations in life) occurred, they learned
slowly...all they were good for was memorizing things and applying what
they learned to certain tasks.  But their thought patterns ran to practical
means.  You could stun one with a good, hard riddle, and pretty much fry
one by leaving it in the presence of a few kits.  But a few of the more
`advanced' (ha-ha) ones had simple emotions...it was very possible that
Packbell had somehow returned from whereever he had been hiding for all
these months, and taken back over Robotropolis.  It would explain the
strange and semi-intelligent security measures that had recently taken
place.

The door opened, and the SWATBots (and Joseph) left the elevator.  They
were on a lower level than Joseph would have wanted, but hitchhiking never
got one hand-delivered anywhere.  So, he looked around, and tried to figure
out what he could usefully do from this area.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

It was a basic sub-level of any good fortress.  It was a SWATBot storage
area, and had some basic supplies present in it.  No windows, but dim
lighting that was just enough so SWATBots could manuver their way around
inside.  However, they did Joseph's regular vision no good.  He switched to
I/R, which was usually easier to utilize.

Ahh, here we go.  He was standing at the end of a corridor that stretched
down around the curvature of the building.  A few sliding doors were on the
side, for quick SWATBot dispersal.  The floor was solid, but there was a
grate in the ceiling that might lead higher up into the complex.  He'd have
to investigate that soon enough.  However, he might as well explore around
in here while he had the chance to at a leisurely pace.  After all, he
had--he checked his internal power gauges--about 2 hours left of full cloak
before he'd have to start heading home...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, back on the surface:

Sonic had dispatched the majority of the SWATBots that were at the complex,
due to the fact that they had anticipated on having the element of
surprise.  He'd gotten a few Worker-Bots conscious and out, but he found
that few others were about.  But, he had gotten some of them out, so the
mission wasn't a total failure.

However, the SWATBots seemed to be crawling out of the walls...the more of
them he was able to destroy, the more that seemed to appear.  They had
also scored a few nicks on him; mainly in the back, ironically enough.
But the outcome of the battle was still uncertain.  They wouldn't get
Chuck, Bunnie, Ant, Sal, Rotor or Dulcy...they had escaped with the platoon of
Worker-Bots he'd sent out with them.  At least they'd thought of that.
But he had one last hope; his power ring.  The only thing was, they'd never
back off enough to let him take it out, concentrate, and then juice.  They
kept coming, so he'd have to keep spin-dashing through them.  And he was
getting tired.  Way Past Uncool.  Unless he kept moving, they'd grab him,
and then it'd be Game Over...but, just when all appeared lost, and Sonic 
was about to pass out from exhaustion, a great roar was heard drawing
near... 

To the amazement of Sonic and the SWATBots assaulting him, Robotnik's old
hovercraft, albeit worse for wear, was the source of the fire!

It swooped out of the sky, cannons blazing, and started strafing the
SWATBot platoons.  'Bot after 'Bot fell to its rampage, most retreating
after the first pass.  With flames licking out from beneath it, it scooped
the hedgehog and roared back into the sky.

After a moment of adjusting to the shock, Sonic looked up from the floor of
the hovercraft and saw a hazy image of an orange hedgehog.  "Huh?" he
grunted, trying to grab onto something solid.

"Hello, Sonic," the image said, "and no, I'm not really Joseph.  I'm a 
holographic image of Joseph, programmed with a limited amount of his
knowledge.  He quickly assembled me as a diversion, but since I saw you in
a spot of trouble, I decided to assist you as well."

Sonic was still reassembling his senses.  Then, a chili dog and a Fizz [tm]
soda appeared before him.  "Please, consume this food," the image said, "it
will help your body recover its needed nutrients."

He quickly bolted down the food, and reacquired his basic personality
matrix.  "Whoa," he amazedly said, realizing exactly what was going on,
"Joe put you together as just a -diversion-?"

The figure nodded as the craft roared faster around Robotropolis.  "He
required an intelligence to fly the craft around to distract SWATBots. 
There were too many around the Command Center for him to elude."

Sonic blinked.  "Allow me to explain," the image said, and filled Sonic in
on the finer details of what had occurred within the last 48 hours.

"So that's why he keeps tagging along," Sonic said, "he wants to get the
info right from the source!  And our missions were the perfect diversions
for him.  Way Past Smart!"

The image smiled as the craft dodged some incoming lazer fire.  "He'd thank
you for that...but now I must complete my function."  He flickered for a
moment.  "You might wish to hold on to something, hedgehog," the image
twittered, "because it's going to get very bumpy in a moment."

Sonic nodded and strapped himself in.  "Hold on," the computer said, and
set the craft into a 3G turn...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph navigated the halls for a while, but then realized there was nothing
of value to him inside here.  Not a solitary dataport was on this level;
he'd have to go up further into the complex to find such a device.  So, he
wandered back to where he started, opened up the grate, and climbed inside.

He crawled around inside the grates for a while, listening for the familiar
sounds of humming computers.  He climbed up a few 75 degree planes, jumped
up into a sheer ventcliff, and finally seemed to get close enough to the
computer room to hear it...

Looking through the grate, he saw the familiar R&D room.  However, it was
guarded by a few SWATBots this time, so it would be unwise to merely bust
through the grate.  No, a more subtle method would need to be used...so, he
chose to crawl further down the line, outside the R&D room itself.

He looked out this grate, and noticed guards outside the R&D room itself as
well.  Packbell was certainly paranoid, wasn't he?  He mused for a moment.
How could he get rid of both guards without alerting anyone else of it?
His phaser certainly wouldn't be quiet enough, and smashing them would be
even worse.  He leaned against the wall and thought harder...and had an
idea.  An insane, completely stupid idea, but one that just might work.
He remembered how Sonic had told him once that he was able to free Sally
from a cell by impersonating Robotnik to a computer.  So if Sonic could do
it with a cup, Joseph could certainly do it with his precision mimicry
programming.  He concentrated on the sound of Robotnik's voice...adjusted
his vocal chords accordingly...and then announced out the grate:

"Attention all SWATBots!  Report to the lobby IMMEDIATELY!"

He looked out the grate, and waited for the incoming fire.  But that didn't
happen...appearently, SWATBots must be programmed to obey Robotnik's voice;
because not only the ones in front of the door rushed off to the elevator,
but the ones inside pursued them!  Joseph was oddly surprised, but he was 
never one to look a gift horse in the mouth--he kicked out the grate 
and rushed inside the R&D room.  As his vocal chords returned to normal, 
he popped out his dataspike and quickly did the 2-second download of 
all of Robotropolis' information.

This, of course, set off every alarm in the entire complex.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Packbell had been busy ordering about SWATBot squads and 'Bot planes when
the main alarm system finally went off.

<< RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  SECURITY BREACH IN SECTOR 2-ALPHA! >>

He immediately sprung out of his seat, ordered all SWATBots to continue
their respecitive pursuits, and grabbed his plasma cannon from off a table.
After he had armed it properly, he burst out the door and ran down the
hall, in an especially bad mood.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph emerged from the R&D lab rapidly, also in a angry mood.  He
shouldn't have been in such a hurry.  Now he'd really have a problem
escaping from here with all his quills attached.  He looked down the hall,
and saw a humanoid figure toting...

He increased magnification and enhanced the image.  He scanned it twice to
be sure, but it was.  He dared not say it, for he did not wish to reveal
any information inadvertantly to this individual (besides, he was still
cloaked).  But he knew he could not leave without it.  But how could he get
it from him, and yet not risk staying here to fight him?

As he got closer, he tried to scramble behind a wall, but bumped into
something going the opposite way and stumbled forward.  His forward
momentum caused his foot to stick out from the corner of the wall, directly
within Packbell's path.  As Packbell drew closer to the corner, he tripped
over the hedgehog's foot and fell forward, dropping the gun from the shock.
The gun spun across the floor to the foot of an open elevator, which then
lodged itself between the inside of the elevator and the hallway; holding
the door open.

Several things happened very fast after that.

Joseph, not wanting to miss an opportunity, scrambled over Packbell
(leaving an imprint in his face from his boot) and shot into the open
elevator.  The thing he had bumped into happened to be a SWATBot, which
shot in the direction of the motion.  Joseph spun, grabbed the gun from the
door, and slipped to the side--as the door closed, deflecting the blast.
Quickly, he toggled the down button, leaving the floored Packbell alone to
pummel the SWATBot in anger.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

As the door opened at the lobby, Joseph was immediately besieged by SWATBot
fire.  (Perhaps it was a mistake to send them down there after all.)  He
blasted a few of them, but mostly fired wildly as he used his innate
hedgehog speed to race his way out of the complex, leaving a blue-hot trail
of plasma behind him.  

As he raced toward the exit of the city, trying madly to evade the
entourage of 'Bot planes he'd attracted, he wondered what wrong life
decision led him into this situation...but his brooding was interrupted by
the familiar-sounding roar of the hovercraft as it smote his pursuers.  Now
he was the one rescued as the hovercraft swooped down from the sky and
grabbed him from the earth.

Now Joseph, Sonic, and his hologram raced through Robotropolis, being
blasted at by anti-aircraft cannons. 

"Joe!" Sonic yelled, ducking a few bursts of lazer fire.

"Yeah, Sonic?" was the reply from Joseph as he took control of the craft.

"Do you have," Sonic hollered, "a plan!?"

Joseph shouted back, "No!"

"That makes the both of us!"

"Good!" was the last retort, as a shot from a 'Bot plane finally crippled
the craft, sending it spiraling down...down...

^L

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The two hedgehogs jumped from the craft instinctively, but they both soon
realized bailing out about five thousand feet over hostile territory with
not a parachute between them is not a good idea.

Sonic and Joseph let out a long, collective scream as they plummeted toward
a rather unpleasant part of Mobius, waiting for the bright light to start
shining before them.  After all, neither of them could *fly*...

However, Dulcy could.  And she cracked the whip in the nick of time, and
saved the two hedgehogs from becoming greasy spots on the pavement.  As
they calmed down and flew away from Robotropolis, the banter began again.

"Hey," Sonic said, "my life just flashed before my eyes!"

"My breakfast just flashed before mine," Joseph said weakly.

The rest of the flight passed in silence.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Everyone was glad to see Joseph and Sonic when they returned.  Well, that
is, except Sally.  After accepting a round of applause, Sally dragged the
both of them back into her hut, demanding an explaination.

"What did you two think you were doing out there?!"

"Just getting my butt saved!" was Sonic's initial reply.  "If Joseph hadn't
pulled the hat-trick and had his diversion come get me, I would've been
fried!"  

"You shouldn't have stayed to begin with, Sonic Hedgehog!  If you knew that
the odds were against you--"

"Tell *that* to the people I just bailed out of there, Sal!"

A pause.

Sally's voice grew softer.  "Sonic...those people would have been there
tomorrow.  We could have gotten more out if you could have waited--"  She
immediately saw the response forming in Sonic's head.  "--and, yes, I know,
you aren't the waiting type."  Her voice rose again.  "But what you did 
was foolish!  It was insane!  It was--"

"Honorable," Joseph said.  "and it was something I would have done, if I
would have been in the same place."

Sally looked over at Joseph, and shook her index finger at him harshly. 
"And *you*, you maniac, what possessed you to go and invade Snively's--"

"Packbell's, ma'am."

Sally blinked.  "What?"

"Packbell's, ma'am.  Packbell has unseated Snively.  He is in charge now."

Sally's anger left her.  "Dear Lord..."

Joseph nodded.  "It is rather unfortunate.  But I was able to get important
information out of his computers, and capture a piece of very sensitive
technology."  He hefted the cannon out in front of Sally.  "I need to run
tests on this, but I believe it may utilize an...alien technology.  Perhaps
it would give us a clue to who is helping...umm, Packbell now, I guess."

He put his hand on Sally's shoulder.  "Boss, I know what I did was
unsanctioned by you, and was certainly an unwise thing to do tactically. 
But I did get positive results, and I will have more developments for you
in the coming days as I analyse this data."  Then, Joseph bowed slightly.
"I will make this up to you."

Sally just blinked, her initial anger defused.  "Well, okay, Joseph.  Just
don't pull any more crazy stunts like this again."  She coughed, regaining
her normal voice.  "Dismissed."

Joseph smiled softly.  "Affirmative."  And then, he walked out of the hut.

Sonic blinked.  "Packbell's in charge?  Way Past Uncool, Sal!  What'll we
do now?"

Sally turned away from Sonic, and looked out the window.  "I don't know,
Sonic...I don't know..."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph returned to his lab, and placed the cannon down in front of him.
He stared at it for a while, transfixed on the information that identified
the kind of weapon, its make, and its year.  He stared at it for a while,
hoping that if he glared at it long enough, the familiar language would
change, as well as its information.

He touched it, feeling the steely perfection of its design.  It was
probably built by a machine, yet it retained that familiar workmanship
that was so familiar to him...

He could not let them know.  Not yet.  He would be lynched, burned, and
possibly drawn and quartered; and his work would die here, on this
desolate, primitive world so far from civilized space.

He took a power sander from the table, and fired it up to its full power.
In a burst of strength, he slowly tore away the paint that held the
accursed phrase on the side of the weapon...

"UR'THAEN PLASMA CANNON, MARK 26-ALPHA.  MODEL YEAR -- 8000 PE..."

Most StH fans are in the Sonic mailing list, it seems. Also, I'm on the

the removal of fan art from the main StH FTP/WWW site, even though the

of circumstances, I'm ready to kill the project. :( I'd honestly like to

now, but I will say this to Sega: Keep an eye on what is about to unfold 
between WB Animation and WB fans- Preliminary talks may be paving the way 
for studio-approved fanworks distribution on the net that DOES include 
the "naughty" bits. I cannot say much more than that right now, and won't 
until an approved system is set up, which may be a couple months...

All I'll say is that there ARE copyright and trademark laws and court 
rulings that allow precedent for toon erotica, which Sega's actions 
against rat.org violate.

In the meantime, would anyone mind encouraging a fellow StH fan 
(especially a Bunnie fan) to stay?

I'm sure _somebody_ will, but it won't be me... (not meant as a flame, but 
I can't honesly put a smiley in there either...)

Note to fan-fic authors (nobody in particular though): if your story 
contains sex, violence, or other possibly disturbing stuff, I suggest you 
note that prominently at the beginning of it.  I could handle the grimness 
of the show itself, but much of the fan-fic fic has gone an order of 
magnitude beyond that, and it's too much for me.

In fact, since I haven't read much of the fan-fic that's been sent to the 
list (I've stuck it in a "to read" directory, but don't know when I'll get to 
it), would some volunteer out there like to summarize all the fan-fic done 
so far in terms of plot and a rating re. violence/sex/whatever?

No argument with the former, but (at the risk of trying to grab 
credit/glory, which I don't mean to do) I sort of thought _I_ had something 
to do with the latter; I started (and still have) a mini-mailing list over 
a year ago and Erich (and others?) took the idea and made it a _real_ list.

Maybe it can be an alternate version of BAM and a crossover could occurr,

I would have to agree with Ron here, and had been planning the very 
thought of just such a disclaimer. (My planned story, as yet no title, 
was planned as a romance at a time when what was left of Mobius was being 
rebuilt...)

I guess that even under the most dire of circumstances, I believe in 
hope, which is why I really liked the SatAM (now SunAM) StH, because it 
*was* a positive theme within a grim world...

That is a very good idea, though I'd have to say Bookshire's WWW story 
page does just that!

I guess you don't know what did lead to the creation of the Sonic list 
then. For the record, I'll explain:

During the time I was proposing a.f.s-h in alt.config, a teenager going 
by the handle "Tom Servo", who was already notorious for bogus newsgroup 
creations, decided to proclain (and then proceeded to) that he will 
create every newsgroup proposed, whether it went through discussion or 
not, for a few weeks. Deciding not to risk it, I decided to put a.f.s-h 
on hold until it blew over. (It wasn't until sometime in February I 
started it back up again, after bowing out in mid-December of last year...)
Thinking I had failed to get support (the opposite was true), Erich 
Schulman (sp?), et al, started work on the mailing list. Just the fact I 
put a.f.s-h on hold, because I did not want it tagged as "bogus" (which 
anything created by "Tom Servo" would have been automaticly been tagged 
as), I'm partly responsible for this mailing list's creation. Both have 
the same goals, but the mailing list has been more successful than the 
newsgroup, which saddens me. :(

Quozl... I enjoy all sorts of Sonic Stories... even those that don't mesh
with any sort of 'set sonic universe'.  I'd be interested in seeing that 
story(s) with Bunny.

=======================
Sonic This -- Sonic #31
=======================

Archie Comic's Sonic #31 was at my local comic shop not long ago.  In the
main story "A Robot Rides the Rails" we see the return of Geoffery St. 
John as the freedom fighters battle Robotnik's latest robotic menace.  Two
other stories include a 2-page teaser for a Knuckles Solo Story ("Lost...
and Found").  We also have the start of a solo story featuring ROTOR! 
Yup!  You heard right.  It's titled "Tundra Road". 

-- Story -- 
I don't like to spoil stories for people so I'll just say that Sonic
definitly has some competition when it comes to trying to wind the hand of
Princess Sally.  Sonic thinks Sally is just trying to get him jealous and
vows "Two can play at that game!".

Hrmmm..  Maybe he's gonna start going out with Amy Rose (she seems a bit
young for Sonic though... especially as she was portrayed before).  Bunnie
doesn't seem like Sonic's type (more like Rotor's type if you ask me). 
Who's left [Penelope the Platypus from Freedom Fighters: The Next
Generation (My term for those new guys introduced in the Sally Miniseries)
(I think that's her name.. I'm doing this from memory [I also have too 
many nested parentheses... as usual])]

-- Art -- 
Hrm... I can't quite put my finger on what I find 'wrong' with the way the
main story is drawn (inking, penciling, even coloring?).  Emotions and
facial expressions don't seem to mesh, the characters at times look too
stiff, Tails' tails are doing the splits, proportions don't seem right. 
Sonic is the best-drawn here.  Maybe I'm just being too picky. 

The artwork in Rotor's story is the best in this issue.

-- Letters and News in Sonic Grams --
Knuckles Miniseries delayed until April '96 (Spaz and Harvo will be 
drawing it Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders will be writing it) but
Knuckles Solo stories will continue in 'Sonic' proper.  The story in
#34 will lead to his own mini-series.

Super Sonic vs. Hyper Knuckles 48-Page Special... No news other than it
is being worked on.

In the letters, Peter Draper asks how Dylan's name is pronounced 
[ It's apparently "DILL-an" ].
 
I still want to know if Dylan is a hedgehog or a porcupine
(and if he's a hedgehog (which he kinda looks more like) why does he look
so different from Sonic, Amy Rose, and Uncle Chuck?). 

Peter also asks if the voice Knuckle's hears in "First Contact" is his 
dad's.  [ 'Close' but apparently not ]

By the way... Anyone on this list ever get a letter published in 
Sonic-Grams?

========================
Sonic That -- Sonic Book
========================

I saw a new Sonic book.  Arrg.. I forget the author and publisher but it
is one of those kids books with the buttons along the side which make 
assorted annoying noises.  I noticed the Sally button has her laughing.

====================================
Sonic The Other Thing -- Sonic Games
====================================

Yes, I know this list isn't about the games but at least I waited until I
had something else to say as well...  I also put this section last in 
case people got bored with the rest of my letter and hit the 'Next' button)

I just noticed that the Game Gear has about 5 Sonic-Based titles
(including a new Tails game) which the Genesis (known as the Mega System
outside the USA... so I'm told) doesn't have.  Whaaa!  I can't afford a
Game Gear (and at this point, something better will probably come out
soon).  The Sonic Labarynth one looks interesting though. 

Also... Not long ago I drew up sphere-for-sphere maps of all fourteen
'run-around-the-globe-getting-blue-spheres' bonus levels found in Sonic 3
and Sonic & Knuckles (lotta pausing, lotta patience, lotta colored dots on
graph paper)...  If there's any interest I might draw em up on a computer
and makes GIFs or PNGs out of them.  

Jeez!  "Mega System"?  What a horrid name.
