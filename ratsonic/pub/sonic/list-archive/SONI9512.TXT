Most StH fans are in the Sonic mailing list, it seems. Also, I'm on the

the removal of fan art from the main StH FTP/WWW site, even though the

appropriate laws. I would honestly like to be encouraged to stay in Sonic 
fandom, but right now, Sega's actions have left me very DIScouraged. :( I 
even had plans of writing a tastefully naughty Bunnie story (which I've 
developed already, and takes place 10 years after "Doomsday", but is very 
different from the other 10-years-after StH stories that have been done- 
It would put the StH universe in a primarily positive light), but because 
of circumstances, I'm ready to kill the project. :( I'd honestly like to 
be encouraged to write my tale, and I'd encourage anyone to encourage me

Currently, my dealings WRT the WB end of the fanworks fiasco is taking up 
much of my resources, that for the time being, I can't fight Sega right 
now, but I will say this to Sega: Keep an eye on what is about to unfold 
between WB Animation and WB fans- Preliminary talks may be paving the way 
for studio-approved fanworks distribution on the net that DOES include 
the "naughty" bits. I cannot say much more than that right now, and won't 
until an approved system is set up, which may be a couple months...

All I'll say is that there ARE copyright and trademark laws and court 
rulings that allow precedent for toon erotica, which Sega's actions 
against rat.org violate.

In the meantime, would anyone mind encouraging a fellow StH fan 
(especially a Bunnie fan) to stay?

I'm sure _somebody_ will, but it won't be me... (not meant as a flame, but 
I can't honesly put a smiley in there either...)

Note to fan-fic authors (nobody in particular though): if your story 
contains sex, violence, or other possibly disturbing stuff, I suggest you 
note that prominently at the beginning of it.  I could handle the grimness 
of the show itself, but much of the fan-fic fic has gone an order of 
magnitude beyond that, and it's too much for me.

In fact, since I haven't read much of the fan-fic that's been sent to the 
list (I've stuck it in a "to read" directory, but don't know when I'll get to 
it), would some volunteer out there like to summarize all the fan-fic done 
so far in terms of plot and a rating re. violence/sex/whatever?

No argument with the former, but (at the risk of trying to grab 
credit/glory, which I don't mean to do) I sort of thought _I_ had something 
to do with the latter; I started (and still have) a mini-mailing list over 
a year ago and Erich (and others?) took the idea and made it a _real_ list.

Answer:  In "Doomsday," Princess Sally and Sonic used the Deep Power Stones
in what I call "Power Ring" mode, as opposed to "Bomb" mode, as was planned
by them.  The juice in those rocks went through Sal like a power ring goes
through Sonic, which gives her that power.  She is later juicing hand-in-hand

I would have to agree with Ron here, and had been planning the very 
thought of just such a disclaimer. (My planned story, as yet no title, 
was planned as a romance at a time when what was left of Mobius was being 
rebuilt...)

I guess that even under the most dire of circumstances, I believe in 
hope, which is why I really liked the SatAM (now SunAM) StH, because it 
*was* a positive theme within a grim world...

That is a very good idea, though I'd have to say Bookshire's WWW story 
page does just that!

I guess you don't know what did lead to the creation of the Sonic list 
then. For the record, I'll explain:

During the time I was proposing a.f.s-h in alt.config, a teenager going 
by the handle "Tom Servo", who was already notorious for bogus newsgroup 
creations, decided to proclain (and then proceeded to) that he will 
create every newsgroup proposed, whether it went through discussion or 
not, for a few weeks. Deciding not to risk it, I decided to put a.f.s-h 
on hold until it blew over. (It wasn't until sometime in February I 
started it back up again, after bowing out in mid-December of last year...)
Thinking I had failed to get support (the opposite was true), Erich 
Schulman (sp?), et al, started work on the mailing list. Just the fact I 
put a.f.s-h on hold, because I did not want it tagged as "bogus" (which 
anything created by "Tom Servo" would have been automaticly been tagged 
as), I'm partly responsible for this mailing list's creation. Both have 
the same goals, but the mailing list has been more successful than the 
newsgroup, which saddens me. :(

Subject: Sonic This, Sonic That, Sonic The Other Thing
Status: O
X-Status: 

Quozl... I enjoy all sorts of Sonic Stories... even those that don't mesh
with any sort of 'set sonic universe'.  I'd be interested in seeing that 
story(s) with Bunny.

=======================
Sonic This -- Sonic #31
=======================

Archie Comic's Sonic #31 was at my local comic shop not long ago.  In the
main story "A Robot Rides the Rails" we see the return of Geoffery St. 
John as the freedom fighters battle Robotnik's latest robotic menace.  Two
other stories include a 2-page teaser for a Knuckles Solo Story ("Lost...
and Found").  We also have the start of a solo story featuring ROTOR! 
Yup!  You heard right.  It's titled "Tundra Road". 

-- Story -- 
I don't like to spoil stories for people so I'll just say that Sonic
definitly has some competition when it comes to trying to wind the hand of
Princess Sally.  Sonic thinks Sally is just trying to get him jealous and
vows "Two can play at that game!".

Hrmmm..  Maybe he's gonna start going out with Amy Rose (she seems a bit
young for Sonic though... especially as she was portrayed before).  Bunnie
doesn't seem like Sonic's type (more like Rotor's type if you ask me). 
Who's left [Penelope the Platypus from Freedom Fighters: The Next
Generation (My term for those new guys introduced in the Sally Miniseries)
(I think that's her name.. I'm doing this from memory [I also have too 
many nested parentheses... as usual])]

-- Art -- 
Hrm... I can't quite put my finger on what I find 'wrong' with the way the
main story is drawn (inking, penciling, even coloring?).  Emotions and
facial expressions don't seem to mesh, the characters at times look too
stiff, Tails' tails are doing the splits, proportions don't seem right. 
Sonic is the best-drawn here.  Maybe I'm just being too picky. 

The artwork in Rotor's story is the best in this issue.

-- Letters and News in Sonic Grams --
Knuckles Miniseries delayed until April '96 (Spaz and Harvo will be 
drawing it Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders will be writing it) but
Knuckles Solo stories will continue in 'Sonic' proper.  The story in
#34 will lead to his own mini-series.

Super Sonic vs. Hyper Knuckles 48-Page Special... No news other than it
is being worked on.

In the letters, Peter Draper asks how Dylan's name is pronounced 
[ It's apparently "DILL-an" ].
 
I still want to know if Dylan is a hedgehog or a porcupine
(and if he's a hedgehog (which he kinda looks more like) why does he look
so different from Sonic, Amy Rose, and Uncle Chuck?). 

Peter also asks if the voice Knuckle's hears in "First Contact" is his 
dad's.  [ 'Close' but apparently not ]

By the way... Anyone on this list ever get a letter published in 
Sonic-Grams?

========================
Sonic That -- Sonic Book
========================

I saw a new Sonic book.  Arrg.. I forget the author and publisher but it
is one of those kids books with the buttons along the side which make 
assorted annoying noises.  I noticed the Sally button has her laughing.

====================================
Sonic The Other Thing -- Sonic Games
====================================

Yes, I know this list isn't about the games but at least I waited until I
had something else to say as well...  I also put this section last in 
case people got bored with the rest of my letter and hit the 'Next' button)

I just noticed that the Game Gear has about 5 Sonic-Based titles
(including a new Tails game) which the Genesis (known as the Mega System
outside the USA... so I'm told) doesn't have.  Whaaa!  I can't afford a
Game Gear (and at this point, something better will probably come out
soon).  The Sonic Labarynth one looks interesting though. 

Also... Not long ago I drew up sphere-for-sphere maps of all fourteen
'run-around-the-globe-getting-blue-spheres' bonus levels found in Sonic 3
and Sonic & Knuckles (lotta pausing, lotta patience, lotta colored dots on
graph paper)...  If there's any interest I might draw em up on a computer
and makes GIFs or PNGs out of them.  

Jeez!  "Mega System"?  What a horrid name.

Only one person, as far as I know of:  Alessandro Sanasi.  I don't recall 
the issue number, but I think it was 19 or 20.  I did send e-mail to 
Archie last month with a suggestion about the packaging of subscription 
copies, and I told them they could publish it if they wanted to.

Sorry, Dave, but I've never gotten into the whole X-thing.

No, Uncle Chuck doesn't die, but he does witness the collapse of
Mobotropolis just before...hey, I'm not GIVING this stuff away!

Haven't thought of crossovers to BAM or anything else -- I'm noodling
this out simply as a way of tying up ALL the loose ends.  No metal, but

So Robotnik destroys a perfectly good robotocizer.  Your point being...?  I

Subject: A note WRT the copyright & trademark issues & Sega....

As some of you may be aware from my previous post, I founded Fans Against 
Legal Harassment to fight for our (fans') rights as allowed under the 
appropriate laws (namely the U.S. Copyright Laws), and various U.S. 
Supreme Court and 1st Circuit U.S. Federal Court rulings covering 
copyrights, fanworks, and their use in non-commercial (*and* commercial) 
works, which establishes precedent in the fabs' favour over such use, 
including the more pornographic works.

I'm too tired right now to go into great detail, but I will offer this: 
if you would like to know exactly what laws and rulings apply, contack 
FALH's legal representative, Aaron Varhola at avarhola@ix.netcom.com, and 
he'll fill you in.

Suffice it to say, actions taken by Sega this past month puts *them* in 
the wrong, not the fan artists/writers, nor the site administrators.

Also: thanks for the kind words sent my way- It helps some. :)

Also #2: for those unaware, I'm NOT on this mailing list- Erich Schulman 
is forwarding this to you for me, as I only read the list on a 
once-a-month basis, via the archives.

It's time for the Freedom Fighters to act! :)

Not exactly. Did any of the sites include any of the U.S. Supreme Court 
rulings relevant to the issues? Probably not, but nevertheless, I would 
look into the 1994 Campbell v. Rose-Acuff case. Rose-Acuff (Roy Orbison's 
publishing co.) tried to make a similar case WRT 2 Live Crew's rather 
raunchy parody (which was unauthorised) of "Oh, Pretty Woman", of which 
the Supreme Court ruled in 2 Live Crew's favour, which *allows* works 
derived from existing copyrighted material, regardless of pruriant 
content, under "Parody".

Whereas works that are parodied or satirised retain their copyrights, 
these works are also protected by copyright in their own right, separate 
from the source copyrights. The rights of the final work supersede that 
of the source work, but do not negate the source work, as long as the 
final work is original, and not a direct alteration of an existing work. 
(IOW, it's perfectly legal to draw your own fan art, but not to "draw 
mustaches" on someone else's work. :) )


> SEGA believed the porn pics were bad for marketing.

Whether it made them look good or not is legally irrelevant. (The 
Campbell case.)

The only legal recourse would be with trademarks, but even that wouldn't 
work, as trademark protection only works on a commercial level, and even 
that is rather limited... (The L.L.Bean case, 1st Circuit Court...)

Sega has the RIGHT to voice objection, but legally, that's about it.

Nope, they didn't. THAT right belongs to the owners of the final works, 
which in this case, artist Bill Fortier, who has been served with a 
Cease-and-Desist letter from WB (even though he stopped doing toons last 
March), has asked that any pics of his be removed. I complied with that.

I'm not a lawyer- Not even a law student. Nevertheless I've been involved 
in copyright issues at one level or another for 17 years, ever since I 
was on the junior high newspaper back in the late 70's. As a fan writer, 
I have to know my rights to make sure I don't get into trouble.

If you want further clarification- AND QUOTES- Contact my lawyer friend, 
Aaron Varhola (yes, a REAL lawyer) at avarhola@ix.netcom.com... He and I 
essentially run Fans Against Legal Harassment, which was set up to 
counter actions by a much larger company than Sega, ie: WB, and it looks 
like we're winning: WB wants a truce- We're just working on how it'll 
work... :) We're not rich in monetary resources, but we more than make up 
for it with brain and will power, and not a little bit of solidarity from 
fellow outraged fans... :)

Actions taken by FALH are being noticed by the media.

Yeah, but who said Sal's going to know that?  Lindsay's story demonstrated
perfectly well that Sally might jump to the wrong conclusion, and who says
there can't be a plot-hole where it's suddenly forgotten that they met in
issue 25?

THAT'S an idea.  Someone came up with an idea CLOSE to that (only involving
a 3rd-party character rather than Bunnie) in the Prodigy Sonic Club before
time began (a year and a half ago, before I joined the club, even), but the
only reply she got was from some perv.  I made a new twist on the story
last Valentine's Day, but my Valentine's Day story wasn't exactly one to be
taken seriously (it was tied in second place for ridiculousness with Jaded
Views, first place being my April Fools' special, which is saying a lot
since all my holiday specials were insane to the point where I never put
'em on the Net).  Anyhoo, it'd be nice to see a version that's ALMOST to be
taken seriously (I don't see how it could be fully so, since I find it very
hard to take anything involving furries in love triangles seriously)...hmmmmmm...

X-Status: 

I just finished reading it.  I swear, it was the most hilarious Sonic story
I've ever read (come to think of it, though, the only other Sonic stories
I've ever read that were meant to be humorous were my own...).

Anyway, I talked to my friend Steve "Maxl" Tramer (co-author of Jaded
Views) and I mentioned that story to him, and he said to get him a
printout.  So after I printed that and was waiting for Blue Flames to print
(little knowing that when I came back two hours later I'd discover there
had been a printing problem, and think that the almost-empty magenta
cartridge was at fault, when really it was the paper, and then get my hand
covered in magenta ink), I read the story aloud to my younger brother,
Hannibal.   Both of us thought Simon must have been spying on our house,
because he was right on just about all counts (except for the fact that
Hannibal's the Doom fanatic, not me).

Anyway, I'd like to say thanx a whole bunch for making me such a hero, and
for generally producing a story in a genre where there are very few Sonic
stories, and for showing that you weren't meaning to flame when you
compared one of your stories to some others by showing just about
everything that I thought you were insulting.  Anyhoo, keep those comedy
stories coming if you can, and I'm sure Maxl will pardon the fingers you
seemed to be pointing at the story we wrote, since Mobian GPF seemed
exactly like something he would write (although he's not that PC-literate;
he only knows of what a pain Macs are).




Anyway, thanks again, and I hope Bookshire puts this up on his page soon!

It's Anne Jordan. And do it!! That would be hilarious! :-)

Of course she might be a puppet and it might not be her decision, but she's

It all started on a sunny American day, junior like normal was using his

Autodesk(R) Animator-Pro(TM) to remove the clothing, or add external organs
to pictures. His poor dear mother didn't even know why she kept having to
get her harddrive upgraded, nor why the computer store repairman looked at
her funny after returning her machine. Junior did, for he had power of the
.GIF(R), and he could use the allmighty "File Manager" (TM).

The problem he had now was that humans were just so boring, always the same
thing, the same way, the same crude jokes. What he wanted was something more
primitive, even slightly savage, perhaps animal like. Animals, furry little
animals, yes.. he liked that. He'd even found himself staring at a
Care-Bear(TM) plushie oddly before.
He typed the word in, however to his
dismay, the Internet link just held there. Apparently someone in the world
was using his 65535 modems to search for everything beginning with "A."

The kid pulled out a small box that was connected to the back of his computer,
it had three buttons on, "UP" "DOWN" and "TERM." It was also outkitted with
a Liquid Crystal Display. He pushed up, and the machine powered to life,
displaying the first entry on the display.

<ABLATER@LIN01.GLOBAL.CO.ZA>

"CO.ZA" he wondered to himself, well, he didn't know where it was... but it
couldn't have been very near, he pushed the "TERM" button. Inside the
little chip of the modem, an escape string originated. It passed through
the fibre-optic phone lines down to the main internet server. A single line
of code passed the escape string to the next server, to the next, and finally
through an undersea cable. It reached it's destination, and the 14.4 modem
belonging to Simon decoded it.

The device that looked like the coil exploded violently, it was in
fact filled with plastique explosive.

Junior smiled, some fool somewhere in the world had been taken care off. He
liked that, less people on the net. How dare they waste *HIS* time, didn't
they know he drove a pentium? How dare they? The answer was simple, they
didn't.. at least not any more.

The screen filled with text, he awaited the news, heart pounding lusting it's
sick desire. But as the blue words "Search Again" came up, he shuddered.
Now he needed something else.. but what? What else was furry, cute, cuddly
and capable of fulfilling his evil little cravings?

Standing up he went for a drink, as he entered the kitchen to fizz up some
water for a nice cool glass of Energade(TM), he noticed that on the worktop
part of an open comic protruded from underneath a magazine. It was his little
sisters, suddenly his heart froze .. he saw the words.
"CHECK OUT: Princess Sally in a hot pink string Bikini."

He looked around, then dived at the comic. From cartoons he'd lazily let
go by, he remembered who she was, a ground squirrel. He could imagine her
soft fur and shapely figure as he pulled it up to his face.

But alas, for imagine was all he could do. The picture showed the princess
cutting tapes, teasing him. "I don't think so!" He held the magazine there
for a moment, examining her supple figure, the soft rounded blue boots she
wore, and her tempting pricking ears. A drop of saliva saturated the cheap
paper; he frantically wiped it away.. now this was excitement!

He dived back at the machine, this time he would fulfill his lust. Search
for "Princess Sally" he typed.

Nothing.

Okay, then search for "Sally."

Sally Dineens Dinosaur page/Sally Shears cheat for Warcraft(TM)/ Sally at
college.

He screamed. Slamming the screen, now what in the hell cartoon did she
come on? What was it's name? As he remembered it was something that his mom
had once cursed, saying that she'd be glad when the fad moved over to the
echidna. Whatever an echidna was. Wasn't it some speedy character, no.. Jass
didn't have his own cartoon yet.. it was.. oh.. That's it Sonic.. Sonic the
Warthog!

He searched in full, but got no results.. so he searched for "Sonic" alone,
and was surprised to see the character was actually a hedgehog. He clicked a
blueish icon, and came up on "Bookshire's Page."(TM)

All he had to do now was find a picture, he looked over the options. Two
struck him, normal and mature. The boy felt odd again, mature material,
he clicked on it.. ignoring the legalities text.

Soon he was enjoying a whole range of pictures--after suffering a
dissapointment that there were no stories. But something upset him, as of yet
he hadn't seen any pictures of the squirrel, just a few of some stupid
rabbit. She excited him too though, metal.. ooh how he would love to swap
places with the hedgehog she was serving. He flipped on, two pictures of
the squirrel posing excited him, he saved them into yet another directory,
then continued. Finally he came to one picture.. it was the hedgehog and the
squirrel. His mouth dropped in awe, the keyboard became saturated in slime.
He stuck there for minutes, deeply entranced by 640X480 collection of pixels.

"Oh Junior, my little echidna!" rang out mommies voice as she walked into
the room carrying a Knuckles(TM) plushie she had brought him. The lady stopped
as she saw the screen.

This.. this.. was intolerable! The air became musty around her, she could do
nothing, just choke. In a final move she slapped the still stunned boy around
the back of the head, before passing out.

The words "THIS IS WAR!" went through her mind as the world darkened.

I've run into the same problem myself: more fanfic than there is time to
get through it.  Actually, I'd take it upon myself to review fanfic
except that I suffer from a work-related condition: I'm an editor by
trade and I cannot resist the impulse to read fanfic without a red or
blue pencil nearby.  It's very hard to read the stories without the
notion of rewriting them somewhere in the back of my mind.  BTW, I edit
a periodical index, so it's probably more accurate to call me an
indexer, but the job involved editorial judgments as well.

There exists a newsgroup called alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.  It was created 
several months ago, and is a low-volume group.  That newsgroup and this 
mailing list have little to do with each other beyond discussions of Sonic.

The a.f.s-h newsgroup does not seem to be widely distributed.  I haven't 
polled list subscribers lately, but earlier this year, quite a few did 
not have access to it.  This includes some without access to alt.* groups 
and some without access to any Usenet groups at all (eg, a mail-only 
account on a BBS).

I do have access to that newsgroup on Nyx, but that is a very slow 
account (but free, so I'm not really complaining) and news articles 
expire rapidly, sometimes <24 hours.

As this list appears to be considered competition to the newsgroup, it is 
only very seldom that I use the newsgroup to recruit list subscribers.  
Those who use both the list and the newsgroup can confirm my infrequency 
of posting thereto.

In 20/20 hindsight, I should have archived some of the postings in groups 
like rec.arts.animation with regard to the late 1994 proposal of the 
formation of a.f.s-h.  There were posts indicating both adequate and 
inadequate interest levels in the Usenet community for the proposed 
creation of the newsgroup.

To ensure due credit is given, this list's history can indeed be traced 
to Ron Bauerle and his "mini-list" to which I was added in late 1994 and 
in which I had suggested an upgrade in status to that of a regular 
mailing list.  (That mini-list continues to exist, albeit with the 
complication of this list's anti-spam measures which causes the mini-list 
users' posts to this list to be forwarded by me.)

It was my original intention to run this list off my Delphi account.  The 
debut of this list would have been delayed for some time while I wrote 
companion software.  Even a few months ago, I was shuddering at the 
thought of still running this list off Delphi.  Though I do know of one 
mailing list actually being run from a Delphi account, it is extremely 
low volume; I would consider this list to be in the low- to medium-volume 
tier.

In late January 1995, Ratman offered use of his site and majordomo for 
starting this list.  Realizing the advantages of using majordomo as 
opposed to writing and debugging my own software to use with Delphi, I 
was happy to accept.  The Sonic list changed servers several times during 
the setup, and tests were made.  I reckon opening day to 04 February 
1995, though the list was ready the night before.  I announced the 
opening of the list to rec.arts.animation on the 4th, and the first post 
to the list was made (see the archives).

Since then, we've added a digest format for the list and initiated 
protection against spam after the list's first and only hit in July 
1995.  Several more attempts to spam the list were thus blocked.  (The 
ftp and Web sites were added as well, but they are not part of the list 
itself.  Longtime subscribers may remember that a number of files besides 
the archives were available through majordomo, and are now ftp'able.)

I hear you there.  I go on-line on two sites:  America On-Line, and the

I also have a problem with Art Mawhinney's work. Now, don't get me wrong- 
he does a good job on Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, and even Robotnik. But there 
is one character that he just cannot do right (IMHO) - Tails. His head 
and face look slightly bigger than scale, his body is smaller, and his 
tails definately doesn't look right, especially while in flight. As far 
as someone who can draw Tails, my votes go to (in no particular order) 
Dave Manak, Pat Spaz, and even the great Scott Shaw. 
	I was so pleased to find out Dave Manak was in charge of the 
Tails miniseries. For Pat Spaz - I don't think he can draw anyone wrong, 
especially Sally [right, guys (issue #25, Sally on the bi-plane - 
SHWING!)]. To date, the last example of Scott Shaw's work was "Tails' 
Tallest Tale", from the Sonic & Knuckles issue. I still wonder if he will 
return. Hell, I think we all do.

I just got mine in the mail today. The first story, except for the fact 
that it features Mr. St. John, the artwork is a major disapointment. :-(

Knuckles' Chaotix #1 [n/d]
     "The Chaos Effect" (three parts)
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders; Art: Art Mawhinney
     After a nice one-page splash of Knuckles on the floating
island, we move on to the plot.  All the freedom fighters on
Mobius, it seems, have been invited to attend some sort of
amusement part on the island (which begs two important questions:
How did they get their invites?, and How did they get to the
island?).  The host, Renfield T. Rodent, escorts Sonic and the
Knothole gang into the hall of mirrors which is, of course, a
trap: everyone is sucked into an alternate dimension through the
mirrors except for Knuckles, and his abilities have been
compromised.  Three guesses who's behind it all, and the first
two don't count.
     Part 2 is basically an introduction to the Chaotix -- the
collective name for the 32-X game characters: Charmy Bee, Espio
Chameleon, Vector Crocodile, Mighty Armadillo, and the robots
Heavy and Bomb.  Perhaps the look was dictated by the game, but
Charmy, Espio and Mighty look way too much like Sonic wearing a
costume.  Anyway, armed with a cache of power gems, they prepare
to do battle.
     After starting all the amusement park rides at once to get
Robotnik's attention, the Chaotix find themselves up against
Mecha-Sonic.  Mecha-Sonic attempts to morph into a giant Hyper-
Knuckles, but the real Knuckles uses a power gem to even the odds.
In the ensuing clash of the titans, the mirrors in the Hall are
smashed and the freedom fighters released.  Robotnik makes his
escape, leaving Renfield to be arrested by some Muppets (I'm
sorry, but that's what they look like!).  Knuckles and the
Chaotix decline an offer to join the freedom fighters.

     Story: Ken Penders; Art: Harvo
     The members of the Chaotix play tag for 5 pages.  That's it.
Except for the appearance of some mysterious insect on the last
page, that's all there is to the plot!  If I were a tree, I'd be
insulted at being chopped down and pulped to yield the paper for
this!

Sonic #31  [Feb 1996]
     "A Robot Rides The Rails" (3 parts)
     Story and Art: Ken Penders
     This is Ken Penders' debut at drawing the Sonic characters,
and some fans have complained about the artwork, especially in
terms of modeling and facial expressions.  Still, Penders ends up
taking the reader on a pretty wild ride....
     Sally jumps a moving train carrying a Dynamac 3000,
Robotnik's latest creation.  On board, who should she run into
but Geoffrey St. John, who with some other commandos are
attempting to intercept Dynamac.  Their attempt to stop the
train, however, only awakens Dynamac.  Sonic is airlifted to the
train in time to witness Dynamac begin morphing.  Nicole informs
the group that Dynamac can adapt and react to attacks but cannot
anticipate; she also reveals how Dynamac can be deactivated.  It
takes a bit of doing, including Rotor flying interference in a
jet aircraft, but Dynamac gets blasted.  Sonic is none too
pleased with Geoffrey's farewell to Sally, and considers playing
the jealousy card himself.
     Whatever faults Penders may have as an artist (and these
could be smoothed out with practice), he's written a fairly
gripping action yarn, though in some ways it feels wrong.  More
suited to James Bond than Sonic the Hedgehog.  And Nicole's
"personality" is going off in a wrong direction as well.  Still,
an entertaining effort.
     "Lost and Found: Part 1"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Ken Penders
     This is supposed to be the beginning of the sequel to "The
Hunt Is On" from the Chaotix special.  It goes on for 2 pages. 
TWO LOUSY PAGES!  Except for a dropped clue [the words "Grand
Conserve"], this may as well have been an ad for the real
beginning of "Lost and Found" in Sonic #32!  What a waste!
     "Tundra Road: Part 1"
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Art Mawhinney
     Responding to a call for help from his mother(!!), Rotor
pilots his bathysphere (which looks like a submarine to me!) to
the Frozen North Sea [good thing he didn't think to ask Tails for
the use of the Sea Fox, since it was scuttled in Tails #1].  The
inclusion of an "audience participation" maze in one panel is a
dead giveaway that this story is being pitched to the rugrat
readership.  Rotor arrives home to find his Mom and little
brother Skeeter acting like zombies.  They and every other walrus
on the ice floe (why am I reminded of all those Far Side cartoons
that featured look-alike penguins?) proceed into an ice cave to
watch Robotnik on a big screen TV.  The Big Guy has abandoned his
plan to melt the polar caps, opting instead for a plan to freeze
all life on Mobius.  Rotor, not having been affected by a "neuron
bomb" that made the walrus herd susceptible to Robotnik's
broadcasts, tries to escape but is hit with a club by a SWATbot
and falls into the sea.  To be continued.
     Sonic-Grams: Dawn Spaziante, Pat's sister, is working at
Archie and puts in an appearance in the office humor section. 
Hey, Scott, I'm from Chicago -- you don't have to explain
nepotism to me!  Major news: Spaziante and Harvo will be tackling
a Knuckles miniseries, with story by Kanterovich and Penders.  In
order to accomodate them, the roll-out of the miniseries has been
delayed until April '96.  Isn't this kinda like what happened to
the Princess Sally miniseries?  Like Leo Durocher said, it's
*deja vu* all over again!  Two of the three letters concern
themselves with game matters; in response to the other, Sonic
only goes as far as admitting that he's "in like" with Sally, and
states that the guess that Archimedes is Knuckles' father is
"real close!"  Cute portrait of Sally on that page, BTW.

Which surprisingly doesn't emit any smoke; for being a pollution lover, 
you'd think Robotnik wouldn't use anything that clean :^)  (And before you 
say "it was an _electric_ train", what about that "chug-chug-chugga-chugga" 
sound effect on page 1?)

Also, I thought Mobius was sufficiently advanced enough to not need things 
like trains (ironic that _I_ should say this, since I work for a company 
that makes locomotives...)

>     Whatever faults Penders may have as an artist (and these

My main complaint (and this is going to sound more insulting than I mean it 
to be :^)) is that sometimes Sally's mouth was a bit lop-sided - the 
nearest comparison I can think of is Kennedy Studio's animation of Tiny 
Toons, but it wasn't _that_ bad :^)

I wonder how long before they find out that the quickest way through most 
mazes is to just hug the right hand wall and zip through it (I read once 
that some student robot builders won a contest that way - instead of 
dumping time and $$ into intelligence, they went for speed (hmm, sort of 
like Sonic?  :^))

>Rotor arrives home to find his Mom and little brother Skeeter acting like

I didn't see much "civilization" on that ice-floe - wonder what kind of 
society the walrusses on Mobius have?

Which reminds me: Hey, Paul Castiglia!  Is she as cute in person as in the

a boyfriend?  Enquiring minds want to know :^)

just great music! Oh ya, there's a "way cool" poem/speech effort in there too.

Hope ya all enjoy.

Here question is kind of related - In the Princess Sally cruisade episode, 
from the Sonic In Your Face issue, towards the end in the flashforward 
part, Sonic and Sally apparently had two kids. The boy looked 100% 
hedgehog and the girl looked 100% squirrel, except for the fact that she 
could run as fast as her brother. How could this be possible? Is there a 
genetic thing on Mobius where species of a child is related to the 
species and sex of the parent? (Example above.)

message is GOOD.

                  Symon Kielb bsc4034@dcs.napier.ac.uk

'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...
How to live in a world that's politically correct?
His workers no longer would answer to "Elves".
"Vertically Challenged" they were calling themselves.
And labor conditions at the north pole
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.

Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.
And equal employment had made it quite clear
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.
So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!

The runners had been removed from his sleigh;
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.
And people had started to call for the cops
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.
Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.
His fur trimmed red suit was called "Unenlightened."

And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose
And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.

So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,
Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,
Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.

And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.
Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.
Nothing that might be construed to pollute.
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.
Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.
Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.
Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.

No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.
And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.
For they raised the hackles of those psychological
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.

No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.
Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.

So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;
He just could not figure out what to do next.
He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,
But you've got to be careful with that word today.
His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.

Something special was needed, a gift that he might
Give to all without angering the left or the right.
A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,
Each group of people, every religion;
Every ethnicity, every hue,
Everyone, everywhere...even you.
So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...
"May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth."

I'm no geneticist, but if interspecies couplings are accepted practice
on Mobius, might the species be genetically linked with the gender?
Everything else would be "negotiable."  Otherwise, there would tend to
be a blurring of the species over time, with a loss of definite
characteristics.  Thus, Mobians would slowly creep toward one homogeneous
species rather than diversifying -- that's one in the eye for Darwin!

No, but there have been variations on the theme in the (US) Archie
comics.  In "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter" (Sonic #23, June 1995),
Robotnik, Snively, Sonic, Sally, Rotor and Tails are all captured by a
giant alien who wants to study them.  Of course, Robotnik blows the
alien (and Sonic) out of an airlock at the first opportunity but Rotor
retrives them both.  Lately, in "The Return of Uncle Chuck" (#30),
Robotnik is rescued from the Void on condition that he not harm Sonic et
al.  I could never write such a story myself: too much has been invested
in Robotnik as a villain to come up with something so much worse that
even a temporary alliance would be in order.

John:

I was updating the thing on my own, but started receiving complaints
that the thing had ballooned out of proportion -- apparently, some
systems can't handle very large files, which is what the FAQ has become.
So I've taken to posting synopses of the comics as they appear (in the
absence of any other media), hoping that Ratman will cut and paste the
entries into a unified FAQ File (hint! hint!).  Actually, Nov 15 is
really rather up-to-date ... unless you meant Nov 15, 1994!

Long ago I read someone's explanation of 'cartoon genetics' (it may have
even been from Quozl)...  I don't remember it fully but if this isn't the
same just think of it as 'my' hokey explanation:

[[ Warning -- this explanation assumes you've had freshman biology. ]]

The key is to treat 'species' as just a trait... with the special property
that resessive 'species genes' are 'gender-linked'  (( WARNING!  This is NOT 
true in real biology ))

Okay... Lets assume Sally's mother, being a squirrel, has a genotype of
  Ss   ( Capital 'S' meaning Dominant Squirrel Gene )
       ( Lowercase 's' meaning resessive 'gender-linked' squirrel gene )

King Acorn, being a fox, might have a genotype of:
  Ff   ( 'F' and 'f' meaning dominant and resessive 'fox' genes )

There would be 4 possible genotypes for their offspring (i.e. mix one gene
from the mother and one from the father):

  Sf  Fs  sf  SF

The results of each would be:
  Sf     Dominant 'S' gene means offspring is a Squirrel
  Fs     Dominant 'F' gene means offspring is a Fox
  sf     No dominant gene... species is now 'gender-linked' thus if the
         offspring were male, he would be a Fox like King Acorn and if
         the offspring were female, she would be a squirrel.
  SF     Both Dominant genes mean offspring would be a 'Squirrel-Fox'
         combination (e.g  Fox with Squirrel tail)

Since on Mobius we don't see any of these combinations we might be able to
claim the dominant genes were 'gender-linked' too thus a genotype of
SF would be just like sf... Squirrel if female, Fox if male.

I could go on and talk about possible genotypes for Sonic's and Sally's
families (and offspring?) but I'll leave it as a 'reader exercise'...
besides, we don't know enough of their family trees in order to make any
real good guesses.

If you play around with this system you see that the species never turn
into a 'homogeneous mass' and you can sometimes get weird results:

e.g. Fox with genotype 'Fr' and Squirrel with genotype 'Sr' could produce
     a Raccoon with genotype 'rr'.

--

Oh.. In other news... I found  Tails #3  at my local comic shop yesterday.
Overall, the story wasn't as good as the Sally miniseries but it definitly
got better near the end.  We're also given a 'taste' of what's to come in
the Knuckles stories of Sonic 32-34.  (By the way... Muttski returns in 
Sonic 32).

Okay, someone want to put this in a FAQ file? (DNA uhh Dan)

It all has to do with DNA, DNA as the encyclopedia says is a three
dimensional macro-molecule, and it's the largest molecule known to man.
Linked into helix's by hydrogen bonds, the "deoxyribonucleic acid' contains
atomic programming which controls all the features of the lifeform,
including cellular operation, strengths, and weaknesses. From what I can
tell DNA is a mixture of sugars, proteins and some other chemicals with
names that make them look like they wouldn't be out of place in fizzy-drink.
For example "Phosphoric acids", "Thymine", "Cytosine", "Guanine".. well you
get the idea.

Now, what does this have to do with a genus sciurus and a hedgehog mating? 

Well DNA is stored on chromosomes, okay now, the male has X and Y sex
chromosomes while the female has two X chromosones. Now let's look at the infos:
*----------------*--------------------*
|Sonic XY        |     Sally XX       |   
*----------------*--------------------*
|Hedgehog,       |  Ground Squirrel   |  
|Very Fast,      |  Very Intelligent. |    
|Blue?           |  Orange/Brown.     |  
|Large Eyes      |  Smaller Eyes      |
*----------------*--------------------*

Now looking at this, and knowing that a female will take on 2 X cells, while 
the male an X and a Y. We can come to the following conclusions.

If the child was a boy(XY) then:

There would be a (1X) + (1Y)=2  (Sonic)
                 (2XX)+ (0Y)=2  (Sally)
                               50% chance of inheriting either sides
characteristics.
  
While if the child was a girl(XX), 
                             (1X)  = 1 (Sonic)
                             (2X)  = 2 (Sally)
                               66% Chance of Taking on Sally's characteristics.
 
So generally a female will take on her more of her mothers characteristics, 
this would suggest that Sally's mother is indeed a squirrel, as her father is 
a fox.. perhaps this also gives an idea where she go her cunning from. (Dad)

I'm not scientist, just a lamer at home. I don't really get this DNA stuff.
So if anyone wants to clear it up for me. Feel free.
Well, I think it's pretty accurate though... the Squirrel girl won on a 33%
chance and got the speed, perhaps her brother on a 50% chance got the
intelligence? 

Okay, lets say *I* married a vixen. ;) Though we'll just skip the stage between 
marriage and actually having the kid. hehehe. *cringes*

*------------------------*--------------------------*
|        Si(XY)          |       Vixen Vulpy        |
*------------------------*--------------------------*
| Good Looking. ;)       |           Furry          |
| Strong        :)       |    Very Very Protective  |
| Mega Coder             |       Mega Shopper       |
| Plans to conquer Earth | Talks on the phone       |
| A little bit Crazy     | Down to Earth            |
*------------------------*--------------------------*

Box (XY): Hmm.. mix of the two, I really don't think I want an
overprotective, furry, Mega Shopper, son who's down to earth, which he plans
to conquer? Hmmm..
Nope.. won't work.

Girl (XX): Maybe she could lose the shopping, and pick up the earth conquering
stuff? Hmm.. My mind boggles, correction, it boils like brocolli. Well, I
think the dating service computer would just explode or burn out or
something in the corny style they always do in cheap cartoons if it had to
consider this.

Basically, humans and vulpines.. well don't try it at home kids! I couldn't
bear the thought of the kid that calls me daddy, having fur ALL OVER!
EYEEUW! Or having a block phongy reflective nose. Besides it's just not
humane/ vulpane, 
the other kids would laugh at him at school, and then he'd have to savage,
as in bite them.

Oh yes, while I'm at it. Nucleic acids can be changed by another molecule
that would react with it. This suggests to me that if you could get
someone's DNA sample.. you could 'build' a personalized molecule that would
change them into anything you wanted. Though the difficulties with this are
that if it is not equally spread, the body will begin fighting itself like
cancer. Perhaps we could build some nanites to invade the nucleus of a cell
and reprogram DNA... so how about it.. anyone want to join me on a quest to
turn all humanity into furries? :) Free pentiums! heheh!

We could call it the furocizer!!! Just think, all EARTH will be mine,
AHAHAH! Oh, uh, yeah, well you will be with me too. Unless perchance some
terrible 'accident' befalls you. We could test the machine out on the rest
of the planet first, that way it would be perfected, and we wouldn't well...
you know end up wasted. 

Gods! I'd live to see the look on someone's face as the glass shroud lowered
over them, and they were immerged in yellow light! Ahahah! Damn, now I'm
tooexcited to program!

I'm no genetics expert (Yet :), but if i remember my Biology, their mating
shouldn't be possible at all. Except in certain cases, different species
cannot have children. This is true at least on Earth. But, this is fiction.
We can allow a little poetic license. If inter-species mating is possible,
then it is perfectly possible to have a 100% hedgehog and a 100% squirrel.
If you do a block of Punnett's squares, you can find the probabilities of
having certain genetic traits appearing in offspring, both dominant and
recessive and nobody knows what I'm talking about so I'll shut up now..... :)

From what I can recall, you certainly have a good imagination regarding the
Sonic characters.  I suggest you mail some brief plot synopses to Sonic
editor Scott Fulop.  "Brief" is the key word.  Unfortunately, due to the
heavy work load, editors do not have the time to read detailed manuscripts.
 I suggest you send him synopses for a minimum of three stories.  Keep the
synopsis of each down to two paragraphs at the most if possible.  Only cover
the main thrusts of the stories, without the extra details that flesh it out
(you'll have to use your judgement on this as to how much is "too much" in
the synopsis stage).  Also, please note that Sega requires the stories to be
action-packed and exciting, yet also humorous.  The stories must have some
funny moments and not be devoid of all humor.  You can send your submissions
to: Scott Fulop, Archie Comic Publications, Inc., 325 Fayette Avenue,
Mamaroneck, NY  10543.  Good luck!

IMHO, this communique from Paul Castiglia explains a lot about Archie
Comics.  It has also thoroughly cured me of the desire to submit
anything to Archie.

I used to think that some of the lame angles and (IMHO) badly-timed
humor in the comics was the fault of the writer -- the use of the "Cops"
theme at the end of "A Scrambled Hedgehog" (#27) was particularly
unforgivable.  Having read the above, however,
I now wonder whether the fault doesn't lie with the suits at Sega.

I have to think seriously about how many of the fanfic stories I've read
can pass muster with Sega's demand for "fast-paced and exciting, yet
also humorous."  The better ones go beyond those narrow bonds.  They
recognize that non-stop action and witty quips alone don't carry a story;
there's also mood and emotional impact.  Plotting a story by Sega's
standards explains a lot, such as why Sonic and Uncle Chuck didn't take
time out for a more heartfelt reunion in "The Return of Uncle Chuck"
(#30).  At least Pat Allee and Ben Hurst recognized this when they were
writing for the second season of Sonic on ABC.

So I'll stick with fanfic.  It doesn't pay but being able to write what
needs to be written (and not necessarily what meets Sega's demands) is
infinitely more satisfying.

I agree with ya there. I perfer fanfic over the comics. The stories I have
read have been made MUCH better than the comics I have of Archie IMO.  Most
of the stories were written VERY well.  What would be neat to me anyway,
would be to see a comic of Bloodlines, or Temporal Syndrome.  'Course
that'll never happen, but its nice to dream anyway. <G>

I felt your reaction to my post was a bit overzealous.  I never said the
stories had to be devoid of mood and emotional impact.  I just said they
shouldn't be devoid of humor.  What about a story that combines action,
humor, mood and emotional impact?  If you feel it hasn't been done yet, the
fault probably lies mainly in the fact that the comic format is restricted--
there are only so many pages alloted per issue for stories.  But that doesn't

Agreed :^)

>I never said the stories had to be devoid of mood and emotional impact.  

The ones with Julayana (sp?) and Tails and Fiona certainly had that 
(admittedly the latter was maybe a bit overdone, but still...)

Maybe this just points out the limitations _and_ benefits of comics vs. 
animation vs. fan-fic:

Comics may be the most restrictive in terms of space, but they're more 
readily accessible (i.e., you don't need a TV or an Internet connection to 
look at them :^)) and/or cheaper to produce than animation and fan-fic.

Animation is the most expensive to produce, but often the most enjoyable 
(IMHO) - both to look at, and to see/hear the characters interacting (I 
suppose if your imagination is powerful enough, comics and fan-fic will 
allow it too...)

Fan-fic allows the most flexibility (sometimes too much so), but is 
visually unappealing, and takes the most time to absorb (which is one 
reason I haven't read most of it; the grimness of what I have read being 
the other).

So each medium has their place, and we should all accept that, and 
concentrate on the one(s) we like best.

I feel silly, but considering that I'm the biology freak of this group, I
guess it's up to me. Unfortunately, my CD-Rom encyclopedia doesn't go into
enough detail to find that out, so I better break out the old Brittannica 30
volume set.

    In the SatAM show, Bunnie Rabbot wears a bottom-half to her leotard,

her lower half is apparently metallic-- robotic, if you will, and
(understandably) has been since her introduction.

Paul,

OK, I'll admit to being a little...overboard in my previous post.  But I
don't think it's without reason.

I only began being interested in the comics with issue #18.
Specifically, I was impressed with the way Kanterovich & Penders handled
the death of Julayla in "In The Still Of The Night" (Sally's Crusade,
Part 2).  They avoided using the D-word -- whether it's a Code thing or
Archie Comics policy, I don't know -- but there was no escaping the turn
of the plot.  If any story set the standard for "mood and emotional
impact" in the context of the Sonic stories, that had to be it.

By contrast, Decesare wasn't as adept at handling the presumed death of
Sonic in "That's The Spirit" (#20).  Tails' dogged insistance that Sonic
was still alive was good, but it could have been played off the grief of
the others a bit more.  And Sally's curt "Get over it!" attitude seemed
all wrong.

If my last post was intemperate, I can only say it was because
Gallagher's "Growing Pains" two-parter (#28-29) left such a bad taste in
my mouth.  The story had such promise, and it was so eagerly followed by
Tails' fans, only to turn into an enormous train wreck in Part 2.  Even
now I can't look at the thing without thinking in terms of how to
rewrite it.  Others were quick to spot the flaws in the plot: Tails'
escape from the roboticizer and Fiona's instant "rusting" were equally
contrived.  Worst of all, Gallagher waits until literally the last page
to practically hand the reader the premise of the Tails miniseries on a
silver plate.  There was virtually no foreshadowing, almost no
connection with what Tails had just gone through.  It was simply a case
of bad writing.

I'm aware that there are limitations to the medium; sometimes an artist
needs more space.  In this matter, Japanese _manga_ (with stories that
continue on for hundreds of pages) indulge in a luxury that few American
artists can afford.  Serializing some stories and adapting them as
"miniseries" is a step in the right direction.  Still, the question goes
back to how well the story is written. 

Just the $.02 of a fan,

Your 2 cents is always welcome.  You bring up good points.  I guess a lot of
it comes down to who is writing the stories as well.  Angelo DeCesare's
specialty has always been humor, while Penders and Kanterovich have worked on
their fair share of "serious" super-hero comics.  I have noted much disfavor
with some of the recent stories being voiced here online (including the Tails
mini-series) and have passed on those messages to the editor.  While there
are no guarantees (as always, SEGA ultimately has the final say), perhaps
your concerns will result in changes.  Thanks as always for being a fan!

To all concerned:

The reason for the disparity as it's been related to me is that our Bunnie is
based on the original model sheets drafted by Sega artists.  They continue to
approve her being drawn in this fashion and have not asked our artists to
switch to the Saturday morning cartoon style.  Hope this answers the
question...

Personally, I've always liked the way she has green eyes on the SatAM show
instead of the blue eyes in the comics. This has been brought up too. 

I'm glad that Archie decided to keep the 'old' design of Rotor.  He
really looked awful in the 2nd season of the SatAM show.

Well, it's happening again:

I try to Netscape over to:

     http://rat.org/pub/sonic/

and all I get for my troubles is a message that "File Contains No Data."
If I go directly to http://rat.org/pub/sonic/images/tv/ or whatever, I
can view stuff no sweat.  But I get the NO Data message every time I try
to get back to the parent directory.  Has my machine gone screwy on me,
or has anyone else had these problems?

I think I'll make a submit anyway.  Even if it *is* watered down, and doesn't
have as much of the good stuff (like the romance with Suni, and the rounds
with Packbell) it *will* be a big break in the conics field.  Maybe I can get
Archie to make two versions; a GA-rated one for kids, and the MA-version for
the rest of us who want the *real* story...

Subject: Sally and the pink bikini--  a minor descrepancy.
Status: O
X-Status: 

    I was loking through some of my older Sonics, and came across the
gag bit about Sally in a hot-pink string bikini (where she says,in
effect, no way).  Now, it suddenly occurred to me that her objection
cannot be that a bikini is immodest, because Sally normally don't wear
ANY clothes (other than the on-again, off again vest and her boots).
    After long and careful consideration I have com to the conclusion
that he Princess's true objection was that Pink isn't her color.
Really, it's not.  She'd look Awful in pink.  I'd suggest a french-cut
two-piecer, in black with red or blue piping. (:

I'm sure it is... :)  if I came on too strong, i apologize.  But, in the 
same token, I have many friends that have created cahrachters...what is 
the odds that ARCHIE would use these charachters in an STH comic book?

The other night.. no actually it was a morning, about 3onwards after my FT
session, I had the dangest dream. Now don't call me a nutcase, no.. my
family and friends do that.. don't call me a geek, my girlfriends already
donw that, don't laugh at me.. that would be so improper and unoriginal..
but in this dream Bunnie had Tails pinned lying on the floor with her
robotic arm on his stomach, 
Sally was tickling him on the chest, and his feet were kicking the soil like
on "I am Hiroshima" scale. (Perhaps it was like the canine scratch spot/kick
leg effort.)

Now, I am open to someone telling me what it means (or guessing), though I
already have had, "Too much FT" and "Foxes are magical mystical creatures,
while squirells and rabbits symbolize.. bla bla", but what I think would be
cooler is if someone would draw a piccy of it! (If you give me the B/W..
I'll do a mega colour version. Check the Tails page for a pic I 256'ed and
shaded.) 

So, come on pleeaaaaaaassseeeee!

"..and then.. a lightning bolt came down, and *somehow* it fried the
electric lines, just as I *accidently* got coffie in my keyboard. But my
computer didn't explode, not.. *somehow* it became sentient, and fell in

Hmm.. not exactly, simply being sentient doesn't lock anybody to a set
standard.. ie by the same thing you would suggest Robotnik should have the
same altitude as Sonic, or maybe even a similar aerial photo. hehe..
A lotta thing influence tempratures like lung size etc, now in my opinion
Sonic would be colder than Sally, simply because of his larger lungs..
unless of cause one of his great relatives was a shark, in which case he is
quite close in design to a motor-bike.. and will give the little children
"JAWS" scares for eternity.. But anyway, bigger lungs =3D after he runs, he
will be a lot hotter than Sally... that's my guess on them.

Whoever is was that suggested pink wasn't Sally's colour was wrong, it
actually doesn't cause a conflict with her.. it just makes her look plain.

I should know.

Long Story Here>> I got locked in a building today when I went to repair
Ian's pentium. The stupid moron had told me the door keys were on the table,
just before he left for some wedding or funeral or something. Well, I fixed
the problem on his PC, his modem wasn't dialing because he had the LINE
plugged into the phone connector on the back. So I was all pleased with
myself and charged up/ready to go home and do some coding... great.. only
the keys weren't on the table.. they weren't on any table in the entire
place.. Normally, I could have climbed out the window.. hopped the fence and
been gone.. only Ian lives the tenth floor in an apartment building..
briefly  I looked out the window and considered walking across the ledging..
however the strong wind that jerked my head.. was more than sufficient to
cool me back into town-life captivity.

I turned on the television.. Sport.. on every channel... except for one,
which was shoved full of politically correct crap. (Where the debators have
scripts!)

NO.. I couldn't take that.. I turned on his computer, he had a game menu...
I went into it and lo and behold.. Golf... tetris... and Pinball. I HATE
THOSE GAMES! I glanced at the door, it was only thin wood, a few succesive
flying-kicks would more than suffice to destroy it. I cursed myself for
being so damned responsible.

I watched the Lotus 123 tutorial.. twice.=20

I tried to crash golf.. but was rewarded by it crashing in the title screen,
thus saving me the task.

Then I stumbled across AutoDesk Animator.. amazingly he had it on his hard
drive, it wasn't the latest version, but it still was worth it. I know how
to use animator as Leslie my good friend has it, so I went straight to work.
I drew trees, tried to draw Ablater my FurrToonia character, but he ended up
looking like Mickey Mouse. (Ironic since Ab is a lynx) Finally I let my mind
drift, and then I decided I would do it.. I would draw princess Sally.. in
SwimWear. Well.. three hours went by, and with it too many cups of coffie.
Ian finally came back. (By then I had just finished Sal's shading.)

I stuck it on a disk and came back home. I looked at the picture a bit, and
wished I had pir8et a copy of animator. Well too bad I thought.. however as
fate should have it, I had to feed Les's doggies. (He's on holiday with the
Elephants ,Giraffes and Zebra)=20

I was at his house for 2 hours. And I changed textures a lot. Here are my
texture and colour votes:
                        =20
Faded Tiger        : 2
Tiger Orange/Red   : 4
Faded Pink Blotches: 6
Faded Gold         : 7=20
Gold Specks        : 8
Blue Specks        : 10

Well, I now have the GIF. and am sending it to Ratman, Oh ya, she is holding
a towel, and is in the meditation room I described on Furtoonia. Blue is
better on her.. that's why her boots were blue in the first place. Oh yah to
Archie Comics: "Kill the boots guys, and give her blue sneaker/ white
socks!" I did this in my picture and.. WHOOOOHAAAY! Needless to say, I will
be needing to either replace or dry out my keyboard of drool. :=B7)

I also tried to do a Sega nose. To all artists, stop drawing the white spot
on the top of Tails nose... his nose is reflective, and reflects his muzzle.
Take a look at the SEGA pics of him and Sonic (Their noses reflect them!)
Well, I did this with Sal's nose too, but I don't think her nose is
reflective, WHAA! Oh well...=20

Well. I'm sending the pic to rat_man now.. cheers All!


.. Blue is better!

I just read Alex's e-mail about the new Batchkles (sp?) story.  However, 
she failed to mention the name of the ftp site at which it can be found.  
Does anyone know the name of the site?  I'd really like to read the 
story.  (I'd ask Alex, but she said she'd be off the 'net for about 6 
months.)

Also, here's a hypothetical question for all you Sonic fans to consider:  
Suppose Bunny HAD BEEN partially roboticized in "Blast to the Past-Part 
2".  Would the robot part of her body have grown at the same rate as (if 
it would have grown at all, that is) the organic part?  I hope so, or she 
wouldn't have been a pretty sight as, say, a teenager!

Hear hye, hear ye, hear ye!  I, a Duly Ordained SubGenius Minster, do 
hereby make this MYSTIC PROPHECY using the clairvoyance granted me by my 
attainment of the Sacred State of Slack:

THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE INCIDENTS OCCURING WHERE THE CONSPIRACY TRIES 
TO SILENCE THE INTERNET.

Here's a Web page for you to look at that proves the truth of this prophecy:

	http://www.rru.com/rru/tru/

This is the URL for the Web page known as "Roadkills R Us."  As the title 
suggests, this Web page makes fun of Toys-R-Us, the megastore chain that 
drove Child World out of business and is gobbling up the competition.

What did the Web page in question do?  Why, they merely made fun of the 
giraffe that Toys-R-Us has as its corporate symbol.

And what did Toys-R-Us do in return?  They threatened a lawsuit against 
the owner of the Web page.  What's more, they "confidentially" contacted 
his Internet service provider and requested that his access to the 
Internet be removed ENTIRELY.

In the grand tradition of the Net, these actions backfired.  The page is 
now very popular, and the person running the p[age has gotten coverage in 
newspapers and on TV.

Thanks to the 2 Live Crew case, parody and satire is protected under the 
U.S. Constitution.  Therefore, Toys-R-Us doesn't have a leg to stand 
on...so instead, they've tried to act like bullies.

Typical for the Conspiracy, don't you think?

That's really nice, but what the hell does that have to do with Sonic?
This is known as "spam" and is a definate no-no.
Don't do it again.

Well, I'm probably going to get yelled at for this, too, but I figured I
should at least -try- to explain why I sent that through the list.

Quite simply, I saw a post on Usenet that noted a problem quite similar to
that of what we had recently with Sega about the `Mature Material' section
of the Sonic WWW page.  It was -not- a plug for the parody of the `Toys `R'
Us' web page, as such.  At least, that bit wasn't intentional.  Anyway, 
the whole point of that message was to show that we *do* have a leg
to stand on here about the snuff pieces.  It's not much, but it's something.  

Okay, so it wasn't directly Sonic related.  But it WAS fanfic related.
If that message annoyed anyone, I'm sorry.  I don't go out and do things
just to annoy people, after all, so I send you my apologies.  I just
thought you guys should know.  

Now, let's change the subject to something a bit more interesting...

There's a set of images at Rat's site :
  //rat.org/pub/sonic/images/icons/msonic/

These look like they're been somehow grabbed from the data in the 
Sonic 2 cartridge (or compiled from lots n lots of screen-grabs)

I was wondering if anyone knew how these were made and if this could
be done with Tails and Knuckles (from Sonic 3 & S&K).

Dear Doug:

Every time I try to email you personally, the mail is returned to me--
somehow, I can't seem to send mail to your server.  Therefore, please forgive
me for once again answering you through the mailing list.  There's nothing
really personal in my message, however, so all can read...

Anyway, you asked if it would be possible for Archie to use characters
created by fans in our Sonic comics.  Unfortunately, the likelihood of this
is basically non-existant due to the reasons I previously mentioned.  First,
SEGA creates most if not all of the characters in our Sonic comics, and
second, they do not want to open themselves (or Archie Comics, for that
matter) to a lawsuit.  Let me give you an example of why they (and we) have
this policy: a few years ago, we ran a recipe contest in "Jughead's Diner."
 As a prize, the winners had both their recipes printed and their likeness as
an Archie-style character drawn within a story.  Each winner and their
guardian had to sign a "permission" form stating we could reprint their
recipe and use their likeness.  Well, the father of the grand prize winner
refused to sign and sent us a letter full of "legaleze" claiming we could
potentially gain all sorts of financial profit and publicity from using the
recipe and his daughter's likeness, and that they should get a cut of all
that.  Of course, that's a ridiculous notion-- we certainly didn't get rich
printing the kid's letter-- it was just like printing a fan letter.  Of
course, the kid just wanted to win and get her name and recipe listed in the
book, in addition to her "appearance" in a comic story, and this move by her
litigous-minded dad greatly upset her!  Luckily, cooler heads (in the form of
her mother) prevailed, and we were able to run her recipe.  And guess what--
again, we didn't get rich off of it <g>!  Needless to say, then, rather than
run the risk of something like that, most companies prefer to wipe their
hands clean of using the customer's "ideas."  Hope this answers your
question...

Best regards, and have happy and safe holidays!

Hmmm, well, it may answer his question, but it raises one in my mind.  
Might I inquire...just where did the writers come up with the 
'Dragonspine Mountain Range' which, in case you forget, appeared in a 
Knuckles story a few issues back (I'll get back to you with the issue 
number if you need it.)  It so happens that a friend of mine of 
FurtooniaMUCK has been working on an area by the exact same name since 
March, and it freaked him out that you had something by the same name in 
a story just a few months later.  
Now, neither he nor I are making ANY accusations whatsoever.  We simply are 
curious as to where you got the idea from.

And, happy holuidays to you too.

and a speedy Simpsonesque looking hedgehog.

I wonder if Sega will try to get them not to show that episode again. :)

OK, sorry about the E-mail thing; I'm fixing that right now.  ANYWAYS, I

And I'll add to that. I'm 19 and therefore, the law says I can make my 
own choices, so if Archie ever wants to use and characters or ideas, jsut 
ask me, and I'll be able to give you the final word one way or the other.

As to whether Sega will "allow" the Simpsons episode to be rerun, the odds
are Sega gave them the permission to use Sonic in the first place.  That's
the way they do things-- in fact, they asked us permission when they wanted
the Archie characters to make a cameo, and since The Simpsons is the cultural
phenomenom it is, we couldn't say no!

I'm sure your parents would be "happy to sign," however, there is nothing to
sign.  I'm sorry to confuse you, but it's just company policy not to use
characters created by readers.  We can't bend the rules for a few.  The way
corporate thinking works, the person who says, "yeah, sure-- use my stuff"
today is the person who may come back tomorrow with a lawyer demanding their

Hey, just speakin' the truth.... good comics (in general!)  speaking of

I got an error when trying to play it in win95.
You should use a more standard video compression.

Do cartoon furries count? :)

I had a dream the other night/morning that was set in the "Sonic the
Hedgehog" universe (the GOOD one, not the suckworthy syndicated TV
version).  I appeared as a character of mine Ashley Rose, a 20 yo
Weasel that discovered the Freedom Fighters at Knothole while
trekking across Mobius looking for a new place to live.  (Much of his
story's background comes from a few previous dreams. :) Unfortunately
his girlfriend Lisa (a stoat) doesn't appear.. :(

Anyway, as the dream starts, I/Ash and the over Freedom Fighters are
involved in some battle with Robotnik in Hyperspace ("The Cosmic
Intestate") when a blast from a SWATBot knocks me off a transport and
sends me falling into oblivion for countless hours (compressed into a
few seconds during the dream :) ... After regaining consciousness,
(I'd falled asleep during the fall) I find myself lying in the dust
not far from "Knothole", but I notice that the season appears to have
changed, and I've arrived during a really bad Australian summer. (A
lot of the trees are almost leafless, and there's Dust, dust, and
more dust..)

Arriving in the Knothole area, I find that a small poor peasant
village now resides there, and the name of the place as changed too
(although I can't remember it now).  I find `Rotor' delivering a
small wicker basket of wheat.  He doesn't know who I am, but I
follow along asking questions and discover that on this planet
they've had a very severe drought for the past ten years, and the
Acorn family haven't sat on the Royal Throne of Mobius for centuries
(and thus Robotnik never eventuated).

Rotor arrives where he wants to deliver the wheat.  The King of the
other Mobius (Sally's Father, and a Fox) is under a shade down the
side of the house repairing a fishing net (I then notice the rank
smell of dead fish guts.. :P) I wait outside the doorway while Rotor
takes the baskets inside.  Sally then comes around from the side of
the hut--- this Sally is a bit smaller than I remember, looks a fair
bit leaner, and her fur isn't as well-kept and has a wiry look to it.

It's just then that the higher-order parts of my brain realise what
I've dreamt and spoils everything by getting over-excited and waking
me up. :)


(Furbound-- I'll be sending over another dream story after I finished
sending this one to the lists..)

A furry, if you don't know, is an animal who has taken on human 
characteristics. What I think Simon is trying to ask is, do you think it 
is possible to find a cow furry with Sonic, or would that sound too much 
like those Far Side comics?

I must say, you have a very interesting mind Ablater. I'll be getting to
work on your body temps question as soon as my mid-terms are over. As to
this question, I suppose the answer is, "Do you want there to be any?" Write
a story and include 'em. The Sonic Universe has room for expansion. I
suppose Robotnik would need a pretty big roboticizer to fit ol' Bossy
inside, but who knows? Could get interesting.....

Very impressive!  You've managed (however unconsciously) to conjure up a
dystopian Mobius where Robotnik isn't to blame.  While it DOES sort of
remind me of a couple Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes run
together (including "All Good Things...."), the set-up is original.  You
might want to go back to sleep and see where it leads you ;-) .

No, this doesn't sound like a stupid question.  If anything, it sounds
like one of Gary Larson's Far Side cartoons!  In fact, wasn't there a
Rescue Rangers cartoon involving alien cows from the planet Larson on
the far side of the universe?  But I'm getting off topic....

Come to think of it, who's to say that Sonic hasn't been scarfing
all-beef chili dogs the whole time?  Or is that prospect too
"disgustipatin'", to quote Popeye?

Actually, that was a Darkwing Duck episode (Twin Beaks, I think)...

>Come to think of it, who's to say that Sonic hasn't been scarfing
>all-beef chili dogs the whole time?  Or is that prospect too
>"disgustipatin'", to quote Popeye?

My take on this is that in general, animals used as food (e.g., cows,) or 
transportation (e.g., horses), are _not_ sentient.  Some shows that both 
confirm _and_ show exceptions to this:

Donald Duck et al are often seen eating turkey.

Tiny Toons had the characters eating hamburgers, but Hamton J. Pig was 
also a character.

The C.O.W.boys of Moo Mesa had sentient bovines riding horses (which I 
thought was a bit of a non sequitur - how come that meteor 
anthropomorphicized the one and not the other?)  What bothered me even more 
about that show was that some of the female cows didn't look that bad...

Ob. Sonic: I would assume that Sonic's chili dogs are all-beef, since in 
one episode (the Journey to the Center of Mobius one) he was served a bunch 
by a pig...

However, I was still a bit bothered by that chili-dog vending machine - 
it's kind of a dumb idea to begin with, and it shouldn't still be 
operating; are chili dogs some kind of relic from the games, ala Power Rings?

I apparently got my subscription copy last week, but I didn't check the
mail and so it ended up in my grandmother's pile of mail somehow and she
was out of town, and then yesterday, I had my eyes dilated and so I had it
but couldn't read it.  Finally, this morning I finished, and here's what I
thought: [SPOILER ALERT!]

The first story ("A Robot Rides the Rails") was great, but the poor art
kinda ruined it for me.   The kiss scenes in this one just didn't show the
feeling that the one in Sally #3 did.

The second story (Lost...and Found! part 1) was okay, but it was real
disappointing to find the story I'd been awaiting to be only a couple pages
long...as for the ending, ooh, we finally get to see Archimedes'
silhouette...looks kinda like Crocbot to me, only slimmer.  More on the
Knuckles mini-series; it's been delayed 'til April so Spaz and Harvo can
draw it.  Hey, that's ANOTHER thing that's been delayed 'til April so they
can perfect it (the other being a machine that I won't speak of since it's
competing with the cause of this mailing list).

Third story.  Tundra Road, Part 1.  It was good to see Rotor in a solo
story; he deserves it.  The art was better; the story wasn't bad; and the
"Waterworld" joke got a slight grin out of me.  As for the end, well, we
all know Rote survived; the REAL cliffhanger is, "Was his means of survival
as contrived and tasteless as Tails' in Issue 29?"

Subject: Interrogations

Here's something I've been wondering about for a while now.  On several 
occasions in the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon, we've seen Robotnik 
interrogate captured freedom fighters prior to roboticizing them.  Now, 
given that he has complete control over roboticized beings, wouldn't it

Whoa.. that's S3M.. it's stands for ScreamTracker Three Module, the S3M was
invented in 1992 when the Future Crew released their great tracker program
called.. take a guess -- Scream Tracker Three. Anyways.. you can get a
player on the Miles (Tails) Page, under the tool box.

Cheers, and enjoy those files.. more coming.. Breath deeply, you bring the

Yups, not unknown of here. I have had multiple of these dreams, usually they
are at their highest when I am on a coding spree. Caffeine is a very
powerfull drug, one you should not underestimate the power off. I've had the
port'al in the closet dream a hellofalotatimes.  As well as one very strange
dream where I was Sonic running over this hill, outrunning these metoir rock
efforts.

Furry Nightmares in my opinion are the worst, once I had a dream I was
furrocized and sold at a pet store... the rest was so .. ahum.. embarassing
that Ryan Huber was cracking himself for about half an hour.

Personally I prefer to meditate to get desired dreams, though furtoonia is
more addictive. (But mediation had pictures :P)

Sonic on the simpsons,

Probably the worst I saw in the case of lameness was Jazz, I'm sorry to have
to say this, but Jazz is such a load of shit... Why can't people come up
with original ideas?

Also, Jazz rips of Sonic pretty heavily at the end of one of it's bonus
episodes, (Zoonic - A half hedgehog, half fox .. thing.)

But on idea snatching, some of you might notice Sonic stops with a skidding
sound, originally done with Nintendo's Mario Brothers Three, in Mario, you
get a leaf and then a tail, and flap-flap, in Sonic, we have Tails, while in
Jazz an annoying parrot... Well, I guess all games, good or bad are just
another version of that good old game where you had two bats, and that
rather square ball...

That's one thing you don't see in the comics, or toons. I betcha the
producers had you all believing that Sonic, Sally, Tails, Rotor and Bunnie
are herbivores, and so peacefull they "live in peace with the world bla
bla.. can't kill etc.."

The answer to this is.. It's a lie! It's all a pack of lies! Lies I tell you
hahahaah! They are all bipedal sentients, and even if they weren't Tails,
and Rotor would still need meat. Foxes ya know are all carnivourous. 
Besides those chili dogs have to have some meat in them, yeah, yeah I know
these cheap hamburger places get away with putting more soya bean in the
patti's than meat.. but there still is meat! 

Now think of the sweet characters you love, imagine say.. Sally for
example.. getting a chicken and the big axey..

ARGHH! Coder Quality Nightmares of me being a chicken, and my reflection in
her phongy nose, and refractive eyes, as she lives the blade. NOOOOOOOO!

Maybe this would be a cool idea for my story? Robotnik plans a new method of
destroying the freedom fighters by evoluting all non-sentient animals. The
animals then go full out PC, and sue dear Sonic. Crap cakes, this is
beginning to sound like that godsdamned syndicated series.

To all Sonic fans:

In recent days, the Archie offices have received numerous phone calls from
Sonic fans.  The calls were mainly to editor Scott Fulop and artist Patrick
Spaziante.  We would like to ask everyone to please refrain from all such
calls immediately.  By tying up our employees on the phone, you are keeping
them from producing the comic book adventures of your favorite blue hedgehog
and pals in a timely fashion.  Likewise, you are endangering their jobs as
the bosses do not like to see the employees tied up on the phone lines.  It
is crucial that they not be disturbed.  The best way to tell Scott or Pat
what is on your mind is by sending them letters to the Sonic Grams address.
 While there is no guarantee they will be able to respond to all the letters
on the letters page, and certainly no time to personally respond, each letter
is read and your comments duly noted.  Also, please note that Archie Comics
policy is such that we do NOT accept "ideas" from fans.  If you are over 18
and have some education behind you, the editor will look at synopses for
Sonic stories featuring characters already appearing in our comics, however
there are no guarantees.  Please see an earlier post for submissions
guidelines.  Please understand that time is of the essence in comic book
publishing, and any delays could ultimately result in the delays-- or even
cancellation-- of your favorite comic book titles.  

Thank you.

If you remember seeing, "Spyhog", first of all, Robotnik and company 
enjoy interrogations. Snively with the escargo, enough said. If they 
roboticized them and plugged them in, it would take the fun out of 
interrogations. Unless, of course, they wanted the information bad 
enough. When Sir Charles got caught, first they asked him about Knothole 
and then they plugged him in. Fortunately Sonic unplugged Charles before 
he told the location of Knothole. But if he didn't unplug him in time, 
Charles would have talked.

This is a good question... I think I might have a reasonable 
explanation even though it requires me to sound like one of 
those scary people you sometimes meet at Trek conventions...

Okay... lets diagram how a 'normal' organic brain might be set up...
(I just made this up about 15 minutes ago)

              .--------.
              | Memory |<---.
              `--------'    |
      2-way ->  /\  \/      |
             .----------.   |  .----------------.
             |   Will   |   |  |    Sensory     |
             |  Emotion |<--+--|     Input      |
             |  Desire  |   |  | (eyes, ears..) |
             `----------'   |  `----------------'
                  \/        |
              .---------.   |
              |  Motor  |<--'
              | Control |
              `---------'

[ Like this ASCII diagram?  I drew it on the fly... nifty ey? ]

Anyway... I know this is woefully incomplete... Also.. when I first drew
this up I had a section called 'Reasoning' but now that I think about it
it might be better to say that 'reasoning' occurs in all of these sections.

So what does this have to do with anything??

Here's what I deduce happens to someone's mind during robitization...

              .--------.
              | Memory |<---.
              `--------'    |
      2-way ->  /\  \/      |
             .----------.   |  .----------------.
             |   Will   |   |  |    Sensory     |
             |  Emotion |<--+--|     Input      |
             |  Desire  |   |  | (eyes, ears..) |
             `----------'   |  `----------------'
     LINK CUT! -->          |          \/
              .---------.   |  +------------------+
              |  Motor  |<--'  | Computer Control |
              | Control |<-----|      System      |
              `---------'      +------------------+

This newly added "computer control system" now takes over the motor
controls...  It can run programs and make the robotiziced person obey
commands.  Also...  the person can still see and feel what's going on 
but can't do anything about it (as Uncle Chuck had said). 

This setup also means that a robotiziced person's computer control 
system probably contains its own memory and is unable to access the 
memory of the person hence interrogating a robotiziced person will get 
you nothing about his/her life before being robotiziced.

(I could've probably explaned all this without the geeky diagrams but
I like geeky diagrams :-)

In Uncle Chuck's case, my guess is that the "Will to Motor" link was
restored by the power ring.

Also... remember in the episode 'Spyhog' Robotnik DID use some sort of
contraption to try to extract information out of Uncle Chuck... 

I'm guessing this 'memory extractor' contraption was either brand new
(otherwise why wouldn't he have used it before on any of the roboticized
freedom fighters... like 'Cat') 
   OR 
It could be a special machine that would only work on someone who's 
"Will to Motor" link has been restored (Like Chuck's).

  ---

Anyway.. that's all I have to say about this subject (which was probably
too much).

more unusual note... in most of my 'flying' dreams I end up flying upside

Good point!  But... would robots be able to tell them what they "know?", 
I mean, I thought they lost their...um... memories.  So, they're kind of 
like "charmed" people, so that may or may not work.

That would be my friend and I.  We are interested in learning about 
upcomming events, etc.  You make it sound like we are evil!  Sheesh, I 
made ONE single call, and it was for no more than 5 minutes.

Come on, endangering their jobs?  I don't mean to sound rude, honestly, 
but I'm sure you're really going to "fire" someone because they take time 
to talk to someone that admires them.  These are the "company pollicies" 
that ruin such good businesses as Archie Comics.  I can understand if 
there was an overwhelming amount of calls, but a few calls didn't seem to 
hurt.  Besides, I think it is the artist's/editor's job to inform a fan 
if we are being annoying and/or if they are busy.  But taking the time to 
talk for five minutes or so a day greatly improves company relations with 
the "little people" that buy your comics.  In fact, before I read this 
letter, I was ready to type up a full letter explaining my happiness that 
I even got the "privlidge" of talking to Spaz.  But now, it looks as if I 
have done a bad thing, and my fantasy ruined.

It is my understanding that they never see but a handful of the vast 
amount of Sonic Gram letters you recieve a day.  In fact, this is 
probably (as I understand it) the WORST way to contact these individuals.

Unfortunately, that is the case.  I understand WHY you don't take ideas 
from us "young fools", because (supposedly) all we are are money 
grabbers.  That, as I have already explained, is not the case, but since 
this is a no-win battle, I won't go into that.

Now now, Mr. Castigila, just because I am young does not mean I am an 
idiot.  I understand that you may be under a tight deadline, but you have 
blown this thing up from the start.  And let me explain to you why: 
myself and Michael Rheyes were the ONLY two people to make such calls, 
therefore, explaining (above) that there were MANY calls is a farce.  IN 
TOTAL, we COMBINED made 4 calls.  And, perhaps, in total, we may have 
spent a half hour on the phone with your people.  Now, let me go 
off for a while about this: FIRST OFF, you are not going to cancel Sonic

OK, I've let some topics slide, but THIS is one I can't afford to skip.

I've recently reread the fanfic that alludes to Christmas on Mobius.
Allegedly.  It got me to thinking.

When looked at seriously, none of the stories -- David Pistone's "Merry
Christmas" and Ryan Huber's "Silent Night" -- have anything substantive
to say about Christmas.  At least the Christmas that's bound up with the
Incarnation of Jesus Christ.  Then again, neither did Dickens'
"Christmas Carol."  As C. S. Lewis put it: "Mary, the magi and the
angels are replaced by spirits of [Dickens'] own invention, and the
animals present are not the ox and the ass in the stable, but the goose
and the turkey in the poulterer's shop."

Lest you start thinking grinch-like thoughts about me, I'd better come
clean: I'm a Christian, specifically a Seventh-day Adventist.  I
converted back in 1968, just before I turned 17 -- I assume that makes
me the "old man" of the list.  I don't share the conservatism of the
evangelical crowd, but since my B.A. degree was in theology, I have more
than a passing interest in such matters.

So anyway.  It's just as well that neither David nor Ryan got into the
Christmas angle with anything like depth.  Whatever else Christmas on
Mobius might be, it wouldn't necessarily resemble the Earthly variety.

Then again, I think I'd have to know a lot more about Mobian cosmology.
Unfortunately, the creative powers that be at Archie seem to be relying
on the process called "making it up as we go."  I've tried discerning a
coherent mythology/theology involving the Chaos Emeralds, with no real
luck.  And the Ancient Walkers feel more like Ancient Walk-Ons --
they're nothing more than mask-wearing plot devices used to keep the
story moving when things get sticky.

My point?  I can see winter stories, such as "Heart of Snow" and "Cold
Shoulder" by Joseph DeLaCroix, but trying to import Christmas to Mobius
is a bit of a stretch.  If only because  the holiday wouldn't be Mobian
enough, if you know what I mean.

BTW: on the subject of missionaries, they'd first have to get past any
prejudice that rational thought is what separates humans from animals.
Without that, they'd consider Mobian furries to be simply zoo bait.

I know I'll get flamed for some of my above comments, but don't let them
spoil your Christmas.

True.  But, of course, they (like myself) try to avoid the potential of
overriding any future dogma by attaching religion to fanfic characters.
Then there's the choice of what do you make who?  Are they all
psudo-Christians?  Jewish?  If they aren't, who is what, and why?   
And, of course, there's the danger of certain individuals in suits whose
names I shall not mention disliking the way it was done, and suing.

Quite understandable.  =)

Well....there might be some things that -could- be universal.  Gift-giving,
perhaps, or putting up some sort of plant and decorating it.  But the
religion behind it, however, would probably be different.

A friend and I are working on that exact problem.  We're basically working
on a history of Knuckles' people and the Chaos Emeralds.  It should be
pretty coherent, once we're done.

>My point?  I can see winter stories, such as "Heart of Snow" and "Cold

>is a bit of a stretch.  If only because  the holiday wouldn't be Mobian
>enough, if you know what I mean.

Well, I have my own theory on Mobian religion.  (Don't hurt me.)

Basically, before the war and probably now, most Mobians (with the
exception of a man with a large nose and a rotund redhead) lived in a
certain level of peace with nature.  (Mobitropolis was a garden city, most
of the world was unspoiled wilderness, etc.) It was a very `green' place,
as it would, and since the inhabitants are anthropromorphic...

Well, perhaps most (if not all) Mobians would be Wiccan-ish.

For those who don't know what I just said, Wiccan is a type of religion
that is best summed up by stating it is Gaia-oriented.  (They worship the
Earth and such.)  It'd fit like a glove on Mobian society; after all, they
are against Robotnik, a polluting tyrant, and want to return to the old
ways, which were ecologically sound.  

(Now, before you people at Sega sneak into my house and beat me with legal
pads, this is just my -opinion-.  I am not stating that your licenced,
copyrighted characters ARE, I'm just saying they MIGHT be.  So go kick 
a few puppies, eh?)

>BTW: on the subject of missionaries, they'd first have to get past any
>prejudice that rational thought is what separates humans from animals.
>Without that, they'd consider Mobian furries to be simply zoo bait.

Well, I think seeing Robtropolis from orbit would probably scare most
aliens off, anyway.  =P  =)

Nah.  You didn't say anything particularly inflammatory.  *I* probably did,
but I'm just going to hide behind Sandra for a while...  ;)

Hehe, if I wasn't religious myself I'd be tempted to write a story with the
ending lines being Sonic saying, "Well at least buttnik did something good."

But then again I would probably go to hell if I did, or haydes/ have my soul
be eternally destroyed and/or be reincarnated as a furry and sold in a pet
store.

There are some programs that convert Gifs and Bitmaps into ASCII art. I 
don't know the exact location, but there is one at Acs.Oakland (address: 
http://www.oak.oakland/oak.html. Look in the MS-Dos section under 
converters, I think, and you just might find one. 
	One hint about making ASCII art - you need to start with a B&W 
outline. Then you need to make it so the lines are white and the rest is 
black. Convert the picture to whatever format the ASCII converter calls for
(Gif or BMP) and then run the program. The proper syntax should be:

ASCIImkr picture.gif/bmp

	I have an ASCII Tails, but there isn't enough room in my sig for 
it.  Oh well.

If you use a PC, check out http://rat.org/pub/msdos/ and you'll find 2 
(count 'em!) GIF to ASCII converters.  I got them both from Delphi, and 
neither had a doc file.  Some trial and error will be required.

I was thinking about having a storyline regarding the creation of Mobius
(also involving the various Gems...that was where I first came up with the
idea that the Chaos Emeralds weren't the only Gems Mobius relies on...),
but I thought of other storylines and I've worked on them first...I'll
probably never finish, partially because the key characters in that story
are clubmems who went bye-bye...

Yeah...in my Christmas story, which I wrote a year ago, I had the holiday
"Mobianized" when it was brought in by some of the FF's who had originally
come from Earth.  They kept the "Peace on Earth, good will toward men" idea
without having the "birth of Christ" part in there (since the former
applies to all planets and the latter would perhaps seem less important in
a world other than the one Christ inhabited).

><

Oh, and for the record, Dickens DID mention Christ a couple times in A
Christmas Carol.

Seems to me that in one of the syndicated Sonic episodes ("Mama Robotnik
Returns"), the milk-delivery hover-truck driver is a cow.  So sure, why
not have sentient Mobian bovines? 

On the other hand, Muttski didn't seem to be all that sentient when he
appeared in the Sonic comic mini-series.  (I wonder if his robotocization
changed that?  I guess we'll find out in issue #32.)  So not all terrestrial
species have sentient counterparts on Mobius.

As for getting ones characters in the comics, isn't that what the 
Sonic-grams and Sonic Art pages are for?  Even a single panel can 
tell a whole story.  Mind you, the chances of having ones art or
letter chosen for publication must be rather slim with all the fan
mail Sonic must get!

Preciesly <sp?> why I'm upset..... there are so many people out 
there....and if only comic book companies, (Like Archie,) would take the 
time to nitice this.  And not only are there fans out there ready to read 
and view our (good) artwork and stories, I'm sure there's some sort of 
market for it.  $$$.  :)

Nope... I just got Issue #32 and yes, we get to see a return of Muttski. I
won't go into details or give any spoilers, but Muttski is still a dog (a
robot dog, but not a sentient one). 

I don't have time to review #32 by the way... At least the artwork is
back up to 'par' (pencils by Art Mawhinney).

True... like that fan-art drawing of Sonic and St. John about to duke
it out while Knuckles gets the princess.

I have to wonder... How much fan mail DOES Sonic (& Friends) get in a
month at Archie?  Also... are letters often printed in full or is the
text cut down a bit to save space?

Wait til I start on a story I dreamed up one day, which crosses "Sonic the
Hedgehog" with Aslan from "The Lion, The Witch, And the Wardrobe,"  but the
storyline will, of course, be original, no Mobian will get 'saved'--Hey, they

Subject: Christmas? on Mobius
Status: O
X-Status: 

	After digging into the background origins of Christmas, thanks to a 
Sociology class I had a year ago, you would kinda wonder what related holiday 
Mobius would have. Allow me to explain.
	In the days of the Roman Empire, on or about December 25, there 
was a holiday called Boxing Day (No, this isn't the holiday for Mohammed 
Ali). Throughout the year, Roman citizens would take their loose pocket 
change and put in into a box made of Alabaster, a rock simular in color 
and hardness to gold. On Boxing Day, they would take the box and break it 
open, take all the money, and have a big party in the town.
	According to more accurate astronomy, the Star of Bethlaham, the 
sign of Christ's birth, probably appeared on or about September 12 or 
13, 75 BC. When the Christians overthrew the Romans, the Romans were allowed 
to keep a few holidays. So, as a convieniance for the Romans and Christians, 
the day of Christ's birth was moved to December 25, the Roman's former 
Boxing Day.
	Now, going under the presumption that Christ was not born on 
Mobius, you would think there would be a simular holiday there. It may 
not signify Christ's birth, but it would have some other cultural 
significance. I suppose the thing to do in this "Christmas on Mobius" 
matter is - just keep an open mind. Besides, with all of the visitors 
they have been getting from the fan-fiction stories (Joseph and anyone 
else I may have missed), I'm pretty sure they would bring thier cultural 
holiday to Mobius. And if the dates jel, well... like I said, keep an 
open mind about it.
	Well, any-who, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and a 
Happy New Year.

Ummm, okay.  It's Christmas.  Good thing.  Thing is, I have a couple questions:

1. I'm almost finished with my story, The Hunt Begins.  Can I still send it
to the list, or did someone say not to do that anymore?!  I sincerely hope
the former, but I THINK someone sent me a nasty-gram when I u/l'ed Blue Flames.

2. One of my Christmas presents (which I'm getting Friday, I think; I know
I don't have it yet) is a scanner.  As I'm obviously going to be using it a
LOT (at least at first, and maybe even at second <G>), I'd like to figure
out how to upload files to Rat's FTP, since I STILL don't have my
grandmother's password to use GINA and am stuck with Prodigy's text-only

could send somebody who has both Prodigy and the REAL NET (Matt, Eric, I'm

Subject: Re: Tails #3 (for the FAQ sheet)
Status: O
X-Status: 

John,

Thanks for posting the summary.  I usually reserve comment on a story
until I've had a chance to read it myself (which is totally dependent
upon the fact that this corner of Michigan must be one of the LAST to
get the comics!), but I've gotten enough clues from your summary to make
a couple observations:

* The whole business with Athair feels like a separate story tacked onto
"Southern Crossover."  It's convenient in that it's a way for Tails to
get patched up in a hurry, but everything about the emeralds and the
Saurian Age is thrown at us at once, in part 3 of a 3-parter.  A little
less detail, or a little foreshadowing, wouldn't have hurt (e.g., have a
panel showing Athain in silhouette sensing Tails' arrival at the same
time CrocBot picks him up on radar).

* OK, Gallagher can draw.  That doesn't necessarily justify the running
device of "Tails To Astonish" -- I've already objected that that plot
device became useless when the Sea Fox went down (see below).  The same
results could have been obtained, for instance, in #2 in a conversation
between Tails and one of the Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters: Tails might
start waxing nostalgic about Knothole, then stops himself when he
remembers how mad at the others he's supposed to be. Sample dialog:
  Tails: Not that they'd ever take me seriously....
  Fluke: Yeah, they're always treating you like a little kid.
  Tails (shocked): That's right!!  How did you know?
  Fluke: I didn't.  But that's the way I felt about the older whales in
  my herd when I was your age.
You get the idea.  Likewise, if I were as banged up as Tails at the
beginning of #3 I don't think I'd be in any shape to work on comics.
The last time I had the flu I didn't want to write: all I wanted was to
get the license number of the truck that backed over me and then have a
nice, quiet coma. ;-)  Besides, where would Tails have gotten the art
supplies in the crater?

* Sorry, but I don't buy the restoration of the Sea Fox.  I know this is
a comic book, but come on!  I'll have to read #3 myself to see whether
Tails' change of heart is any more credible -- nothing in #1 or #2
provides sufficient motivation.

At least #3 sounds more credible overall than the second half of
"Growing Pains" in Sonic #29.  One of these days I'm going to post my
rewrite of that train wreck.  Sample dialogue from Fiona: "No offense,
Tails, but you kiss like a boy."

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest@lists.mv.net)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

The Sonic mailing list opened on 4 February 1995.  This is a low-
to medium-volume list; you can normally expect to receive 5-10
list messages per day (though variations can and do occur).

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  You may change your subscription
status from "live" to digest or from digest to "live" at any time.
If you decide to change your subscription status, be sure that you
unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore, or you will
be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages twice.
See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net.
This address applies to both versions of the list.  If you feel
you must flame someone, please do so in e-mail directly to that
person.  Let's focus on fighting Robotnik, not each other.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters and
stories in the Sonic comics, cartoons, and fan fiction.  You may post
messages on the Sonic games to the extent that the focus is on the
Sonic/Mobius story and/or characters, and not on the games themselves.
Asking why a game character rarely appears in the comics is on-topic,
but asking how to become "Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.  If you are
interested in the Sonic games too (or instead), please see the "Other
Internet Resources" section below.

Please do not post any of the following types of material: files,
commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.  If you do,
you are subject to immediate removal from the list and suspension or
termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt, please contact
the list manager before posting.  Sonic-related fan fiction, images,
and sounds may be uploaded by ftp to rat.org or mailed to rat@rat.org.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read them
before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from the ftp
site in /pub/sonic/text as faq-dd.txt and faq-jf.txt.  The Sonic
Merchandise List can be found in the same directory.  See "FTP Site"
below for more information.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
messages, send the command "get sonic mail.txt" (but without the
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo@lists.mv.net (do
not use the Subject line because majordomo will ignore it).

How To Change Your Status
=========================
To change from "live" to digest, send this text inside a message to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic-digest
    unsubscribe sonic
    end

To change from digest to "live", send this text inside a message to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic
    unsubscribe sonic-digest
    end

Do not place any commands in the Subject line as majordomo will ignore
them.


FTP SITE
========
There is a companion anonymous ftp site for this list.  Just ftp to
rat.org and go to /pub/sonic.  Upload files to /incoming; all uploads
are subject to approval.  You will find sounds, images, list archives
and a variety of information.  The directory containing "adult" images
has been removed at Sega's request.

Users without regular ftp access: Contributions may be sent by e-mail
to rat@rat.org.  Existing files may be obtained via ftpmail.  Please
contact the list manager if you need help finding a ftpmail server.

Other Internet Resources

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest@lists.mv.net)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

The Sonic mailing list opened on 4 February 1995.  This is a low-
to medium-volume list; you can normally expect to receive 5-10
list messages per day (though variations can and do occur).

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  You may change your subscription
status from "live" to digest or from digest to "live" at any time.
If you decide to change your subscription status, be sure that you
unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore, or you will
be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages twice.
See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net.
This address applies to both versions of the list.  If you feel
you must flame someone, please do so in e-mail directly to that
person.  Let's focus on fighting Robotnik, not each other.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters and
stories in the Sonic comics, cartoons, and fan fiction.  You may post
messages on the Sonic games to the extent that the focus is on the
Sonic/Mobius story and/or characters, and not on the games themselves.
Asking why a game character rarely appears in the comics is on-topic,
but asking how to become "Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.  If you are
interested in the Sonic games too (or instead), please see the "Other
Internet Resources" section below.

Please do not post any of the following types of material: files,
commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.  If you do,
you are subject to immediate removal from the list and suspension or
termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt, please contact
the list manager before posting.  Sonic-related fan fiction, images,
and sounds may be uploaded by ftp to rat.org or mailed to rat@rat.org.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read them
before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from the ftp
site in /pub/sonic/text as faq-dd.txt and faq-jf.txt.  The Sonic
Merchandise List can be found in the same directory.  See "FTP Site"
below for more information.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
messages, send the command "get sonic mail.txt" (but without the
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo@lists.mv.net (do
not use the Subject line because majordomo will ignore it).

How To Change Your Status
=========================
To change from "live" to digest, send this text inside a message to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic-digest
    unsubscribe sonic
    end

To change from digest to "live", send this text inside a message to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic
    unsubscribe sonic-digest
    end

Do not place any commands in the Subject line as majordomo will ignore
them.


FTP SITE
========
There is a companion anonymous ftp site for this list.  Just ftp to
rat.org and go to /pub/sonic.  Upload files to /incoming; all uploads
are subject to approval.  You will find sounds, images, list archives
and a variety of information.  The directory containing "adult" images
has been removed at Sega's request.

Users without regular ftp access: Contributions may be sent by e-mail
to rat@rat.org.  Existing files may be obtained via ftpmail.  Please
contact the list manager if you need help finding a ftpmail server.

Other Internet Resources
========================
rec.games.video.sega and alt.sega.genesis
    Two Usenet groups for discussion of Sonic the Hedgehog and other
    games from SEGA.  Use these groups instead of this mailing list
    if you want to discuss the Sonic games, get codes/cheats, etc.

    read that group's FAQ before posting there.
alt.binaries.pictures.cartoons and alt.toon-pics
    Two Usenet groups for posting image files related to cartoons.
    The a.b.p.c group was intended to replace the a.t-p group.
    Some sites will carry one of them, some will carry both of
    them, and many sites don't carry either of them.
alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting digitized sound files related to
    cartoons.  This group is not widely propogated.
FurryMUCK and FurToonia
    These systems are online MU* games that allow users to roleplay
    Sonic characters.  You must have unrestricted telnet access to
    play these games.  FurryMUCK may be reached at furry.org, port 8888;
    FurToonia may be reached at red_panda.tbyte.com, port 9999.  For
    more information on these games (and on dedicated MU* clients),
    please see the FAQ's posted to the newsgroups alt.fan.furry and
    alt.fan.furry.muck.
WWW
    The mailing list has a companion Web site with information,
    images, and links to Sonic-related newsgroups and other Web
    sites.  You'll find it at http://rat.org/sonic/ .

Many thanks to Ratman (Paul Hurley) for giving us a virtual Knothole.

A few weeks ago, someone was talking about why Robotnik interrigates his 
prisoners before he reboticizes them. Yesterday, I was rummaging through 
my files and I found this interesting excert from Dan Drazen's Bloodlines.

	"And as for you," he said as he turned his attention to Bunnie, 
"you won't be roboticized just yet--not until you've told me everything I 
want to know about Knothole."
	"In your dreams, Robotnik!"
	"Do you know what I dream of, my dear? Ways of extracting 
information from reluctant forest folk such as yourself. You WILL tell me 
what you know. And I assure you that the method I will use to learn what 
I want to know from you will be slower and more painful than necessary."

Greetings all,

For those of you that have recently joined the list etc, and missed the
origin of the game development team... there is another chance to join.

First let me explain what our idea is.. the next Sonic the hedgehog for PC..=
=20
There are a few little things that it can boast:

VGA 256 Color GFX.
Real Paralax Scrolling & Multiple Paralax techniques.
Digital Sound (As opposed to cruddy FM)
Stereo Sound Effects.
Joystick/Joypad support.
Well there are more features.. like the playable characters but I won't
spoil that for you just yet. Also, I wouldn't be so bold as to call it Sonic
4.. SEGA, might one-day make their own Sonic-4.. and/or assimilate me. O_o

Of course.. We need as much help as possible. So if you think you can be of
service to us.. just mail me : Ablater@lin01.global.co.za and tell me your
abilities and/or where I can get samples of your work. (You may attach stuff
too, but please not more than 1Mb)=20

I used to have a biggo fancy form to fill in, but when my mail baskets got
too full.. I .. well... compressed them with that great DOS 6 compression
program -- "Deltree" (It's an amazing compressor.. 30 Mb to 0 bytes in
20seconds! ;)      )
Well, I guess just some info on your self would be nice though.. real name
etc.. and especially your abilities.. boast like hell :=B7)=20

I'm no officious high-high-smooth-smooth lordo, and I'm not going to reject
you. Nor am I going to lemon ya into drawing 4000 frames; but all help is
needed.. the more of us there are.. the easier it will be.

-----------------------------------
             Info_Z
-----------------------------------
The game is being written in Turbo Pascal,
though will be moved to Borland Pascal (Ie 286-extender -- But 386Asm Code).=
=20
Assembler is used for speed. 256Colors ModeX, SoundBlaster=20
series fully supported, and 8 channel digital music, and
4 channels sound FX.

I apologize that this message is so short, but I am very busy at the moment
at writing the sound system.=20

Cheers

Hi! How ya doin!

I really wish I could help with your game, but, sadly, I am a novice at
programing and multimedia (I am very good at hacking, and now have a war with
the school security system, in fact, I am winning. I don't think that helps
though). I wish you a lot of luck, and protection from SEGA's lawyers
("though" again).

Anyway, I did think up of a nice idea, though (thay just keep comming, don't
they). What if SEGA took one of it's really nice and fast racing games, added
a couple of enemies and obsticles, a couple of rings, some really nice
graphics, a contract with DiC,  and put a cool looking hedgehog on the bottom
of the screen. (Taking a breath... Wow, what a run-on!)

Free chance to be a crittic!
      Anyone?

Hello everybody!
   I am a new, 16 year old, member who is a B-I-G fan of Sonic, and am very
thankfull for all really cool info you have posted on this board (I got the
archive just a while ago). In fact, I really didn't understand the Sonic
world completely untill you guys stuffed me up with it (better choice of
words?). I am originally from Ukraine and that might explain the name and the
gramatical/spelling errors (Hey, there's one!), and currently am working on a
StH story and chess pieces (I just found out that I am pretty good at
sculpting). I have one Archie StH comic, and one StH Satturday episode which
I recorded during it's running time and keeping it in a very secure place (By
the way, has anyone heard from David Pistone? He doesn't seem to be getting
my message). Just so as to be on track, what is the current popular
discussion here? (do tell)

I've got ideas too.

A code I came up with which I only want to tell the mail

----
In the background on the "game over" screen have animation of one or all the
Freedom Fighters getting roboticized
----
Make an opening sequence like the one on Sonic CD, only better
----
Let my brother do some of the music.  Give me the "snail mail" address of
where to send a tape and I'll try to get it out as soon as I can.  He plays
excellent keyboard and has thought up a few things already
----
When sonic becomes invincible, he could take out a power ring or something...

I'm trying to come up with more stuff.  I'd put it in this letter, but I
don't have the time right now.  Email me if you have any questions about this
stuff.  Thanks.

Great, um, just one small thing.. could you post them to me instead of the
list. (There are spies everywhere I tell you! he he )  But on the serious
side, I don't want to clog this list with the game development.. a lot of
people would get getting mail that has nothing to do with them.

Thanks for everyones interest,

You can mail me at: ablater@lin01.global.co.za [See that in the top

This message might offend some people, so, if it offends
you, I am sorry in advance.

Anyway, here it goes:

Why do the writers make Robotnik tell stupid jokes? Why jokes at all? He's a
madman who is allways in a bad mood. People in a bad mood (or, do to some
accidents involving the hedgehog, is in a terrible mood) dont tell jokes?!
Especially not _BAD_ jokes! And I think I saw some of you write that
Bloodlines (I loved that story) was too depressing. Well, of course it's
depressing! Wars are allways depressing! There's a _HOLOCAUST_ going on for
@#!%$# sakes! I mean, some stories write about a group that goes out
to plant bombs in a factory, the group is having fun, and the group is
allways happy. WHAT ABOUT THE _WAR_?! Also Robotnik. Why is he portrayed as
being so stupid? (Lot's of stories I have read have that) If he's an idiot,
Than the whole Mobius is made up of idiots! Robotnik, an "evil GENIUS",
outsmarted the whole world, and thus 
became the "planet's overlord". Why doesn't anyone (or at least
only a very small amount of people) pay any attention to these 
things!? 
Thank you for listening and helping me get this off of my back.

                       HAPPY NEW YEAR KNOTHOLE!
Hopefully this little message will be the New Year's resolution :'{

Today, for the second week in a row, USA preempted Sonic for some lame
movie.  I don't care if it happens to be Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve;
under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should ANYONE be allowed to change early Sunday
morning programming.  It's common courtesy; you can't preempt something
without leaving a way to know you have, and the TV listings don't come in
until Sunday morning (unless you get TV Guide, which I don't anymore), when
it's too late.  In any case, I think they should have put at the end of the
December 17 Sonic episode a message to this effect: "ATTENTION!  Sonic the
Hedgehog will NOT be shown for the next two weeks, so if you're a fan who
likes the show so much that you miss Mad TV the night before so you can set
your alarm clock to 6:50 AM, and then often go back to sleep after the
show's over, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SO UNTIL JANUARY 7!  Repeat, Sonic the
Hedgehog will NOT be shown for the next two weeks!!!"  Anybody else have
that problem, or does it come on at a reasonable time in other areas?

Good questions.  I try to portray Robotnik (well, Julian, actually, in most

any!)

Why didn't Han J. LEE think of drawing Sonic like this?

P. S. If you move this character "|" one space to the left, Sonic will gine a

The story:

     Sally had once heard that the darkest hours were those just before
sunrise.  Now, as she walked towards the lookout post, she believed it.  She
could hardly see where she was going!  She continued on, though, as experience
(and Nicole, of course) told her she was headed in the right direction.
     Ever since her father, King Acorn, had once convinced his daughter, with
some difficulty, to get out of bed and watch the sunrise with him, she had been
dazzled by it.  Even now, despite the pollution that Robotnik's factories
pumped daily into the atmosphere, the sunrise was beautiful to her.  So, this
morning she came to watch... and to think.
     Paul heard footsteps on the platform behind him and groggily turned to see
who it was.  Soon, he was wide awake and at attention.  "S-Sally, I didn't,
um..."
     "It's okay, Paul.  Go home.  I'll be here for the rest of the time."
     "You sure?" he asked, still nervous.
     She chuckled.  "Yes.  Now scoot!"
     "Okay."
     Alone again, Sally settled down, hugging herself against the slight chill
of the morning air.  She looked out at the horizon, which was beginning to show
a faint glow.  The sunrise was near.  She began to think.
     I'm worried, she thought to herself.  What are the Freedom Fighters coming
to?  She sighed.  If this keeps up, there may not be any hope of ever defeating
Robotnik.
     Recently, Sonic had suggested that they allow more of the villagers who
wanted to become Freedom Fighters to train to do so.  Sally had been persuaded
by him, thinking that perhaps now was the time to have as many fighters as
possible, in case Robotnik grew more ambitious with his projects. 
Unfortunately, the results had not been quite what she had planned.  In the
last two weeks, her authority had been questioned, she had heard talking behind
her back on more than one occasion, and one mission had to be aborted because
of lack of cooperation.  On top of all that, she was even having to ward off
advances from one of the older squirrels in the community!
     She sighed and looked again at the horizon, which was glowing red just
above the mountains.  The sun would be rising any minute now.  What can be
done?  Sonic didn't seem to worry about it, as he was enjoying all the new
attention he was getting.  But she knew it couldn't continue like this.  One
more aborted mission, or one more refusal to cooperate, and Robotnik probably
wouldn't have to worry about defeating the Freedom Fighters; they would do it
themselves.  Eyes closed, she shook her head and sighed again.  What can be
done?
     The wind whipped through her hair, and she opened her eyes again.  There
was the sun, just beginning to appear, announcing that the night was over.  She
had to smile, even now.  It was as beautiful as she had remembered it.  Slowly,
as each minute passed, the sun climbed higher into the sky, red changing to a
brighter orange, and then an even brighter yellow.  Silently, the sun once
again started its daily journey across the sky.
     Memories of watching the sunrise with her father...  Memories of those
first bitter days after the coup, when he was gone...  The problems at hand now
that couldn't be ignored...  A tear came to her eye.  What can be done?
     "Yo, Sal!  Where are ya?"  The com-link startled her, seeming even louder
than normal as it interrupted her thoughts.  Reluctantly, she took it out of
its holster.
     "I'm okay, Sonic.  I'm at the watch-post."
     "Really?  Hey, want me to join ya?"
     "No, it's okay.  I'll be back at the village when the next watch starts."
     "Sal, are you okay?"
     "I'm fine, Sonic.  I'll see you in a few."
     "Well, okay..."  The channel stayed open for a moment more, but Sonic
finally switched it off.  She was alone once again.
     The trees were now illuminated, and she allowed herself to marvel at the
beauty that was the Great Forest.  Would they be able to protect the forest and
its inhabitants?  She hoped so.  Gods of Mobius, I truly hope so.
     She sat for a while longer, warmed by the morning sun.  Then, she looked
at Nicole's chronometer.  The next watch was soon to start.  Well, she thought,
I'm not going to get anything done sitting like this for too long.  She stood
up and stretched, then looked at the forest below.  There was Antoine, walking
slowly to the watch-post, ready to start his sentry duty.  Goodness, she
thought, chuckling.  He's actually on time.  She took out her com-link again
and signaled it.
     Sonic answered.  "Yeah, Sally, what's up?"
     "I'm on my way back, now.  Meet me at my hut.  We have a lot to talk
about, okay?"
     "Sure thing, Sal!  See ya there!"
     "Ah!  'Ello, mah Princezz!"
     Sally chuckled again.  She had a feeling they would work things out...
perhaps, even if it meant having to put some people back into their place. 
"Hello, Antoine.  Nice to see you're not late.  Anyway, I need to hurry back to
the village.  See you later."

     Yes, things would work out.  No more of this pointless bickering or these
destructive attitudes.  The Freedom Fighters would not be defeated by their own
actions.  She would see to that.

     A new day had begun.

---The End.

I agree, it would be nice if TV stations did this.  This happens FAR to 
much where I live, except it's for sporting events, (usually college 
football <ugh!>)  

	Sonic airs at 7:00 am there!  heh...consider yourself lucky...we 
only get the 'lame' version now and it comes on only once a week at -5am-!
