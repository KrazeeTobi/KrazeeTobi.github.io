I didn't know you'd done any "Trek" work -- cool!  I second the motion
concerning the animated series, if only because the Filmation animation
was so shoddy and flat no amount of classy writing could have saved it.

Yeah, I was wondering about that business with the sign myself.  Since
it couldn't be read in the final art I was left to wonder what kind of

I've made no secret about the fact that I've considered this to be an

Actually, you and Mike have already opened the door for some
"battle-hardened" Mobians: the cyborg freedom fighters alluded to at the
beginning of "Night of a Thousand Sonics" (#19).  This occurred to me
one day when "Life During Wartime" by Talking Heads came on the radio
and I found myself wondering if the Knothole gang had ever cranked it up
to that level of intensity.  I just couldn't picture it; the borg freedom
fighters, on the other hand....

I'll probably get my chance to check out #36 this week: the distributor
in this corner of Michigan doesn't drop off new issues until the first
Thursday of the month.  Am looking forward to the developments you
described.  And funny you should mention #17: I ordered that as a back
issue a while back in order to have the complete "Sally's Crusade."
Your description of what might have been included in the story had you
not confronted space limitations makes me wonder whether or not Archie
would issue a "director's cut" of a story such as "Sally's Crusade" in a
Digest format.  I know that that's probably asking too much, that it's
more economical to do a straight reprint.  Still, it sounds like a lot
of good stuff was left on the cutting room floor, as it were.

Thanks again for the reply.

Dan

Dan,

Not wishing to get off-topic, but DESPITE the shoddy animation, which really
was the BEST on TV at that point in time, it's the STORIES which determine
whether legitimacy should be conferred or not. Many of those stories on the
TREK animated series do warrant inclusion into the continuity, especially
YESTERYEAR, MORE TROUBLES MORE TRIBBLES and THE COUNTER-CLOCK INCIDENT. It
would be like trying to dismiss a legitimate SONIC story on the basis that
there was one aspect you didn't like.

As for stuff "ending up on the cutting room floor", as it were, you'd be
amazed at how many bits haven't been used in every story or changed because
of one reason or another. In fact, it's only recently that we're able to
develop the stories we can BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY ANIMATED SERIES to lead
the cart. I fully believe after working on the KNUCKLES mini-series recently
that if this were the situation when we did the PRINCESS SALLY mini-series,
at the very least the villain and the mission would have been allowed as
originally intended. I can't say more in case we can do that story in the
future.

BTW, I was wondering how come you hadn't commented on SONIC #36, good or bad,
just yet.

Ken

Actually, there have been several Sonic shows that were dismissed in
just that fashion: "Ro-Becca," "Ghost Busted," "Fed Up With Antoine."
Fan reaction when they aired was negative and immediate.  The "one
aspect" that tipped it in was probably Antoine -- personally, I always
thought the character too over the top to be believable, even as comic
relief.  And, of course, the daily syndicated series has long had low
credibility with Sonic fans -- at least, the ones who have spoken up on
this board.  Its vision of Mobius was so far out of character that it
was simply repudiated.  One or two guest characters may have registered,
but overall it feels like it's taking place on another planet. 

I guess we should count our blessings.  I'd forgotten that once upon a
time Filmation stuff was considered "best" because nobody else was
cranking anything out.  Nowadays Disney and Warner Bros. have
high-quality product all over the dial, and there's a host of innovative
series out there, from "Reboot" to MTV's excellent adaptation of "The
Maxx."  BTW, that's a nice phrase, "the continuity."

You confirmed my suspicion that the changes in the Princess Sally
miniseries -- changes that were only hinted at in the notice in the
Sonic-grams of Sonic #21 -- were quite substantial.  "The villian and
the mission"!  No wonder the cover art changed so drastically.  Hope you
get a chance to do your original story.  Not that there was a serious
problem with the story line that finally emerged, but I guess I have a
general curiosity about "what might have been."

Looking forward to FINALLY getting a chance to read #36 this weekend:

Ron B.,    
   You definitely made some serious points in that letter of yours. 
Here's some comments that I'd like to make...

>That rotten UPC symbol covered up part of Sally's cute tush!!!

Doesn't that just make you MAD?!

>I didn't quite get the discussion re. "The void" vs. "The zone of
silence"...

Me neither! I read that part OVER and OVER and OVER... what's with it?
I think... um... who wrote it... AAAAA!!! I LOST MY #36!!! Oh, man...

Well, although you made many other too true comments about the story,
I just have to say that basically I agree with you an all of them. One thing
that I'd like to add... whoever was writing this one (wish I knew) must've
either been trying to write a quickie to take up an issue or was up at
one o'clock in the morning with no coffee and didn't know what the heck
they were doing. Can't wait 'till #37, tho....

The difference between the zone and the void is a significant one. If it was
soooo easy to come and go from THE VOID, as we witnessed SONIC and ROBOTNIK
do in SONIC #30, then it stood to reason that King Acorn should have been
rescued a loooong time ago.

Therefore....

THE VOID was just another zone where it was believed King Acorn was located,
but actually as Rotor made clear, the King was really in the ZONE OF SILENCE.

Clear?

>The bottom of page 8 was a bit confusing; are we to infer that Robotnik 
kept that "photon cannon" going from the time of King Acorn's imprisonment 
until just now?<

The confusion for this stems from the drawing. Robotnik should have been
wearing his normal uniform, not his warlord uniform, indicating the breach
was a recent event.

>I'll leave comment on the ID of the masked rider to others, and/or until 
after another issue or two :^)  Though it _does_ conflict with the show...<

Sorry about that, but how do you know the show got it right, hmmm? Actually,
we never received scripts to every episode and sad to say, the second season
of SONIC was never shown on TV in my neck of the woods. Incidentally, my son
took me to task about the inconsistencies. However, by that time, SEGA had
already approved the story.

>Not sure why Dimitri had to hook up _sails_ to the island - didn't he have 
enough power to propel it himself?<

Sure he did, but he was being a bad guy at this time, see? And you can't
establish enslavement if HE does the work, can you?

>How could fire ants chew through the wall in so short a time?  (hours?)  
This seemed a bit deus ex machina to me...  Also that with all that power, 
Dimitri could apparently be crushed to death by the collapse of the tower 
(and it wasn't clear that the skull-like (shades of The Phantom?) Mt. Fate 
was created by its collapse).<

This was a case of limited space and a lot of material to cover. We felt any
cracks could be explained by the fans using their imaginations.

Er, I don't know that I'd go _that_ far, especially since the writer, Ken 
Penders, _does_ get the list you know (or maybe you didn't...)

>Can't wait 'till #37, tho....

Heh!  Kind of a non sequitur, but I agree :^)  And that might be a way to 
treat any "weaknesses" (there's probably a better term) in #36: they're 
necessary to the set-up of a multi-part epic...

Ah; it didn't help that his arm was shown as normal in the bottom four 
panels too, and even his hand was flesh-colored in the bottom left panel...
Even if it _had_ been drawn properly, a blurb in the narrative along the 
lines of "and everything was quiet until the other day when..." would have 
helped, but I guess that's just 20-20 hindsight...

change

In fact, I was writing according to the ABC SATURDAY MORNING SERIES BIBLE,
which clearly states that the King was trapped in the ZONE OF SILENCE, which
we referred to in issue #24. I can't help it if they changed the name during
the second season.

Besides, SONIC may be fast, but he can't switch zones all on his lonesome. At
the very least, he needs to collect some rings.

On the contrary, please feel free to express any and all opinions. This way
we know what  you really liked and disliked about the stories.

As for continuity, as I said, though we try, there may be some discrepencies.
I suggest you borrow a leaf from the TREK Fan's Guidebook. After all, they've
already spent 30 years trying to fill in the blanks.   :-)

Well, first of, this is off-topic but IMPORTANT, so read on:

Someone sent me 40+disks to copy Sonic PC for them.  I can't remember 
who! :(  I lost the adress, (darn mom's pop-cleaning,) but i DO know 
they were from germany.  Guy, are you out there?!? :)  I'm copying 
them now that i FINALLY have time, (sad but TRA-UE!)  Later all.

Oh yeah!  Expect to see a sweet character page up by this weekend!!! 
:)  It's looking very sweet.

later all.

I wish they would stick with one idea and stop changing the facts around.
You are right about the power ring through.  But one at a time is all he used
in the TV show.  He did use three to protect him self from the roboticizer once.

Ron,

If you can make a copy of second season episodes, I would be most indebted to
you, as I do make the effort to acquire any and all SONIC material in order
to keep the OFFICIAL continuity straight. Thanks.

Ken

Not at all. Some ants can strip a forest bare of anything green that lies
in their path in a matter of hours; it's not unreasonable that they can
disassemble a wall in short order.  To make a computer analogy, ants work
like parallel processors; each one is fairly weak by itself, but because
there are so many of them working as a coordinated unit, they have a great
combined power.

I find it curious that a whole 1/3 page was devoted to the fire ants in
part one of "A Sense of History" in #34, and one ant made a cameo appearance
on a leaf in part two.  The ants' world, the Mobian soil, was ripped apart
when the Floating Island rose into the air; I'd expect now they have a vested
interest in seeing it, and their various ant colonies, re-united.  So I
wouldn't be surprised if they don't play a pivotal role in the Knuckles'
mini-series.  And then in part three, a very similar scene (p. 5) with
Mount Fate collapsing, and Edmund & co. escaping (instead of the ants), just
has to make me wonder...

Another thing that struck my funny bone was Knuckles snapping his... 
knuckles?  I figure he must have fingers inside those mittens he wears,
like all the other echidnas we see.

That was clear enough to me.  But why would Mt. Fate be laughing at Knuckles
in the final panel of part 3?  Is somebody or something trapped within Mt.
Fate?  Is it Dimitri, biding his time for the chance to put an end to the
long line of Guardians of the Floating Island?

> Either this means Mobius is a future Earth,[...] or it was influenced by

My take on it is that Mobius is an alternate, present-day Earth.  Issues
raised by having a villain who despoils the planet, destroys forests and
wildlife, and enslaves the surviving population like robots (sounds like
some jobs I've had) in a technological dystopia, also apply to our world.
And then you have a small group of individuals, with Sonic at their helm,
who reject that future and who know they can change it.

> I still think the decision to dismantle their technological society was a

It shows that Echidna society were still masters of their own fate,
and they had the courage to correct a major mistake they realized
they had made.

> At least the UPC symbol will only cover part of her boots this time...

Odd how some of the early issues didn't have the UPC barcode on the cover.
I'm glad my Sonic mini-series #3 doesn't have it -- that Scott Shaw! cover
has to be an all-time classic!

    Well, guys, IMHO, the satAM series and the comics are TWO DIFFERENT
CONTINUITIES.  There's little or no way to reconcile the two...
especially since the comics goes through a standalone work to drawing
from the weekday series to drawing (thank heaven) inages and ideas fro,
the satAM one.  But the three venues are separate and equal.  (Well,
separate and equal except for the often hideous weekday series.)

    Acorn may well be trapped in the Crystal Void in the SatAM show, but
that's no guarantee that he's there in the comic.  Just as Ms. Rabbot
appeared originally in the comic but didn't appear in the show until the
ABC SatAM show was developed.  All separate, see?  Not requiring
desparate attemps to lock in canon.

    Actually, we have THREE canons-- the weekday show, the ABC SatAm
show, and the comic (which seems pretty much to draw from aspects of
both).  This boy's gonna treat each canon as separate.  Besides, in
"Night of 1000 Sonics" we know that there are LOTS of variances...
(I dealt with that somewhat in The Barbarian)  So SatAM is best regarded
on a track very close to the Comic track, but not identical.

    a rather opinionated rob

Ok, this is the entire scanned page from Diehard's March issue, when they

Yes it is Japanese, its the Sonic Anime.  As for right now, you can't get 
ahold of it unless you live in Japan.  It is still rental-only right now, 
but as of May 31st, Sega Enterprises will put the videos (of which there 
are two) up for sale, of course, this is only in Japan.  There are no 
plans yet for it to be released in the states.

Why on Earth would you want this dubbed?!!?  Sub-titling is definately 
the way the to go.  Leave the original dialogue as it is, any anime/manga 
fanatic will tell you that dubbed anime is absolutely horrific, Sonic is 
no exception to this rule.

To quote from the JPG itself (a scan from a magazine by the look of it):

-Sonic has made his Japanese animated debut, to remind us once again how
-much American cartoons suck.  The U.S. Sonic Saturday morning cartoon is
-long gone (I hope),

[Editorial comment: the opinions of this reviewer do not necessarily
reflect the views of the management of this email address.]

-but it would definitely still be around today if it was as good as its
-Japanese counterpart.  The Japanese Sonic is a rental-only OVA, (the
-first of hopefully many)

[For those of you not up on anime terminology, OVA = Original Video
Animation, i.e. something released directly to video instead of TV or a
theater.]

-so the animation is much cleaner than you could ever expect from a TV
-show, but the characters' on-screen presence is what makes this Sonic so
-cool.  It's like playing the game, but in anime form. Or something.

-Since it's only 27 minutes (part 1 of...?), there's not too much to say
-about Sonic.  Sonic and Tails are out to save the president, who's been
-kidnapped by arch-villain Dr. Eggman (Robotnik in the US version).  So,
-they run off to Eggworld, fight some minor enemies, fight a boss, meet
-Knuckles, and then Volume 1's over.  It doesn't sound like much, but it's
-a hell of a trip, and the pace is as fast as Sonic himself.  Though Sonic
-sounds a bit gruff, the voice actors are pretty cool, and the new
-character, Sarah (the president's daughter), is a nice addition to the
-cast.

-Slim though the possibility is, Sega might one day bring the series here,
-but until then, enjoy some shots of what a video game-based cartoon
-should be..."

BTW, the JPG is very good.  Anyone know which magazine it's from?

         Um--point here. The comics, as Ken has pointed out, are 
*approved* by SEGA, the makers of the game. Could the show make the same 
claim? Much as some may hate to admit it, the comic book, by most 
definitions can be considered 'canon', though there are some excellent 
fanfics, and the few TV eps I did get to see were great as well. This 
argument is kinda similar to people arguing over Diane Duane's Rihannsu 
as compared to 'canon' Romulans. ;-) BTW, where do you get off telling 
the *writer* of the comic what he can and can't do in his own series?

    Hi, I'm Thad "X" Boyd, a Sonic enthusiast, and a <sigh> former user of
this list.  I got kicked off back in January (if you REALLY wanna know the
vivid details, check the list archives), and didn't even know I HAD been
(being subscribed to another, EXTREMELY high-traffic list) until a few
weeks ago.
    But that's all in the past.  Now I'm back, and I PROMISE I won't lose
it again.  As for the present, I'd like to know how many of you out there
have read my stories, The Hunt Begins (thanks to Dave Pistone for
correcting his minor errors on this one), Jaded Views (thanks to Steve
Tramer for helping write it), Blue Flames (thanks to Brent Roberts; again,
I had a co-author), and The Bargain (my latest, which is only on my own
homepage), or have visited my page (http://pages.prodigy.com/Thad_X_Boyd/).
 Feedback is welcomed and encouraged (my stories can, I believe, be
discussed on the list, but feedback on my homepage should only be sent to ME).
    Finally, I'd like to announce some upcoming stories by my esteemed
colleague, Stephen Tramer, starting with The End of Innocence (Book 1 of
the 72 Hours Trilogy).  Look for them on my page first, and MAYBE on
Bookshire's, though I'm not sure about the latter (I don't know if they can
really be called "Sonic stories" as Robotnik makes only a couple brief
appearances and, so far as I've read, Sonic only appears in ONE LINE of the
whole trilogy).  I'm editting them, which, I might add, is NOT an easy
task.  Steve needs to learn the meaning of "proofreading" instead of
leaving the WHOLE THING to me...ah, but now I'm starting to get off-topic.
8(
    Anywayz, read my stories if you get the chance; stop by my page
whenever convenient, and tell me what you think!  Bye now...

Hi, Thad!  I remember you from way back when, and want to say,
"Welcome back to the Sonic mailing list!"  I've read three of your
stories: Jaded Views (Not impressed, sorry), Blue Flame (pretty cool),
and The Hunt Begins (very cool).  I remember you saying you did Jaded
Views and Blue Flame as kind of a lark, but I like it when you write more
serious stories like The Hunt Begins.

Anyway, welcome back!

We're getting a pentium this week, that means I can get a way cool Sonic

Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

Although I know everyone has been talking about this game
4 a VERY long time, I just got the latest issue of Game Players
magazine (I read and am subscribed to several mags) and it has
a World Exclusive (yeah right) review of Sonic for Saturn!

Just for those who haven't been able to get their hands on this
mag yet, I've decided to give some highlights of the
four-page (and what a sweet 4 it is) Sonic section...

[Sonic's new abilities:
SpinBash: A quick forward attack modified from the Spindash
SpinSlash: A mid-air, 360 degree attack
Ring Throwing: Just what you've always wanted Sonic to be able to do.

The Story-Line: Sonic Saves The Day

The new story intoduces two new characters - one, an old man named
Professor Gazebo Boobowski and the second, his daughter named
Tiara B. Neither character is playable in the game but they are both
well-represented in the game's cinematics and there is always the
possibilitiy of future involvement in later adventures.

(Just a little note from me, SUPER STH: Cinematics... YES!!! And
Tiara's a hot lookin' Hedgehog... uh oh, Sally...)

As with every great hero, Sonic's greatest joy in life comes from saving
his friends from the clutches of evil, and in Sonic X-Treme, very little
has changed! At the beginning of the game, we find Sonic doing a 
little surfing when he sees the Bluestreak distress signal in the sky.
The signal is coming from Professor Gazebo Boobowski and his daughter
Tiara B (Sonic in drag? You make the call). Keepers of the six magical
Rings of Order, and the castle wherein they practice the anchient art 
of ring smithing,

(Another note from me: THEY do ring smithing? But I thought Chuck
was the only one... hmmmmm....)

Boobowski and Tiara are in fear that Dr. Robotnik, Sonic's archnemesis
(duh), is after their precious rings. Dr. Robotnik has, at this point,
already
made one attempt at stealing the Rings of Order. It is determined that only
Sonic can fight off Robotnik's attempt and to do so, he will need to collect
the six rings himself. From there, Sonic sets off to gather the six magic
Rings of Order, battling Robotnik's Badniks along the way. Just another
say in the life of a super hedgehog.]

There is MUCH more to the article than this, so to those of you who are
interested (I would be if I was you), go to the store and buy it! 

P.S: It's real easy to find... it's got a big picture of Sonic on the cover.

There's two ways to fix this.
One. All of the freedom fighters grow an extra finger to be even with Sonic,
Tails and so on..
Two. Or Sonic and company lose a finger.

Its just odd to have some with three and some with four.

Him if Sonic and Sally have kids how many fingers will they have?

I just left the Sonic IRC.  The amount of people joining was rising, and
everything was going smoothly until all my incoming messages just stopped. 
I am rather impatient, so most likely if I waited just one more minute I
would've gotten all the messages.  Now all you guys on IRC know the reason
for my rather abrupt departure.  I was wondering if the time it takes a
message to get delivered differs with the time of day.  If so, we could set
up for an IRC session during a non peak hour of the day, say early in the
day on a weekend.  Any other suggestions?

Well, as I've explained in at least two of my stories (The Hunt Begins and
Jaded Views come to mind), there are several types of rings, including
Magic Rings, Power Rings, Teleportation Rings, and Kabuki's Jaded Ring (the
significance of which, for those who haven't figured it out, will be
revealed in my next story, Ground Zero).

Here's my two-cents' worth: I've noticed that the characters who appear in
the video games (with the obvious exception of Knuckles) have four fingers
(not counting thumbs) on each hand, whereas the others tend to have only
three.  To boot, I've noticed that on the package art for the first and
second Sonic Genesis games, Sonic's drawn with three fingers and a thumb on
each hand, whereas in Sonic 3, he apparently grew two extra fingers...

That's a big IF.  More like WHEN, not if.  Anyway, probably the same as
their parents'.

Mmmmmno.  See, one finger times two hands equals two fingers.

I recently went looking for Sonic-CD at Toys'R'Us, and noticed that
have stopped carrying it.  
As for the Sonic Screen-Saver needing a p5 cpu, I guess it just means
that it wants to run really, really fast!

Hi again . 

Today I have a few things to talk about :

1)My Archives
2)New Fan Fiction
3)A reply to that thing about a review on Sonic X-treme

1) My Archives

As you all know , I run the Sonic Fan Fiction Archives . To date this is
what I've recieved :

New Fan Fiction : 1
Votes for favorite fan fiction : 0
Decipher : 1

Both the things I've recieved came from the same person , the fan fiction
was forwarded to me from another person .

Anyway , I cannot believe that no one has completed any fan fics that have
NOT been posted on the net . Surely someone has something they want displayed .
I made this archive to create a place where authors can display their works
, but my archives seem to be turning into a showcase for my own fan fics
only ...
This only boils down to a few possibilities :

a) No one knows about my archives
b) No one can be bothered with my archives
c) No one has fan fiction
d) No one has completed any fan fiction recently 

All I can say is .... please...please (I'm grovelling here..) send me your
fan fiction . Without your support , there is no point to the Fan Fiction
Archives .
Perhaps as a start , those of you working on fan fics could let me know that
you are ? No details needed , just a sentence saying that you are working on
something and when it is expected to be completed . In advance ,
thankyouthankyouthankyou . :)
e-mail : prower@pacific.net.sg

2) New Fan Fiction 
Here it is : I've posted two new fan fictions to the Fan Fiction Archives .
One is written by me , the other is written by a Fred Richards , which was
forwarded to me by Kiken Enryu yesterday . 

Here's the description :

Tell Tale Hell  -  by Fred Richards

This story is set in the Robotnik era , and covers stuff about Packbell ,
under orders from Robotnik , experimenting to create a powerful biological
lifeform cum weapon . 

Power of the Mind  -  by me

This story continues from Tides of War , in the As the Wheel Turns series of
fan fics . It will tell of the efforts of the Council of the Federated Races
to find the traitor in it's ranks that had enabled Queen (and President)
Sally's capture by the forces of the Alliance of Races . What they find out
however seems impossible to believe ...

As before , you can also e-mail me for a personal copy of MY fanfics . If
you really cannot get the fanfics of others on my archive , send a note my
way , and I'll do what I can . Look for the e-mail address in my signature
below .

3) Reply

OK , now for the last part . 
The magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly's May issue (we just got it here in
Singapore , and I'm not sure how long ago it was released elsewhere ) had a
half page article on what they call " Super Sonic " , the working title for
the Sonic game on the Saturn . They say the release date is in Fall , it is
action themed , and is 25% complete . The game is in 3D , and will either be
rendered , like the arcade game , or polygon-based like the Sonic Fighting
Game . EGM also said that Sega would not comment further until the E3 trade
show . 

I've said my share .

That's all for now .

Later

Well , I've just taken a look at the two fan fics I was talkig about earlier . 
That will be the LAST time I try to upload a .doc document to the net .
Anyway , my apologies to Fred Richards and all who went there to find the
new fanfics prefixed with gibberish . I will be converting them to .txt
format , and they should be repaired within 24 hours . Once again , sorry !

Not to play net-cop or anything, but this list isn't for discussing Sonic

As all of you know, this list was recently engaged in quite a large
dispute concerning Sonic's age. Well, I'd just like to add to the 
confusion ;-) by saying this... although no one really pays attention
to the somewhat stupid Weekday Morning show that is now on 
USA, I was wondering... Sonic celebrated two birthdays on that 
show, didn't he? If so, would that effect Sonic's age at all?

Welllll, after reading all of the Knuckle's mini-stories, I have noticed
something (and I am sure that I am not the only one who has)... 
apparently no one could decide if the echidnas had four or three
fingers. However, judging by the most recent stories, I can guess
that they have three fingers... but the Knuckles Mini-Series issue #1
is sold out down here (AARRGGHH!! I WAITED FOR MONTHS AND 
DIDN'T GET ONE!!!!!!) and I never got to see it... man...

I have yet to notice that! But, that's retarded (KJH speak, adj: stupid)
that Sonic has  4 fingers and the rest have three.......what happened?
Robotnik severed 1 finger off of half of them????

And I'll second that too.  Discussion of a software package's system 
requirements is straying too far from this list's purpose.  If your 
system does not meet minimum requirements and this bothers you, please 
contact the software publisher directly.

The reason the screen saver needs a p5 and a double-speed CDROM is probably
because it plays back digital video clips. AHA!

[Smartaleck David Spade mode on].  It's called "Research."  Try it.
[SDS mode off]  I went back to the two instances where Sonic & Sally's
_kinder_ have made appearances: the conclusion of Sally's Crusade from
In Your Face #1, and the very beginning of "The Return" (Sonic #22).
Whereas Art Mawhinney gives Sonic & son 4 fingers, he gives Sally &
daughter only three fingers.  Pat Spaziante, OTOH, gives everybody four
fingers.

This settles nothing, of course, which is about par for such matters.

This showed up in rec.arts.comics.other-media, and I thought many of
its points were worth mentioning on the Sonic mailing list - I'm
getting tired of people posting in MIME/base 64 encoding, and/or
quoting people's _entire_ messages, including the .sigs.

      Heh--Sonic CD ported for PC. Any clue if they have an Amiga port of 
that anywhere? Might be an incentive to actually get a CD-ROM drive. ;-)

     This brings to mind something I've been pondering a while. In the 
games, we have all these rings all over the place just hanging there to 
be grabbed. In the cartoon, and many fanfics (not *quite* sure what 
Archie is planning to use as the ring origon) we have the rings made by 
Uncle Chuck (who, for a guy who's best known for his chili dogs, is 
apparently a super-genius physicist and engineer).
     The difference, and the solution, though, is fairly simple--the 
rings that occur in the zones are *Magic* rings, likely a by-product of 
the same source that produces the chaos emeralds (which are another whole 
ball of wax, considering that the games and such have only 12 emeralds (6 
regular and 6 'super'), but the fanfics and the comic have them by the 
truckloads. ;-) )--however, the ones made by Uncle Chuck are always 
called *Power* Rings...possibly an attempt to duplicate or harness magic 
rings? Anyway, that's my two Mobians on the subject...

Mike and I have had many, many discussions about this topic. Subsequently,
for everyone's sakes, we've decided to leave this one alone. If anyone asks,
we tell 'im the stork brought the kids and leave it at that.

Now, if you're willing to entertain the thought of in-vitro fertilization....

You have a point there, Meester.  According to Sonic #35, magic rings are
like a side path off the chaos emeralds.......and power rings are
made......somebody help me here, this  is so
confusing.......................

[more than the usual SPOILER protection]

























#36 [July 1996]
     Spaziante cover art -- the castle and carved gates don't
figure into the story, but who cares?  Another masterpiece.
     Heart of Darkness (3 parts)
     Story: Ken Penders; Art: Art Mawhinney
     HOYOTOHO!
     No, Rotor hasn't tuned into Bayreuth to watch the Flight of
the Valkyrie.  What he DOES have is a "live" remote from the
"Zone of Silence."  Isn't that the same thing as "The Void"? 
After about 5 panels of explanation, some of the readers of this
list still seem uncertain on this point.  All I know is, it bears
no resemblance to the Void featured in the TV ep of the same
name.  In any event, the fact that it isn't the Void is offered
up by Rotor as a way of explaining why previous attempts to
travel there and back again were so easy.  But in a more
important complication, there are serious power reading coming
from Robotropolis.  Sonic goes to investigate, and arrives to
find Snively at the controls of some kind of beam generator which
reminds me too much of the climax of "All Good Things...", the
final ep of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" (now that Ken
Penders has revealed himself to have worked on Star Trek comics
I'm keeping my copy of the _Star Trek Encyclopedia_ close at hand
to check for references, though the STE as a reference work
suffers from flaws that range from annoying to unforgivable.  But
I digress...).  Sonic arrives and takes the device out of
commission, and Robotnik congratulates him on endangering all of
Mobius.  Cue the flashback for Sonic's (and our) benefit: Seems
that when Robotnik took over eleven years ago, he wanted to use
the Zone of Silence developed by his "mentor" Kodos as a sort of
interdimensional concentration camp.  Unfortunately, once he sent
King Acorn there he realized that it was unstable and would
absorb Mobius.  Subjecting the thing to a steady stream from a
photon cannon managed to keep it in check, but with the cannon
destroyed by Sonic alternative measures have to be taken. 
Robotnik gives Sonic an "energy inhibitor" which bears a striking
resemblance to a household bug bomb.  He convinces Sonic to
detonate it within the Zone; despite serious reservations, Sonic,
Sally, Tails, and Antoine enter the Zone, which basically looks
like Space, The Final Frontier(tm).  There, they confront the
dark rider flanked by some characters who look like they belong
in a game of Doom.  Sonic dispatches these bit players, but
before the rider/knight/whatever can draw a bead on Sonic, Sally
intervenes.  In the struggle, she knocks off his helmet and
reveals him to be...what the heck, someone of the list has
already spilled the beans...King Acorn!!!  Or a reasonable
facsimile thereof.  Actually, he's not that reasonable, for he
gives Sally a quick jolt with his lance for her troubles.  In
response, Sonic detonates the bug bomb -- don't ask me what the
practical results were because they're never spelled out.  Rotor
manages to drag the Mobians back through the portal before they
overshoot it, and a shaken and subdued Sally is probably thinking
that now she knows how Luke Skywalker must have felt at the
end of "The Empire Strikes Back."  To be continued, somewhere
along the way.
     And to think it was only three issues ago that we were
witnesses to some of the lamest excuses for storytelling ever,
even for the medium of comic books.  The improvement, both in
terms of complexity and emotional impact, has been quantum. 
Major kudos for both artwork and story.
     So, does anyone besides me think that that WASN'T Sally's
father wearing that armor?  Not only did the Zone bear no
resemblance to the Void, but in the two TV eps where Sally and
her father were reunited ["Blast To The Past, Part 1" and "The
Void"] Sally's father didn't fail to recognize her.  That didn't
happen this time, which makes it all just a little too
unconvincing.  I'm also haunted by Robotnik's aside on page 9
about Sonic doing his "dirty work" for him.  It leaves me with
the strong impression that Robotnik knew precisely what effect
the bug bomb would have in the Zone.  So the question remains:
whom did Sonic destroy?  Possible candidates:
     A. the real King Acorn
     B. Kodos as King Acorn
     C. a parallel King Acorn (cf. "Night of a Thousand Sonics")
     D. None of the above
And judging from the effects of the bug bomb in the Zone, I feel
pretty safe in saying that whoever it was was destroyed when it
detonated.  Which has major consequences from Sally's point of
view: can she really feel close to the hedgehog who (she may
believe) assassinated her father?  I don't envy Ken Penders his
job: this story's opened some major pitfalls and trap doors, and
it's his burden to resolve matters plausibly (unlike the
conclusion to "Growing Pains").  Stay tuned; you can bet I will!
     "A Sense of History: Part 3"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders/Art: Ken Penders
     No wonder Ken P. has been waiting for this review!  Let's
recap the story to date: Dmitri has just used the "chaos siphon"
to trash eleven of the 12 Chaos Emeralds that hold up the
floating island.  He has taken his brother and some of the
leaders of echidna society prisoner.  He has already directed the
resident "mecha-nauts" to enslave the populace, and once the
island is equipped with sails he plans to similarly conquer the
rest of the planet.  In the midst of this raving, however, it
develops that his fortress Mt. Fate has been subverted from
within: the foundation has been eroded by fire ants and the place
starts collapsing.  The imprisoned echidnas escape and Dmitri is
buried beneath the rubble.  The Magistrate gratuitously quotes
from the Book of Proverbs and declares that Dmitri's end was as
much a result of the society's trust in science resulting in
hubris as it was Dmitri's own madness.  This led to a certain
overreaction as the echidnas destroyed their city and appointed a
guardian over the last remaining emerald.  Which, several
generations later, turns out to be Knuckles.
     So what's this all have to do with the plot?  (Remember the
plot?)  Knuckles suddenly starts putting it together: he
remembers the words "Grand Conserve" from issue #31(!) and
realizes that it refers to The Grand Conservatory, an underground
warehouse where artifacts of echidna society were stored.  He
believes that this is where Archimedes (remember him?) is hiding
out and where the missing Chaotix (remember them?) are being
held.  So, as Bill Cosby said in the course of one of his comedy
routines: "I told you that story to tell you this one."  And once
more quoting his father (who was apparently named George
Santayana) he reminds us of the plot and begins his segue to his
miniseries (conveniently advertised on the facing page).
     WHEW!  I know that this process took longer than
anticipated, what with the addition of three 2-pagers over the
course of three months, but Kanterovich & Penders came pretty
darn close to losing the audience there.  In any event, the ad
for the miniseries pretty well telegraphs the plot based on what
went before: Dmitri vs. Knuckles.  BTW, I wouldn't make too much
of the movie poster format.
     Sonic-Grams: Who was it that said "We buy the product so we
can read about Sonic and Tails, not Scott and Paul."  Oh, yeah,
it was me...in my review of #29.  Nice to know the Fredster is
willing to listen; by keeping the Blue Blur front and center in
the "office humor" section [drawn by Spaziante] he actually
managed to come up with something funny!  Senor Mendez limits
himself to less than 2 column inches of self-introduction before
going on to "what you really want to know: mainly Sonic the
Hedgehog!"  [By George, I think he's got it!]  Topics: the launch
of the Knuckles miniseries; a story titled "The Fall of
Robotropolis" by DeCesare and Thomas (after his debut in "To Bot
or Not To Bot" in #34); plus further developments on the King
Acorn plot set up by "Heart of Darkness."  Letters: Kim Wessels
of Des Moines agrees with Tails that it's rough being treated
like a kid.  In answer to a barrage of questions, the person
writing the replies pegs the birthdates of Sonic, Tails, and
Knuckles to the release dates of the Sonic 1, 2 and 3 games
respectively.  However, he punts the question as to whether the
TV series is still on the air -- this reply must have been locked
in months ago, before the USA Network picked up Sonic's option. 
And in a major concession to the comic's popularity, there's a
list of people who sent in letters and fan art that didn't get
published but who still might love seeing their names in print. 
Fred, I like your style!
     Spaziante cover art for #37 shows Sonic holding a
(lifeless?) Sally in his arms.  Is it possible for Spaziante NOT
to do a cool cover that involves Sally?  Looks like the train is
definitely back on the rails!  Double-bag this puppy!

     Hello everyone.  Does anyone know why that in Sonic #36 that it the comic runs a completely different storyline then the ABC cartoon used to be?  Now that the series is completely cancelled (which is sad) and the comic is the only Sonic the Hedgehog fandom that is still going, doesn't it still seems strange that Ken Penders is just rambling on in his scripts?

     There is also another mention to a Sonic the Hedgehog movie.  In the Sonic Grams section, someone sent a letter saying that it would be way past cool if there was a Sonic Movie.  The response was simply "I hope so.  It would be way, way past cool."  In the earlier issues, it made mentions that one might be in the works.  This doesn't seem to add to it though.  Anyone know anything about this?

This is in response to the question why does the comic's storyline differ
from that of the ABC show.  As much as I love the ABC Sonic, I don't
expect the Sonic comic to follow it.  Why not?  The comic and the ABC
cartoon are two separate continuities, always have been, always will be
(probably).  Why should the comic be just like the ABC cartoon?

Just my opinion.

ps-I would've quoted the message I'm replying to, but for some reason, elm
kept screwing up the word wrapping on it and I didn't feel like fixing it
manually.

Dan,

Two points regarding your review:

As I stated elsewhere, I was operating from the ABC Saturday Morning TV
series bible which stated King Acorn was trapped in something called the Zone
of Silence. I have always been consistent with this. Check back with SONIC
#24 as proof. Further, I also went on to state that I didn't have the luxury
of seeing either part of BLAST FROM THE PAST. I did have scripts to work
from, but I'm not sure if these were the final drafts or not. My son also
called me on the carpet for some (apparent) inconsistencies. All I can say,
issue #41 explains much and maintains continuity as established in the comic,
but it isn't until #43 that I re-establish continuity with the animated
series on some points.

One other thing: that is indeed the REAL King Acorn. You'll just have to wait
until #41 for the lowdown. (It was originally scheduled for #38.)

This may be adding fuel to the fire, but any hints about a SONIC movie from
Archie were based information we were getting about a possible SONIC movie.
In fact, Mike and I submitted a story where SONIC and the gang make a movie.
We were told to put this one on hold so we could add an official announcement
at the end. Maybe someday...

I'd object...except I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking
about!  

If it means my stories will have a wider audience, I'd like to go on
record as saying I don't object in the slightest!

Good point, E.  I'll include it in the FAQ File...as soon as someone
puts up something I can USE!  All the rumors began circulating because
of some "announcement" in a video games magazine.  The title may have
been mentioned a couple times, but that was all.  No article title, no
mention of the author, no date, no page number, zip!  I need solid
documentation before I'll believe anything like that.  Hey, if it's only
a 1-2 sentence blurb somewhere, is it that much work to quote it in full
instead of tying the BBS up in knots?

Hmmm.  You must be new here.  We talked about this earier this year.  I'm

According to Ken P's posts, while Archie's writers may be supplied with
scripts from the TV series, he himself had never seen any of the eps on
TV (which, in any event, might not have been finished or aired when the
story was in the Archie pipeline).  He also says that his 8-year-old son
is a major fan and kept him posted on the video developments.  I think
someone on the group offered to send him the 2nd season eps on tape for
his edification.  In any event, with the show in reruns and no new
eps in production, that pretty much frees up the forces at Archie to
take the story in their own direction.

I already made it clear that I found the whole business frustrating.
Nobody bothered to quote directly from the blurb that appeared in some
video gamers mag (quote plus as full citation as possible would have
been nice).  Instead the whole thing kicked into rumor mode.  Not cool.
I'm STILL waiting for someone to post a direct quote with citation for
inclusion in the FAQ File.

This is frustrating, as I sent the following e-mail in response regarding
this issue:

This may be adding fuel to the fire, but any hints about a SONIC movie from
Archie were based information we were getting about a possible SONIC movie.
In fact, Mike and I submitted a story where SONIC and the gang make a movie.
We were told to put this one on hold so we could add an official announcement
at the end. Maybe someday...

The problem is I keep receiving this message in response:

Sorry. Your message could not be delivered to:

s. fan club (The name was not found at the remote site. Check that the name
has been entered correctly.)

What is going on here? Hasn't anyone seen my last few posts? And if anyone
has an answer for me how to correct this, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

Et tu, Ken?

Near as I can tell, the original message must have been posted by
someone with the "s. fan club" designation in their address and repeated
replies to the message in the string keep running into the same
roadblock.  Your post about a suggested filmmaking storyline DID make it
through, I recall.  Best suggestion I can give: do a straight send to
the list rather than a reply.  That should start things over with a
clean string.

Then again I don't know all that much about computers; I just USE 'em!

I'd like to have the 26 shows of "Sonic" the SatAM Series,
willing to pay resonable price if they're in good quality.
Help

And I now see the point in Paul asking me to change the short version to work
with the Archie Comic.  (Unlike the majority of you, I don't read the
spoilers.)

Acorn getting amnesia's really put a crimp on things....<sigh>

Oh, well, it's a good excuse to re-do my comic anyway.

Anybody's got a pic of Nagus?  I think I'll use him in the remake.  As for
the origional comic, I don't know.  I don't think I can put it on my Furry
Archive....oh, well.

Of course, the origional Blood and Metal story is still on my page:

     Yes, I am new here.  I forgot to introduce myself in my message.  I'm sorry that I cannot be able to see the current conversation that is going or has already been explained.  But time will take that away.

     Anyways, has anyone seen Knuckle #1 yet?  I've just recently bought it and it looks alright.  The map near the end of it is a great addition to explaining the island.

I've been getting this message, too.  I've e-mailed Eric Shulman about it,
and he's trying to track down the problem.  Your posts have been getting
through to the list just fine.

I'm getting that, too.  And it's really pissing me off.  I just trash it as
soon as I see Mialer Daimon (however you spell it.)  Yes, Ken, I do see
this.  Anyway, this is getting a little off subject, so I'll leave it at that.

EXACTLY.  Oh, and FYI, there are *14* Emeralds in the games (15, counting
the Master Emerald), not just 12.  As for the thing about thousands of
Emeralds mentioned in the comix, that kinda stymied my ideas for a bit, but
I've worked out an explanation for THAT, too.  If I ever get around to
posting my interpretation of the early years of Mobius (a la The
Silmarillion, by JRR Tolkien), all will be revealed...

Consider this a formal request:

Whoever read the notice in the gaming magazine about a Sonic movie,
PLEASE post (either to me privately or to the board) what you read and
where you read it.  I want to incorporate it into a question for the FAQ
File and I can't do it until I have a direct quote with source footnote
(yeah, that boring term paper stuff).  Whoever posts the information
WILL be credited by name in the FAQ File.  Thank you.

*Smacks his forhead* D'oh.. I forgot: not everyone HAS that compression... I
know of the site: http://www.intel.com/pc-supp/mulitmed/indeo/#prod

And if anyone else wants that avi, i'd advise going to this site and
download the newest video compressors from Indeo. I got the Windows/Win95
zip of it.  I use this one now because it keeps alot of quality (less blocky
colors of red or blue like the old one) and doesnt take up as much space.

I tried that HTML, but no dice; I couldn't access it.  Maybe it's
misspelled?

Oh, and I downloaded the Video for Windows file that was recommended to me
twice.  Still no dice.  (I'm using Windows 3.1, BTB.)

Heh.. Well this is TASTEFUL. I mostly get disgusted at seeing the naughty 
bits being drawn in. And they were just kissing. :)
Hell, it was on a Saturday morning cartoon for crying out loud!
But I won't deny it, I do think Sally's kinda sexy! :)

It was compressed with "Intel Indeo". It's built right into Win95.
Try http://www.intel.com/pc-supp/multimed/indeo/
and try downloading the codec. It might seem like a lot of hassle to just 
play one movie, but this probably won't be the last one you see like this.

Now, you say you used Media Player.. In order to get that to play movies, you
would have had to install Video for Windows. Now I thought indeo came with
VFW. Maybe you have an old version? Or i'm mistaken in thinking it came with
it. :)

I was about to recompress it with Radius Cinepak, which is much more
compatible (especially since Quicktime also uses it), but it ended up being
over a meg bigger!

I'm posting this to the list to say this:
If you're using Win95, you can play funykis2.avi, you can only play it if 
you have the Intel Indeo codec.

Wow, talk about yer technobable. :-)

Hey!  I was wondering if anyone out there can get me a Sonic plush toy (for

mad!  Anyway, If you email me (dflinn@bcoe.butte.k12.ca.us), that would be
great!  Thanks a lot!

I have Win95, and I don't.  I just go into documents and unzip it, using

Just a post from your friendly neighboorhood Sonic chat operator.

As all of you #sonic frequent visitors have noticed, I have not been there
for the last few nights. I apologize to all of you, but my computer was
temporarily...indisposed. Okay, I can be a bit more blunt. I had a major
system crash and lost most of my files, and had to re-load my OS. But it's
okay now.

So, I'll be back on Monday night, if all goes well. 

To those of you who haven't visited the channel yet, I just want to know,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??? :)

Happy day to you.

            Sega's coming back to Sonic
                    in Force!!!

An Electronic Gaming Monthly report on the E3 confrence tells of a new
Sonic game coming for the _Genesis_ (I hope I hope!!)  I don't know
all the details, but I do know that it'll be called 'Sonic 3-D', is
expected to come out by Christmas, and will have a 3/4 perspective a
la Mario RPG.

I'll be scanning the article in for rat.org and be hanging on to my
16-bitter!  I don't think that Sega's done with the Genesis yet!!

Oh, and do you know that Saturns got _three_ 32-bit processors?
That's *96* bits there!!  (3-by-32--remember the Turbo Graphix 16?
Really a 2-by-8?)  What's Nintendo's mystery system got?  A lowly
1-by-64?  That processor'll be having strokes by the time I'm done
with it...and it'll *still* play that pond scum plummer!!

Well, the IRC interface at the University of Washington is pretty sucky,
and not always available.  That's *my* main reason.

Sender: owner-sonic@bort.mv.net

Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

     Several people have written to me recently and told me that the IRC
servers that are listed on the Sonic Chat pages on rat.org do not work for
them. I realize that this has been a problem for some of you, and I've been
working on a longer list of EFNet servers, which will hopefully be done
shortly. As soon as it's finished, it will be uploaded to Ratman and he will
update the Sonic IRC pages. Having a larger list of servers to try will
increase the probability that one of them will actually work for you.
     I apologize for taking so long with this, but the list of servers that
was sent to me by a #sonic user (I can't remember who it was. Whoever it
was, THANK YOU!) has over 200 servers located in countries all over the
world. I have to go through them and weed out SOME of them. I can't post a
20-page long list of servers on the Web; it would be impossible to find
anything...unless I get creative somehow. (Hmmmm....) 
     At any rate, I will be done soon, as in the next couple of weeks. Those
of you who are having problems such as these, please wait until I get the
server list updated and then try your luck again. I will make another post
to the list when the pages are updated, specifying what has been changed. 
     If you're having any problems other than this one, please E-mail me and
I'll help you. That's what I'm here for...

No. I am MilesProw on the channel. Sorry for not making that clear. I keep
forgetting that there are new people on the list, with more coming all the

Spoiler protection (I'm required to do this, ya know)












I just got my copy of Sonic #37 today, and it is definitely way past cool!
 The actual cover looks so much better than the preview (but then, has there
ever been a Spaz cover that hasn't been awesome?).  I'd scan it for you guys
if I had a color scanner-unfortunately, I don't.  Oh well.  =)
Anyways, the two stories are cool, although I have to admit that the Freedom
Fighters do look too cute in the first one (I forget the artist's name, and I
don't have my copy right here).  Despite that, though, it's still exciting.
 The Bunnie solo is pretty good; I take this as an indicator that we are
going to be seeing more of Bunnie soon.  Also, in the Sonic-Grams, they had
yet another teaser about Mecha Madness.  This one, however, told a little bit
more: it will have a lead-up story in Sonic #39, and it will feature the
"real" Mecha-Sonic.  I'm not quite sure what that means yet, but it sounds
good!  
Looking forward to #38!  ;-)

Is there any channal that shows re-runs?  
The comic any good? Is it the same one that was in Sega Vishions for a while?

I'm working on a fanfic, and 'cause I havent seen all the eps, I'm not clear
on some things.
First, does anyone use solid projectile weapons (guns that use bullets),
or all they all beam waepons?
What is the actual scientific porcess for (sp?)robotazation?
How much of Mobious(sp?) does Robotnic control (pre-doomsday)?
Is Packbell an actual char, or is that just fanfic?
Is Sandra Nightweaver an actual chat, or is that just fanfic?
Does Nicole have a solid-hologram generated body, or is that fanfic?

This next question dosnt have anything to do with my writing fanfic, Im just
curious..
  Am I missing something from the plot line? I dont understand the point of
having nothing but power plants and factories and no life on a planet.
Wheres the fun in haveing nothing but robot slaves? One possable answere is
that Robotnik is compleatly insain.

Somebody have an asnwere to this?

Well, I haven't heard anyone discuss the first issue of the KNUCKLES'
mini-series. So if you're looking for a topic, here's your chance. And just
to clue you in, if enough of you show your support with your cards and
letters as well as buying the book, who knows, you may get to see your
favorite echidna on a regular basis.

Go to http:/rat.org/sonic/irc and you'll find everything that you need to
know. Or you can follow the 'IRC' link on the sonic resource page.

Remember everybody, no posts to the list about chat. In the future, I will
ignore all of them. (I'm not mad, so don't feel bad about it. Just direct
all questions to me personally in the future.)

Hi, everybody!

This is MilesProw, and I'm just posting to the list to tell everybody that
the Sonic IRC pages have been updated. 

I added a VERY large list of servers. It's in plain text format, instead of
an html file, so you can save it and view it with ease if you want. The
listing has servers listed by country, and then by state if you're in the
US. Follow the link on the Sonic IRC main page to 'What IRC network is it
on?' and you'll be all set. As always, if you have any problems, just send
me an e-mail. 

I'd also appreciate it if everybody would re-read the Channel Information
Page. I've updated this, and it spells out the channel policies in a bit
more detail. We've been having some problems on #sonic recently, not the
least of which have been takeovers and harassment, so this page spells out
the consequences of stupidity. Any questions or comments, please let me know.

Once more, please do not post questions to the list. 

Thanks, everybody! I hope to see you on the channel soon.

There are two Sonic cartoons.  The former Saturday morning one (the good
one) is on the USA network on Sundays at 9:30am.  The other one is on USA
on weekday mornings (I'm not sure of the time).

> The comic any good?  The Archie comic varies in quality from issue to
issue, though the last few issues have been pretty good.  It's somewhere
between the weekday and Saturday Sonic cartoons in terms of seriousness of
writing.

> Is it the same one that was in Sega Visions for a while?

I have no idea.

I can't recall anyone using projectile weapons in any of the cartoon eps.
The only "solid projectile" weapons I know of anyone using were slingshots
and paint balls used by Princess Sally and the Freedom Fighters to blind
the Swatbots in the Princess Sally Miniseries.

> What is the actual scientific process for (sp?)robotization?

No one really knows.  However, Dan Drazen puts forth a good hypothesis in
the fanfic "Bloodlines" (available at http://rat.org)

> How much of Mobious(sp?) does Robotnic control (pre-doomsday)?

During the TV ep "Blast to the Past", I believe that Snivley mentions that
"90% of the population has been captured and is awaiting robotization".

> Is Packbell an actual char, or is that just fanfic?
> Is Sandra Nightweaver an actual chat, or is that just fanfic?

All of the above are only in fanfic.

I think it's a foregone conclusion that Robotnik's nuts.  Anyway, perhaps
he's so busy roboticizing people that he hasn't thought about what it
would be like to rule a planet with no one but robot slaves.

As official keeper of the FAQ File and unofficial old man on the list,
allow me:
> 
> Is there any channal that shows re-runs?

Practically every cable station reruns programs *ad nauseum.*  However,
if it's Sonic reruns you're interested in, they're being shown on the
USA Network (Sundays, 9:30AM Eastern; M-F 8:00 AM Eastern for the
syndicated show).

> The comic any good? Is it the same one that was in Sega Vishions for a while?
>

It's gotten way better over the last few months.  Kanterovich & Penders
have had scripts done that more closely correspond to the show.

> I'm working on a fanfic, and 'cause I havent seen all the eps, I'm not clear
> on some things.
> First, does anyone use solid projectile weapons (guns that use bullets),
> or all they all beam waepons?

So far, no use of projectile weaponry.

> What is the actual scientific porcess for (sp?)robotazation?

Debatable.  Some seem to favor a nanite-based technology while I prefer
to think of it in terms of a biomechanical synthesis.  And if I have to
explain any of this further, you may be in over your head ;-).

> How much of Mobious(sp?) does Robotnic control (pre-doomsday)?

Debatable.  Not all of Mobius has been mapped out, described and its
inhabitants named, for one thing.  Let's say he's taking care of the
easy stuff first, and that the Great Forest ain't easy.

> Is Packbell an actual char, or is that just fanfic?

Fanfic, a creation of Dave Pistone.

> Is Sandra Nightweaver an actual chat, or is that just fanfic?

Also fanfic.

> Does Nicole have a solid-hologram generated body, or is that fanfic?

Not fanfic; in several eps, Nicole has generated holo images.

You hear about the power plants and factories because they're the
preferred targets for the freedom fighters to hit.  They don't go in for
frontal assaults, preferring a strategy of hit-and-run.

Alternative answer: you hear about the power plants and factories because
a) Robotnik relies on them to further his conquest of Mobius; b) the
pollution generated by same isn't doing Mobius any good.  As for
Robotnik's insanity -- let's just say that, like a lot of dictators, he
has trouble thinking things through.

Just my $.02:

This seems like an interesting topic . Let's forget for a second that we're
all pro-Sonic , and think a bit like Robotnik . You've just usurped control
of a planet and sent it's rightful ruler into the Void . Now , it would be
obvious that the planet's population would revolt if some measures were not
taken to control them . So , what better way than to roboticize the whole
lot ? According to some , over 90% of the population have been roboticized .
Just think , the remaining 10% , esp. the Freedom Fighters are already
causing trouble for Robotnik , what if he had allowed the entire population
too remain sentient ? I would think that roboticizing an entire population
would not be fun , but it sure is a great tactical move . 

If Robotnik had not roboticized the inhabitants of Mobius , he wouldn't have
stayed ruler of Mobius as long as he did .

That's my opinion . Anyone agree with me ?

I took the above question to mean "Can Nicole take on any forms beside
that of a handheld computer?"  That is, can she morph?  That's something
I've seen her do only in fanfic.

Possible answer? HAH! I would've agreed to that without a 
single solitary second thought! If he was sane, wouldn't he
have realized by now that there's no way that he's gonna
win Mobius over?
Let's just leave it at this... the big round guy is a loon. Just take
Earth for an example... remember the dudes in the past that tried
to rule it? Remember how it seemed like they would forever be

I recently made it so the list says it's from lists.mv.net.
However, in doing this it prevents it from being able to detect that it's 
the same addess as listname@bort.mv.net, so if somone makes a post like 
this:

to: listname@lists.mv.net
cc: listname@bort.mv.net

it will post it twice!!

So please, if you reply to a post, and it puts both of those addresses,
delete the "bort" one, ok? Otherwise it will annoy us all to no end. ;)

This will not be a problem once people stop using the bort address for 
posts. The reason this happens, is because if someone posts to 
listname@bort.mv.net, it will send it to the list as "to: 
listname@bort.mv.net" and "reply-to: listname@lists.mv.net" and mail 
programs will see that and try to write to both addresses.
If you don't understand that, don't worry about it, just make sure you're 
not writing to both addresses in your mail program.

Get comfortable fans of Mobius..this is a something of a lengthy but
worthwhile post. :)

> What is the actual scientific porcess for (sp?)robotazation?

>Debatable.  Some seem to favor a nanite-based technology while I prefer
to think of it in terms of a biomechanical synthesis.  And if I have to
explain any of this further, you may be in over your head ;-).

I've been a subscriber to this list for quite sometime, and a very occasional
poster, and since I don't always have the time to read every message, I was
wondering if the following hypothesis was ever introduced and just slipped by
me in some quick scanning and deletions of unread mail. That said hypothesis
being thus: The scientific process for robotization being based upon neither
nanites or biomechanical synthesis, (unless I'm misinterpreting what is meant
by that) but upon *other dimension energy conversion*. Consider the following
facts that we know from the ABC show (which in my own humble opinion, seem to
offer the most logic that I would take it for the most part to be canon over
the comic for specific points, like UC operating a Chili dog stand. Yeesh.
<G>) : 1) We learned that Uncle Chuck was the inventor of the Robotisizor,
having invented it with the noble goal of using it to help Mobians live
longer. More than likely, this goal was something of a parallel to
"cryogenics" over here, wherin as people grow older and are more susceptable
to disease and frailty, (or even with younger people, infants, children etc
who are unfortunately afflicted) such frailty and disease could be "frozen"
by the conversion, until a cure could be found for such dibilitating ailments
wherein the subject would then be derobotisized and treated. A definate
improvement over such an idea as cryogenics since one isn't "asleep" all that
time. 

The problem though, as UC found, was the treatment took away the subject's
free will so that either the subject was either nothing more than a mindless
zombie (unknowing most probably that the "test subjects",-most probably lab
animals of somesort, despite  the anthromorphic nature of most beings on
Mobius. The process would have to be tested on creatures with measurable
intelligence-were, as he later discovered from his own first hand experience,
awake and alert but just unable to interact), a "vegetable" of sorts where
the subject was for all measurable respects "dead", or a different type of
mindless zombie yet one that like a person under hypnosis, would do any
instruction that was asked of him or her. As a scientist and compassionate
hedgehog who respects the mind, which is in effect, the *life* of any
sentient creature, to put any subject under such a treatment until a cure can
be found for whatever ailment they have, even for a short time, is an
abomination of an idea to UC and the project was either scrapped or tabled
indefinately until such bugs in the system could be fixed (I know this is all
common knoledge thus far, but there's a point to it which will follow in a
moment. Please bear with me). 

Now as to *how* Robotization works, that I believe comes from a critical clue
that we got from the episode "The Void". Fact 1) We know that again, UC is a
scientist and a great inventor. He was the one that invented the power ring
generator for Sonic to use (and which *only* the blue blur can use. I have
developed a working theory on why this is as well, but I don't want to use
this to take *too* long, so I'll cut to the chase. Interested parties about
my musings may e-mail me directly). Now, the Powerstone which is what
actually creates the Power Rings, we know, is very similar in its energy
configuration to that of the Deep Power Stones which caused Robotnik's defeat
in "The Doomsday Project". Therefore, for UC to have discovered how to adapt
this power source (which falls in again with my unsaid working theory there)
for use, and the fact that he created the Robotisizor, one could conclude
that UC is very knoledgable in the workings of wave field energy. Using this
conclusion, I have hypothesized thusly: 

1) We know that there are other dimensions than the one Mobius is in, like
the Void, that can be accessed via either science or sorcery. 2) Taking a
look at The Void, we saw that an unfortunate side effect from prolonged
exposure, upon subjecting a person from that unstudied dimension to another
dimension, his or her home dimension or another (King Acorn for ex:, who went
from The Void, back over to Mobius) was the transmutation of living matter
into perhaps an unliving state of matter, or perhaps a living state of
matter, but an unmobile one. (Being that we as well as Sonic and co, do not
know even the slightest bit about the workings of the Void, save that it can
be manipulated through magic, one could not really jump to the conclusion
that were Nagus and King Acorn's transmutation allowed to take place fully,
that their crystalline state would be a dead form of matter. After all, as it
is hypothisized that *silicon* based life forms could exist on other planets,
why not crystalline lifeforms from another dimension? Now, jumping right back
to that idea of silicon based life, seeing that exposure to another dimension
could in effect, "infuse" a subject with the energies inherit in that
dimension, a process that would only be noticeable, or perhaps just more
*quickly* noticable by passage *from* that dimension, why could not the same
be said for the process of the Robotisizor? 
What I believe happened, is that UC, in his studies of other wave field
energies that existed in other dimensions (through an again much longer
synopsis of how these events took place sequentially), saw that the energies
in shall we say Dimension R (for Robotization, natch) was able to transmute
all living matter into its silicon and metal equivilant (One could wager a
guess that perhaps silicon based life was the prominent or only life form
present in that dimension, if sentient life was present at all). After all,
matter, living or non, is simply *energy*, and as has been hypothesized by
Gene Roddenbery and others, if a way could be found to turn matter into
energy and back again (Transporter Technology) in Star Trek, then its
entirely plausible that from exposure to another dimension, the energy of
one's body could be infused for "adaptation", and transmuted, so that the
body of the subject would be able to survive in any given medium. 
In The Void and Dimension R, this effect would not be redilly noticable as
infusion is enough of an adaptation since the energy of the dimension is all
about the subject. However, *remove* that subject from all that available
energy, (bringing Nagus and Acorn to Mobius) and what energy (perhaps both
the Void and Dimension R energies are *sentient* energies of some sort,) is
inherent in the subject, is either forced to quickly adapt to maintain its
survival by overwhelming and transmutating the living matter it has entered
(sort of like the Vaccum effect in nature. There was no Void energy in Nagus
and Acorn when they entered the dimension, so nature sought to "fill" that
vaccum) and/or it could be that as Nagus suppossed, (since even he knew very
little about The Void) in the Void only his magics kept the transformation in
check, and that outside of "Sanctuary", even with his magic, that Void energy
was powerful enough to run amok and transform them, the Void energy going
from something of a symbiotic nature (since Naugus could control it in The
Void) to a parasitic nature on Mobius where it was too powerful for him. 

A very close movie parallel could be seen in either version of "The Fly"
wherin the scientist's DNA was simply "written over". Recent examples in Star
Trek Voyager could be given as well when Tom Paris entered that place (which
perhaps could be seen as another dimension, after all, isn't subspace in a
sense?) beyond Warp 9.999etc and had *his* dna written over as well. 
Now, that covers my ideas on Robotization, but getting back to the point a
few paragraphs previous with Uncle Chuck and his scrapping the project since
it took away a subject's free will, there's one more important point to
hypothysize upon. If the subject's free will was taken away, to the point
that the subject would do anything asked of him/her, which is the only
logical conclusion, since that "vegetable" bit UC found out to be untrue as
he was the first one changed, then why is it that only Robotnik is able to
control those Robotisized? Simple (sort of). As we know, Robotnik "stole" the
plans for the Robotisizor. Beyond being in charge of the Military (Again, a
timeline has been set up through the pondering of myself and some friends,
that explains the connection this has with his being a scientist), we know
that Robotnik is a brilliant scientist and inventor. We know that he knew
about other dimensions as well, since he worked with Naugus in studying The
Void before Naugus decided to go through to see what was there firsthand.
Now, knowing a great deal about Robotics, and electronic pathways, ie:
artificial intelligence shown in his Swat Bots and other bots, then what I
believe he did was after studying the Robotisizor, all that he saw he had to
do was to develop a program which as the subject was robotisized, would
program one simple order into the subject's now electronic pathway laid
"brain". That order being:, "Obey only him and Snivley", (though *him* first
and foremost should Snively try a coup) Again, sort of like hypnotizing a
person and putting a "conditioned reflex" into them, one that they could not
resist no matter what. The rest of the orders as they came up, "Freedom
Fighters are the enemy, No 1 Priority Hedgehog" and such, would be a simple
matter to "install" since having told them to "obey" his every whim, all he
would have to do is broadcast his desire, ie: Attack FF on sight" or whoever,
even if they were members of the subjects own family, and that conditioned
reflex would automatically kick in, storing that dictum for future
"automatic" use, thus making the subject helpless to his or her own actions,
and those non robotisized, unable to reach them. As the FF don't know how
this program works, they have no feasible way of reaching the minds of those
robotisized to stop them or help them. I know that Uncle Chuck is the
veritable "hypothysis hole big enough to drive a mack truck through <G>",
 being that he was able to overcome his "programming", both losing his free
will, and the orders that Robotnik imposed upon him, but again, I have
reasoned that out logically as well. However, that explanation is a slightly
lengthy one, involving The powerstone, (since powerrings were used to restore
his memory, something which has only worked with UC since the FF have never
used this trick on any other poor robotisized soul) so as this explanation
has already gone on for a good length of time, I'll just leave the option
open that those who are interested can e-mail me, or, if enough parties are
interested, I'll post the explanation here. 

> Does Nicole have a solid-hologram generated body, or is that fanfic?

Not fanfic; in several eps, Nicole has generated holo images.

Yes, but those have always been transparencies, and never of living things.
Well to be more precise, never of *life* size living things that could be
mistaken for "real" since she did project Sally and Bunnie being captured by
Naugus in the ep "The Void". Not to dictate what is and isn't in Nicole's
ability to anyone who writes, but in my opinion, if it were, then wouldn't
she have used that trick by now on the Swat Bots to distract them, perhaps
disable them, and to interact with the FF before now? Nicole's solid-hologram
generated body, to my knoledge, was first used in fanfic by a Sonic writer by
the name of Prin Sal1 who used to be on America On Line, unless she first saw
that adaptation of Nicole from another writer and used it for her own
writings that I was unaware of. My own belief is that seeing the solid
hologram "doctor" on Star Trek Voyager, she incorporated that holo technology
into Nicole. After all, solid holos need magnetic wave field generators, and
I don't think that Nicole has any of those built into her either or again,
she would have told Sally about them by now for her practical usage.

>Alternative answer: you hear about the power plants and factories because
a) Robotnik relies on them to further his conquest of Mobius; b) the
pollution generated by same isn't doing Mobius any good.  As for
Robotnik's insanity -- let's just say that, like a lot of dictators, he
has trouble thinking things through.

Not to mention the fact that as it has been said, not all that much of Mobius
has been charted to our knoledge, for which all that tech which Robotnik is
building up, could be used to spread his dominion over the planet as was just
said above. Another feasible option is that as Robotnik does have the ability
for space travel it could be reasoned, as he has the tech to launch objects
into space or at the least low orbit (as we saw with the "Sky Spy" in season
one), then its conceivable that Robotnik has plans to go conquer other
habitable planets to add to his dominion, once his factories have created the
necessary amount of technology and machinery needed. Is anyone out there
knoledable with Superman canon and the stories of "Warword"? (Think Death
Star for a close parallel if you don't.) If you do, then you can see what I'm
driving at as a possibility. Or it could be that he *is* just plain crackers.

Mobius, and few places to put it? )

to add their links to my page,please send me e-mail...
I have a guestbook,a counter,any other suggestion guys?
I need your help to improve my page..OK!

--------Have you seen to Knuckles?He escaped from me again!----------|

Good job, we have a topic now!  Your first question's already had
undisputable answers, so on to the continuity questions...

>First, does anyone use solid projectile weapons (guns that use bullets),
>or all they all beam waepons?

Hard to say.  Plasma could be considered somewhere in-between beams and
solids.  The Freedom Fighters, on the other hand, haven't (to my
remembrance) used any weapons on the cartoon, and in the comic have only
used (relatively) primitive ones.

>What is the actual scientific porcess for (sp?)robotazation?

I'd say it certainly involves the goal of ancient alchemists -- to be able
to transform any type of matter into any other.

>How much of Mobious(sp?) does Robotnic control (pre-doomsday)?

Well, the "90%" answer has been given, but we know for sure that, at the
time, he didn't know about the existence of the Floating Island, so it's
possible he didn't know about other hidden societies...

(Skipping over next three questions, as they've been answered)

Finally, regarding Robotnik's motives...nobody knows for sure, though I DO
believe it's a variety of reasons.  First off, I'd DEFINITELY agree that
he's a sadistic psychopath.  Second, he could be trying to prove something
to former colleagues (a deduction that MIGHT be made from his taunting
letter in The Hunt Begins).  Third, as someone's said, once he got rid of
King Acorn, he couldn't leave subjects to revolt against him.  Fourth, he
could be practicing on "inferior" beings for a takeover on another planet.
Finally is the (extremely unlikely) possibility that he's not even doing it
of his own accord, but is following orders from something more sinister.
Of all these, I'd say only 1 and 3 truly follow from the given information;
2 being a remote possibility; 4 & 5 being just musings.

Wow, what a lengthy description!
Well it is pretty interesting how it all falls into place. But I wanted to
know is, now that Sally ((supposedly)) can use Power Rings, was it because
of the sudden boost of energy vamped into her body by the power stones, or
was it magic?
>>Nicole, is she really capaple of indapendant thought? NickTheRat.aol@.com<<
((me people, its my AOL account)) I have a story out called Tell Tale Hell,
and its main focus is about a living machine, a machine who can think and
repair its self. I had pondered many beginings about how he would become
sentient, but I never explained that in the story. So for all of you
confused people out there ((who read it)) I will atempt to explain what
happens.
When Robotnik installed Nicks underdeveloped AI system, Iggy. ((which was
made from the brain of a Freedom Fighter)) some of the Freedom Fighter
instincs of escape and fight was rubbed off into his programming. By now
his systems were being programmed to eleminate the FF's. But a freak act of
humanization occured and Nick litterly ignored the commands, but did accept
Iggys Escape and Fight instincts. And then the story continues from my
story. Well ill try my best to set up more of a story line in the next TTH
series Knee Deep In The Dead.
See ya Mobians later

I have heard this question many times before, and I assume
that most of you have as well. It's a good one, thought up by
fanfic basically, and does deserve some thinking through. I
had pondered this somewhat, but then let it go to the back
of my mind... until now.
I just read Knuckles mini-series #1, and when I saw Enerjak,
Egyptians instantly popped into my head. Think about it...
the egyptian culture was very advanced for it's time, the most
advanced in fact, and is still thought to be quite incredible. Thus,
I assume that Knuckles' culture represents the Egyptians. 
Also, you all know about the rumors that anchient Egyptian
treasures are guarded (of course, the guard would be
dubbed the obvous title of guardian)... it all seems to fit in.
Most of you have probably realized this by now, 
but I feel that this would be an interesting subject nonetheless.
Now another question arises... where are the other alternate
cultures?

SUPER STH@aol.com

Knuckles : "So -- you're the big mahmba-jahmba... Archimedes!"
Archimedes (pointing to Knuckles) : "Look -- he's trying to think!"

P.S.: Who else instantly thought of Stargate when they saw Enerjak?

2 kinda progectile weapons ive seen in the show were the folowing
In the episode "Sonic Racer" Sally used a flare gun to signal Sonic 
<well, itsa weapon sorta>
In the episode  craqp I forgot, Iust watched it about 20 minutes ago, 
Sally puts Nicole on zap mode to break Sonic and her chains.

Ashura
Ive been taping Sonic episodes since 10:00 AM!!!! I managed to take 
my 5 tapes full of commercials and 2 tapes of my friends and get 20 
eps!!!!

Hello, this is MilesProw, the head operator on #sonic. I am not currently in
the greatest of moods, as I had hoped to avoid having to make an
announcement like this one. If you are a #sonic channel visitor, or ever
plan to visit in the future, then READ THIS NOTICE.

In recent nights, we have had numerous problems on #sonic. I am not speaking
of technical problems, but more of problems with some of you, the users.

I have had SEVERAL people come to the channel claiming to be me, who have
attempted to get op status. I've already dealt with several of the
perpetrators personally, and I think I have been much more than fair in this
regard. However, I'm getting sick of it. In the future, if anyone claims to
be me, you will be banned from the channel at all times while I am there. I
don't care if you were intending to take the channel over or just wanted to
say to your pals, "Hey, I had op status last night!" Claiming to be me(Or
any of the other ops) will be treated as a very serious offense, no matter
what you intended to do once someone else opped you. No more cutesy-poo
warnings and second chances. I suggest you don't screw up the first time
around from now on.

There have also been problems with takeover attempts, some of them
successful, on #sonic. This is due to the fact that, despite my warnings on
the Sonic IRC pages, everyone is being opped. As I said in the Web pages,
opping everybody, including people you don't even KNOW is a very bad idea,
as takeovers, bans, and general chaos are usually the result. As I said in
the Web pages, (Notice I keep saying this. Some of you obviously haven't
read them contrary to my advice to do so.) no one is to be opped except for
the channel operators, which include Mighty, Jaybird, ^Speed^, and
myself(MilesProw). If you get to the channel first and gain op status, then
wait until one of the operators arrives and op them. Do not op anyone else,
even if you know them. (More on this later.) Your op status will be revoked
once one of the operators has arrived, without any need for explanation, as
you are not entitled to it simply because you were there first. Handing over
control of the channel without question will reflect favorably upon you.

About opping people, don't ever op on Nickname alone. You MUST view
someone's User@Host information by doing a /whois on them, by using mIRC's
UCentral function, or by viewing the gobblediegook that appears next to a
person's name when they enter the channel. This information is very
difficult to fake (For most people), and should be used to determine if
someone is actually who they claim to be. For example, Jaybird's User@host
information reads: sonic2@cs1-02.lfd.ptd.net at least some of the time. (The
part that reads csl-02 usually changes from session to session.) But the
.lfd.ptd.net remains constant, as does the sonic2 (This is user defined and
can be changed easily. Don't rely on this alone.) Become familiar with the
operators' User@Host information when you use IRC and be ready to recognize it.

One other problem that I have noticed recently is that some people seem to
find it amusing to annoy other #sonic users. Naturally, having somebody piss
you off while you're trying to relax detracts from your enjoyment. So, as
blatantly obvious as this may seem to some of you, I have to tell others to
try to act like a civil individual while they're using chat. (I find it hard
to believe that you act this way when you're talking to somebody face to
face. I guess I shouldn't be surprised.) If I tell you to stop doing
something, you do it. This holds true with all of the other operators as
well. Harassing other users, especially after I tell you to stop, is another
SERIOUS offense, and you will be kick/banned. The ban will remain in effect
for as long as the operators see fit.

Another problem: People have been asking for ops. Let me put this to all of
you plain and simple. I am not interested in having any more channel
operators at this time. All of the operators are people that I implicitly
trust. However, it does not work both ways. Even though I may trust you, it
does not mean I will op you. It is not some personal thing, so don't think I
hate you or anything like that. It is this way for EVERYONE.

If I have to speak with you in private about a disruption that you might be
causing, don't think that I don't trust you and I'll hate you forever or
some other ridiculous thing like that. I will attempt to setlle all problems
in a mature, civil manner the first time around. If you screw up again, then
I'll be pissed off. Believe me, if you piss me off, I will let you know in
the form of a kick, or maybe even a flood that will break your connection
with your IRC server. (You can get back on again, but I don't think you'd
want to deal with me when you get back. I suggest you wait at least a day
for me to cool off.)

If anyone has any concerns about what goes on #sonic, by all means, let me
know. If I'm not there and some catastrophe happens, then E-mail me and tell
me about it. If you are being annoyed by another user, let me know,
especially if I'm there with you. If it happens when I'm not there, then try
to get that person's E-mail address by FINGERing them. (It's under CTCP for
you mIRC users.) If you don't get any information by doing this, make note
of their user@host information and their nick. Then, send me an e-mail
telling me what happened, including their nick and user@host. (An e-mail
address would be most helpful, if you can get it.)

As mad as I am about these problems, I should also say that the majority of
you that come on the channel really make my day. Many of you have been great
on the channel. It makes my job worthwhile, and I've even forged some new
friendships. Keep it up, all of you!

Please notice that I did not name any names in this post. That's because
there have been several people responsible for everything that I've
mentioned. If you're responsible for something that I've mentioned, knock it
off and act semi-normal when you come to #sonic. 

I apologize for making such a LENGTHY post, but this seemed to be the best
way to get everybody's attention. If you have not read the WWW pages, then
GO DO IT. Looks Like I'll be making more updates shortly to include some of
the stuff that I've mentioned in this post.

As always, I am open to feedback. DO NOT DISCUSS THIS ON THE MAILING LIST,
PLEASE. Any concerns should be directed to me privately. My e-mail address
is in my signature.

Sounds like the episode that introduced the Wolf Pack.  BTW-I think that
was a laser that Nicole used to break Sonic's chains.

OK, you asked for it :^)

Spoiler form feed:

The beginning was a bad start for me, since it seemed to be basically a 
rip-off of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  And shouldn't the 
guardian of the Island (these days, Knuckles) be able to bypass all those 
traps and stuff?  And death-traps seem a bit out-of-character for Knuckles'
ancestors - were they so anti-technology they'd _kill_ to prevent it from 
getting out?  And I have a hard time believing Knuckles is enough of an 
athlete to have escaped all those traps (and a harder time about his 
dreadlocks enabling him to fly).

So Archimedes is an evolved fire-ant who dresses like Crocodile Dundee?
Sorry, didn't work for me, but I don't believe in evolution (even if I did, 
to go from ants like we have today to sentience in a few hundred years (how 
old _is_ the Floating Island anyway?) is a bit much to swallow...)

Speaking of swallowing: not to restart the "what meat do sentient furries 
eat?" thread, but I found it ironic that Archimedes was an ant and echidnas 
are spiny ANT-eaters... :^)

And Enerjak being Dimitri after a long nap - I get the feeling of "been 
there done that" but we'll see where you take it...

At least we now know Knuckles' knuckles are part of him (from the letter 
column), but it still requires a bit of suspension of belief that he can 
do what he does without discrete fingers...

Bottom line: I've never been a Knuckles fan either, and only put up with 
him because he was part of Sonic's world.  I'll see the mini-series 
through, but if it becomes a regular series, I'll probably give it a pass - 
the characters aren't cute furries like the Freedom Fighters, and my other
tastes in comic books run more towards superheroes (which ended with Crisis 
on Infinite Earths - don't get me started on that), and Star-Trek, which 
also recently ended.  I also collect Disney, but don't make a great effort 
to find the time to read them.  Anyway, to get back on topic: I'd rather 
see more effort put into the Freedom Fighters (e.g., another Princess Sally 
or Tails mini-series).

Sorry to be so negative, but I guess I see the whole Knuckles thing as one 
more exercise in pushing the video game stuff, which is understandable, but 
I just can't get into it...

BTW, the art was good though :^)

Spoiler form feed:

I hate to be such a naysayer, but here goes:
 
The cover didn't work for me in two areas: Sally seemed a bit paunchy, 
and I couldn't tell if Sonic was supposed to be flying (how?) or hanging 
onto something (how, again, with both arms full?).
 
Story by Angelo Decesare, art by Brian Thomas.
 
The art was OK, though Rotor on page 10 was out of perspective -
he looked more like Butch Kowalski from Littlest Pet Shop :^)
 
The story was OK, though I was expecting a continuation of last issue's 
King Acorn saga...  The usual nitpicks follow:
 
I don't think I buy the bit about Uncle Chuck staying a robot - if he 
(and presumably Muttski) are the only ones left, how will he still spy
on Robotnik?  (Assuming the deroboticization was permanent...)
 
How convenient/lucky Sally gets clobbered like that and only ends up with 
a sprained arm and bruised head - anybody else would've had a broken spine 
or worse, but hey, this is a comic book :^)
 
Robotnik lamenting his "beautiful city" after being wrecked by the quake?
Seems to me he gloried in pollution and destruction - wouldn't a quake 
just hasten the process?
 
The ending seemed a bit abrupt - not even a "to be continued", but the 
letter column indicates it will be...
 
Now for the Bunnie story:
 
Again, I hate to be negative, but I'll sum it up with one word: Dallas.
If that didn't work, here's another one: take the title literally.
 
About all I can say is "now that we got _that_ over with, can we get onto 
some _other_ Bunnie stories?  Or is that all you can do with her?"
 
The artwork by Rich Koslowski was great, but I'll let other drooling 
fanboys comment about the clear indication that she's all robot from the 
waist down, even her tail :^(  FWIW, I just checked the title credits on 
the show, as well as "Sonic Conversion", and they both show she's organic 
from the waist up.  Also FWIW, I notice the title sequence and first 
episode gave Sally solid-blue eyes, yet the second season gave her blue eyes
and black pupils (with a white dot); I prefer the latter, but I digress...
 
After I just now checked Bunnie's de- and re-roboticization in Sonic 
Conversion, I'm afraid this story didn't have quite the same emotional 
impact, but that's probably being unfair, comparing animated sound cartoon 
with a voiceless, unmoving comic book.  Still, that shot of Bunnie on page 3
and her tearful departure on page 7 weren't anything to sneeze at.  However,
I'm still disappointed at the ending - I think I would have preferred some 
technobabble solution over the one that was offered.  Oh well, I suppose 
any Bunnie story is better than none at all :^)
 
I didn't recognize any names in the "find your name in print page" - does
anybody from the list write to the comic itself?  And whatever happened 
to that "notes from the net" idea?

Ron:

You do a pretty good job of teasing.  Too bad I still have to wait a
week and a half before I find out what the heck you're talking about.

I've long had respect for the "Sonic Conversion" ep -- I've said
repeatedly that this was the ep that put the show over the top for me.
Any story that invites conparison has already got my interest.

I think I understand the Dallas reference and I am filled with dread.

Will see.

Hi guys.  It's your freindly netterhood Racewing again, needing a little help.

A few months ago, I asked if anyone out there had made a "dedicated" Sonic
MUD.  There wasn't one, so I and my buddies decided to make one ourselves,
called "Realms of Mobius."  As of late, we've got all the plans drawn out, and
we're ready to code, except for one thing... we don't have any place to put
the darn thing!  We tried to find some places, but to no avail.  I tried to
keep from asking this over the mailing list (I don't want his to be a reerun
of the "Twisted Mettle" fiasco, but since Team Racewing is at the end of their
rope...

Do you guys know of anyplace that lets their users log in to a UNIX based
shell so we can get a port and run this thing? (****PREFERABLY*** free, we're
just poor litle schoolkids! :) )  Thanx.  (Pardon the spelling, i have 5 mins.
to get to class.)

Well, not to steal your thunder or anything, but several fanfic
writers and myself have been slowly constructing a Mobius on
a MUCK named Sociopolitical Ramifications.  It is located at  
svansmoj.ctrl-c.liu.se 23, and it's gradually becoming rather
expansive.

We're still looking for builder-types, familiar with the art
of writing good descriptions for rooms, and some knowledge of
MUCK building technique is preferred.  If you go there, a
wizard will probably be around to make you a character.
After that, you can simply take a 64-bit bus to Mobius.

Regards,

Joe.

I've wondered if Nicole can morph AND take that person's special abilities.
For example, she morphed into Sonic and saved the FF in times of danger.  Oh
well.  Just a little more confusion to the arguement.

Hmmm.  Lemme re-read that again.  Yea, you have a point there, Aaron.  The
Freedom Fighters are enough trouble as it is with Rotubbynik.

I was looking through my Sonic eps last weekend (the Sonic content of my blood
is dangerously low at present) and came across "Spyhog".  Now, something I saw
in this ep has been bugging me for a while now.  Sonic goes to Uncle Chuck's
hideout and gives him a chili dog.  Chuck eats the dog... and says it's
delicious.  Now, I'm not and expert on robotics, but how could his systems
handle a fod meant for organics?  And how could he TASTE it with a metal
tongue?  Just something to think about.  Hope you guys didn't discuss this yet
(I haven't read ALL the list archives...)

>The beginning was a bad start for me, since it seemed to be basically a 
rip-off of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  And shouldn't the

getting out?  <

Sorry you didn't like the Indiana Jones riff, but we were determined to get
the series off with a bang. However, don't chalk up the death-traps entirely
to the echidnas who disavowed technology. There are more than a few secrets
to the Grand Conservatory waiting to be revealed. A hint of things to come is
revealed in issue #3.

>And I have a hard time believing Knuckles is enough of an 
athlete to have escaped all those traps (and a harder time about his 
dreadlocks enabling him to fly).<

Whether or not YOU chose to believe KNUCKLES has the ability to survive all
those traps is one thing. It wasn't just athletic ability alone, he had to
outwit the gauntlet as well. As for his powers of flight, SEGA says he can
GLIDE through the air. It works for me.

>So Archimedes is an evolved fire-ant who dresses like Crocodile Dundee?
Sorry, didn't work for me, but I don't believe in evolution (even if I did, 
to go from ants like we have today to sentience in a few hundred years (how 
old _is_ the Floating Island anyway?) is a bit much to swallow...)<

Who said we showed only a few hundred years of history? And who says those
fire-ants WEREN'T on the same intelligence level as Archimedes? We could
barely squeeze in the plot points and characterizations that we did.

>Speaking of swallowing: not to restart the "what meat do sentient furries 
eat?" thread, but I found it ironic that Archimedes was an ant and echidnas 
are spiny ANT-eaters... :^)<

This was DELIBERATE on our part, and we address this with great relish (pun
intended) in the second issue.

>And Enerjak being Dimitri after a long nap - I get the feeling of "been

Maybe you have, but what about the kids who are part of the audience as well?
My nine year old son and his friends are eating this stuff up.

>Bottom line: I've never been a Knuckles fan either, and only put up with 
him because he was part of Sonic's world.  I'll see the mini-series 
through, but if it becomes a regular series, I'll probably give it a pass - 
the characters aren't cute furries like the Freedom Fighters, and my other
tastes in comic books run more towards superheroes (which ended with Crisis 
on Infinite Earths - don't get me started on that), and Star-Trek, which 
also recently ended.  I also collect Disney, but don't make a great effort 
to find the time to read them.  Anyway, to get back on topic: I'd rather 
see more effort put into the Freedom Fighters (e.g., another Princess Sally 
or Tails mini-series).<

This is a legitimate POV. However, if this does become a regular series,
you'll be missing out on some interaction with SONIC and the FF if you do.
(You have heard of crossovers, haven't you?) Also, initial reaction to the
KNUCKLES mini-series seems to be STRONGER than PRINCESS SALLY or TAILS. If
sales supports this, it's a good chance there'll be more of everyone's
favorite echidna. And Archie isn't playing favorites either. They would love
to see a TAILS or PS series do as well as SONIC. It's you the fans who
determine what is produced and what isn't.

_3_?  So as to end it on a cliff-hanger whether or not a regular series 
results?  Oh well, if ABC could do it... :^)

I guess if I could accept it for Gargoyles, I should accept it for him too, 
eh?  :^)  (But at least they have wings...)

Fair enough - just shows how hard it is to write a "universal" comic that 
appeals to the next generation _and_ the "seen it all" 36-year-old geezers 
like me...

Yup; which series would address Knuckles' and Sally's past?  :^)

Well, to be fair, it's been stated on the list (by Paul C, I think) that 
the marketing/distribution for PS was basically botched (I don't remember
anything said about Tails though).  But I suppose even if it hadn't been,
given that the main audience is pre-adolescent boys, I suppose PS would 
always come out behind Knuckles.  Oh well, c'est la vie...

AH here is the part that gets tecnical.  The possibliity is that Robotization 
replaces certain senses with Robotic counterparts (eyes with optic sensors,
ears with audio recptors, ect.)  Look at Commander Data from the Star Trek:
TNG series.  He uses sensors in his mouth to taste, and food is converted
into another power source(Don't ask How I know this, I don't remember the
book I was reading, possible a source book for RPG).  I hope this helps
somewhat. =:-)

Here's another thing. Any of you trekkers on the list (I know that at least
SOME of you must be! ;) would probably remember that Data could not "taste"
things until the movie, Generations. In an episode of the series, the little
boy that he befriended (Timothy) asked him, "How does it taste? Is it good?"
And Data replied, "I cannot 'taste' things in the manner you suggest." He
needed the emotion chip in order to interpret the taste and decide whether
it was pleasurable or not. 

Now, getting back to the 'bot question, does this mean that the worker bots
actually possess some range of emotions? Assuming you keep the Star Trek
parallel, emotions would be necessary to interpret the taste of something as
good, bad, bitter, sweet, whatever. Making another reference to Trek, Data
verbally analyzed the dessert that he was drinking. However, since he had
never 'tasted' anything before, he was unable to translate that analysis
into some kind of emotional response. He left it simply as, "The complex
polysaccharides...combined with the carbon dioxide..." With Uncle Chuck, he
might have analyzed the chili dog in the same way (Analyzed its sugar, fat,
and protien content) and translated that into tasting good. The only reason
that he would be able to do this is because he had felt the emotion in the
past, and would know what constitutes something that tastes 'good' or 'bad.'   

One other possibility being that Uncle Chuck was just putting Sonic on, and
only said what he did because it was something that would be expected, and
he was being polite. (Haven't seen the ep in question, so I can't really
comment further.)

This probably ties back to the entire free will discussion all over again.
Free will is tied to emotions, as well, I suppose.

All right, Ken, you asked for everyone's honest opinion of the Knuckles
mini-series, so here's mine: I personally REALLY liked it.  I think that it
was definitely worth the wait, and I can't wait to see #2!  However, I did
have to wonder how Archimedes knew about Enerjak when he had been trapped
under Mount Fate for all that time...  ;-)

Not having seen Knuckles #1 (and I won't get the chance for another
week), I can't very well judge the Egyptian motif.  However, there do
seem to be distinct "cultures" on Mobius, reinforced by the existence of
variant dialects of the language.  Again, the handicap is that nobody
seems to have plotted out a comprehensive social geography of Mobius,
let alone a physical one.

'Twas ever thus.  Going back to the greatest furry book ever written,
Richard Adams' "Watership Down," you have several distinct cultures even
within the same species: the warrens of Hazel and Fiver, of Strawberry,
and of General Woundwort, are each different in their own way.  My own
gut reaction as an author: the various writers/artists who have has
their hands in creating Mobius have cast around for Earth models and
thrown them together.  The burden of the fan is to see these random
models as part of a cohesive whole when said whole never got around to
being created.  Hey, nobody said this was going to be easy!

The implications here are just as history and property have been handed down
through generations of echidnas, so too with the fire-ants have their history
been handed down through the generations. However, the fire-ants have a
different perspective from the echidnas.

Also, who says all your questions will be answered in THIS mini-series?

That's why Archie Comics offers subscriptions and back issues, so you don't

I respond to any letter I think needs responding. If you wish to write, feel
free to do so. However, you may not always get a response for various
reasons, most of them dealing with having time for my work and personal life.
OK?

Mike and I have envisioned a world-view concept concerning Mobius. The
problem being is that we haven't had the chance to really touch on this
except in a superficial way. We've hinted at a larger geography via maps and
certain sequences. Remember STH #31? The Dynamac-3000 was being shipped to
the western part of the continent Sonic lives on for crowd control in that
sector.

The bottom line is: there are various groups of Freedom Fighters, but this
series concerns itself with the GREATEST FREEDOM FIGHTERS OF THEM ALL.

Oh no...I assume that this means what I think it does (Knuckles DOES eat
bugs, right?).  Well, I'll add this to my list of reasons to buy Knuckles #2;
I wouldn't miss that for the world...;-)

A 'bot eating?  Very unusual-and very foolish.  I never eat, since I don't
have to in order to survive, and it would wreak havoc on my internal systems.
 A robot's body isn't designed to handle food (at least mine isn't), but
maybe it's different for roboticized creatures.

P.S. For those of you who wonder why I [Mecha-Sonic]  am posting to this
list, it's because I am now an official Freedom Fighter.  Read the upcoming
fanfic "Hearts of Steel" for the whole story (I will get it up...I promise).

     In the most recient copy of STH (#37 for record purposes.  I just
picked up two days ago) Sonic does a selfless act.  (don't worry, This is
not the plot of the story.  It is at the end of it.)  Is there any othe time
that he does one or is this the first.  


P.S. someone should put this issue cover on a poster (Sonic, Sally and Uncle
Chuck with Two SWATS.)
