A story ten years in the future?

ARE PEOPLE READING MY MIND!?!?  WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP WRITING THE STORIES I 
COME UP WITH!!!

sorry about that...it just that I happen to already be working on 
something at least vaguely similar in which Sonic and Sally somhow get 
sent into the future and they see a Mobius ruled by my wonderfully evil 
character, Packbell.  The rebellion's still out ther but things are much 
worse than they ever were in the present day.

Oh well...I'll just write it anyway cause it's my own little Sonic 
universe and I can do whatever I want with it.

So, actually, in a way, I support the idea, but I'll be working solo on 
my own version of Mobius ten year into the future.

Happy Writing! :)

Sorry about sending this to the list.  I tried to e-mail "The Seminar"'s 
author directly, but the address given at the beginning of the story 
doesn't seem to work.  So, I'm mailing it here, hoping that the author 
will see it.  Besides, you other fanfic authors might find a couple story 
ideas I pose interesting.

One conceptual question:

If Master/Packbell has to resort to terror police, does that mean that
the general roboticization of the populace has been undone?  Was a way
found to override it (c.f. Uncle Chuck's experience) so that Mobians
once again have (relatively) free will?  Besides, ten years in the
future (according to a subthread in my story Bloodlines) most
roboticized Mobians would be dead or dying from RTS (robo-toxin syndrome),
which would necessitate a certain amount of social breakdown.

Sounds interesting to me.

Note the first: unless Bookwood Draftshire appears as one of the PCs, I'm 
not treating any fanfics as 'canon'.

Note the second: if he *is* one of the PCs, Packbell suffered a rather 
messy 'disassembly' at the hands of the Master, who was bright enough to 
recognize competition when he saw it.  (:3

Yup.  In some ways, the Master is a lot nicer than Robotnik, and one of
his most benevolent acts was to de-roboticize all his loyal subjects. 
(This includes Uncle Chuck, yes.) On the other hand, this makes the Rebel
Fighters' job more difficult, since many people toe the Imperial line and
don't want any trouble from the bosses... 

The Master has also introduced a new robotization technique, which does 
not suffer RTS or any similar complications, which he uses on those who 
suffer crippling injuries or on condemned criminals.  PCs will be able to 
have replaced limbs a la Bunnie Rabbot, but full-body jobs are almost 
invariably loyal to the Master.

Oh, by the way, speaking of Bunnie: she's one of the *bad* guys...

Just use my philosophy: There are infinite different possible realities, so
therefore, if people write different stories about Sonic, they're focusing
on different realities.  I, myself, have been thinking about several
different future schemes for Sonic and co.  My problem is that he kinda
stole my title...I was going to call one of my future stories "Freedom
Fighters: The Next Generation"!

(1) Is the person who was offering to send folks copies of the S:tH 
episodes still out there?  I need research material.  (:3

(2) Would someone be willing to digitize a few more sound clips for the 
archives?  I'd particularly like "Shut your mouth, hedgehog!" (Sally, 
from the very first episode), "I think I will swoon/hurl", and one of 
Robotnik's manaical laughs.  (:3

(a) I've gotten three responses re: my RPG idea and am putting the final 
touches on the background material which the players will need to know.  
Anyone else want in on this?  I think it'll be pretty cool...

I can probably get all of those.  I know I have the 'swoon/hurl' thing on 
tape, but it would help if someone could give me the episode name.

I'll do it if you can give me the episode titile, and if I have the ep.  I 
have all the 2nd season Saturday morning shows, all of the pre-recorded 
Saturday morning show video tapes, and none of the weekday shows.

Dear friends

     I just heard from somewhere else that as a result of its merger with ABC,
Disney now partly owns DIC.  So maybe we can egg Disney on to make some sort
of settlement with Sega to revive "Sonic".

The "Shut your mouth, hedgehog!" quote was from the episoze with Lezar, 
the once-evil wizard, who drained Sonic's speed; I think it was titled 
"Super Sonic", and it was on one of the packaged first-season tapes.  The 
"I think I will swoon!/I think I will hurl." quote came from "Spyhog", I 
think...

Well, I don't know what I would use it _for_, but since I have all of
those episodes on tape, perhaps I could help out with this.

One of the better episodes of Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog already 
has a pretty good parody of a scene from Star Wars.  I'd say, at least
give your friend the chance to prove to us how much of an idiot he is. :-)

One advantage we also have is that the pre-recorded StH video tapes were 
released by Buena Vista Home Video which is owned by Disney.  Many of 
Disney's movies are on that label.  They also use Touchstone, a 
semi-autonomous company they also own.

Howdy All.
 
        I don't know if this had been posted allready or not, but I picked
up a copy of Sonic #27 & Triple Trouble #1, and found it rather ironic
that ABC would be advertising their 'New Saturday Morning schedule"
 
        It goes like this:
 
        8:00    Madeline
        8:30    Free Willy
        9:00    --not yet decided-  (anyone got any info?)
        9:30    Bump In The Night
       10:00    Fudge
       10:30    Reboot
       11:00    Bugs Bunny Tweety Show
       12:00    What A Mess
       12:30    ABC Weekend Special
 
	The ad is done up in a sort of labyrinth type game, with the last 
        words of the instructions saying, "Watch out for those FOXes"  heh!

        Well, unless something spectacular goes in that 9:00 time slot,
        I allready know what channel I'll be watching Sat AM's...and it 
        won't be ABC.
 
        I wonder if a letter to the Sonic-Grams, asking in an innocent
        fashion, where Sonic went would be of any use?  I don't see Free
        Willy with a comic book / mailing list / usenet group!
 
        Ahh well, enough ranting.

I wonder if this is where they're planning on putting that 'Dumb and Dumber'
cartoon they were threatening.  There's two guys in that Sonic 27 ad 
which look like they could be the Dumb and Dumber guys?.

Hey!  You got Triple Trouble #1?  I haven't been able to find that one by us!

Yeah right... A little Anti FOX network propaganda here?

ON a different subject:  I remember someone asking where these pictures
came from:
 sonair.gif
 sonbin.gif
 soncycle.gif
 sonrace.gif
 sonsea.gif 
 sonspc.gif

I just heard about Sega's FTP site  (ftp.segaoa.com) and found these in the
directory  /sega/Pictures/Sonic.  There's other stuff too.. including Hints 
and Cheats for games.

Hmmmmm.  It was previously reported in r.a.a that 1) one of ABC's Fall
cartoon shows would be based on the film "Dumb and Dumber"; and 2) that
the ABC kidvid execs who made that decision had gotten the sack.  So
perhaps D&Der was supposed to take the 9:00 slot.

Don't think that even asking nicely will get Sonic on by Fall; even if
Sega and DiC have patched up their differences, you need about 6-8
months to produce a half-hour cartoon.  That might get Sonic on in time
for the Feb sweeps, but it's still doubtful.

Still, I don't suppose it could hurt to make our feelings known to Dic
and ABC/Disney or whatever they're going to be calling themselves.

Well, the annual country youth fair is about a week away here in Berrien
County, Michigan (hang in there, I'll get on-topic in a minute).  And in
addition to the usual booths and rides and such, I expect to see one
booth doing business: some people from Lafayette, Indiana, bring their
wares to the fair each year.  The shop must cater to Deadheads, because
they always bring a lot of Grateful Dead and Dead-related t-shirts with
them.

So once again I can count on seeing a shirt for sale featuring a green
forest creature, whose bod is covered, not with quills, but with
cannabis leaves.  Yes, it's almost time for the annual appearance of...

[This is where we get on-topic]

CHRONIC THE HEMPHOG!!

I think I'd rather wear a Free Willy shirt.

I guess I need to tell you all that I have to put my E-mail 
account on Vactaion mode (any incoming mail will be deleted).
The reason I have to do this is because I cannot access it at 
home, because my modem is fried, and the computer lab at my 
college is shutting down for three weeks.
	Can someone please send me a summery of what was 
discussed, when I get back? Thanx.

Hmm.. Maybe we don't advertise this enough.

You can get the current month's message archive by mailing to
majordomo@lists.mv.net and put this in the message body:

get sonic mail.txt

It will be mailed to you and in the unix mail format. Just all one big file
with all the internet message headers.

and if you want older than the current month's, we have every message 
since the list started at the ftp site. They are all zipped.

Wrong.
Don't you guys know how to use majordomo? Sheesh!!

To unsubscribe, write to majordomo@lists.mv.net and put

unsubscribe sonic

in the message body.

If you write it to sonic@lists.mv.net it goes to everyone and we all get to
see that you WANT to unsubscribe, and you get to stay on the list until you
write to majordomo@list.mv.net. You see the great thing about computers is
they keep us from having to do work, and if someone writes to the list, and
the list maintainers have to unsubscribe a person manually, it defeats the
purpose. But hopefully we won't get that many people unsubscribing from this
list. Ok, I'll sit down now. :-)

I just got a big list of unlisted items, enough to take us from ML v3.0 
to 4.0 except that 3.0 isn't done yet.  I'm going to set v3.0 of the 
Merchandise List aside for a while to turn my attention to the mailing 
list's Web page.  I'm going to try for a fully-redone Web page installed 
by Monday.  (To those of you who might be drawing pics for the page, they 
can be added as part of the next revision.)

Hey, Lindsay!  I forgot you were on this list!  Anyways, as I told you in
the club, I like it.  As for my expectations of "To Be or Not To Be", first
off, Sonic and Sally MUST be hooked back up.  Sally and Antoine make little
or no sense together!  Also, some romance between Amy and Tails would be a
nice touch.  I'll leave the rest of the plot up to you and anyone else on
the list who has any ideas...

The Amy rose story "From Amy Rose, with Love" IS on my WW page in two 
formats. First, is just straight text which you can read online.  The 
other formate is simply a ZIP file of the Windows Write file that 
includes pictures.

And Sonic isn't a product of merchandising??!?!   Isn't Sonic SEGA's very 
own mascot of sorts?  Aren't there over a hundred different products with 
Sonic on them?

Or are you just complaining about the animaniacs fans .. such as those who 
write leud stories about Yakko and Hello-Nurse?

-- On a different note --

I finally found an issue of the Sonic Triple Trouble 48pp special (Archie)
No review... just a few comments:

The return of everyone's favorite fall-apart badnik.. Crabmeat!  

We finally get to see the (possible) covers of the Tails Miniseries.
(I say 'possible' because they changed the Sally Miniseries covers).

Ya know... the more I see Knuckles, the more I like him?  Go Knux!

Despite firing the TV execs who made the decision, I'm suspecting we're 
going to get treated to 'Dumb and Dumber' in that mystery SAT-AM ABC 
time slot.  Anyone on this list hear any rumors as to what's going to 
be here? 

I guess I was wrong... I thought that mysterious guy in the S&K 48 page 
Special [story: Fire Drill] was Nack the Weasel but it looks like its 
someone else.

I just got a new "Disney Adventures" magazine with an ad for ABC which 
puts "Dumb and Dumber" in that time slot.

Try this:

Sonic:   Come join the Blue Blur Hedgehog
Tails:   And the Happy Fun Fox Tails
Sonic:   Compared to my speed Sneezly and Robuttnik are like snails
All:     Robotnik tries to find our home and catch us, but he fails
         But Sonic spins up great, big winds --
         You might even call 'em gales!

Yes, and if it weren't for "Reboot" and "Bump in the Night" I wouldn't watch
the new 'Disney' channel at all.  (Madeline has already been run on the Family
Channel otherwise I'd give it half a look)

As the execs at ABC might have sang at the merger meeting. . .

My friend and I are almost done writing a new story, entitled "Jaded
Views".  It involves a few familiar characters, and a LOT of characters
made up by members of Sonic '95 (the Sonic club I'm in on Prodigy).  I'm
going to have it available in two formats: Text and Windows executable.
Anyone who wants it in *.exe format, let me know; I'll have to transfer it
uu-encoded since Prodigy users can only send text over the 'Net.  I'll
probably send the text version through the list; if not, I'll announce to
the list when I'm posting it on Usenet.  Only thing is, Sonic isn't a real
key character in this story; although he is in it, it mostly revolves
around the "new" characters Kabuki, Maxl, Tracker, and Jade.

Somebody's got to do it!

	What kind of new characters have you prodigy guys come up with 
anyway? Just curious, as I don't have that service.

You can find out when you read the story!  (Yes, I'm copping out.  The
reason is that they're too numerous to name!)

Nah, there's no difference between the *.exe and the *.txt except that the
*.exe is a bit more user-friendly (giving you the option to click on the
chapter of your choice).  I may, eventually, upgrade the *.exe to include
pictures, and maybe even limited animations, but that's not happening
anytime soon.  If it does happen, though, I'll create a *.wri (or maybe an
MS-Word *.doc) that has the pictures.

No prob...I explain Hedgehog X's origin in detail, as well as all I know
about Kabuki, and all users need to know about the other characters (X,
Amaroq, etc.).  Of course, since this is where Maxl, Jade, and Tracker are
introduced, it goes without saying that they're described pretty well.

I thought I was already on the list as I have been receiving the mailing
list for over a month now.  The system I am calling on does mailing
lists in a different way than usual to cut down on the drive space
needed, so it might not be addressed to me directly.  If this is the
case, how can I be added to the list without pissing off the local BBS
gods?

Did I forward that to the list? I meant to send that to Erich.
And I call myself a computer expert.

I've seen 'em here (Michigan) at Meijer and Wal-Mart.  They were
originally listing for $2.50 @, so it looks like they're not moving as
fast as their subject.

I just saw these yesterday at "Woodman's"... a grocery store chain I've only
seen in Wisconsin.  I bought the two bundled books and a third individual
book... titled "Palace of Terror" or something to that effect... no need
to correct me on this name.. I'm pretty sure its wrong and can always get
the right name in 10 minutes.  :)

Didn't someone review these books?  I've been curious as to where I could
get them and viola... They're right there on the rack.  One curious thing
I noticed about them is that unlike the TV series or the Archie comics.. 
Uncle Chuck and Muttski's been 'deroboticized'.  I also noticed that the
first book called Rotor a sea lion while a later book called him a walrus.
[The first book called Sally a Chipmunk too... I guess the writer wasn't
sure what was going on either at this point].

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season (see FAQ #9).

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

This represents an expanded synosis of the second of Teitelbaum's
books.

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.

often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the

Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 ("All The
Mail's About Tails!").  Theories range from transplantation to
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no "official"
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
(in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with "Deadliest of
the Species" in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving"
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
"creative differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
delay.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
of the "Doomsday" episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
     /Spaziante
     Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile
evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.



Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
     "Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich &
          Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.
     Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
far and describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is
renouned for his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally & Geoffrey
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
     Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD),
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).




#22 [May 1995]
     "The Return"
     Penders/Spaziante & Harvey M.
     The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with
Children; cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_). 
Sonic & Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics," (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
deactivates "Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
"You owe me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
Spaziante artwork.
     "Tails Knighttime Story,"
     Decesare/Manak & John Dagostino
     As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows"
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
     Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep
reading."  Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
"creative differences" theory in Q7.


Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species": Part 2
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed).
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
if so what does she look like? "Of course...her origin may yet be
told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in "Bloodlines"
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.




#23   [Jun 1995]
     "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
order to save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
which I'm not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
     "Vol-ANT-teer"
     Decesare/Manak
     Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.


Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
the chamber blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred. 
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
     "When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
     Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
     Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
     "Panic in the Sky!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hrair_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
     "Fire Drill"
     Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Must be Nack the Weasel -- check out the SonicGram in
issue #23 for a hint.
     "Lord of the Floating Island"
     Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
     While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25  [Aug 1995]
     "Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
     Story: Mike Gallagher
     Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
     "Way, Way Past Cool"
     Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
     "Fortified"
     Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.





NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.org ?

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original four-part Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
     Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
     Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher & Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2  [Sep 1993]
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.

#3  [Oct 1993]
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4  [Nov 1993]
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.


#5  [Dec 1993]
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6  [Jan 1994]
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7  [Feb 1994]
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8  [Mar 1994]
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
the hall.


#9  [Apr 1994]
     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate eil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10  [May 1994]
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11  [Jun 1994]
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12  [Jul 1994]
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13  [Aug 1994]
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14  [Sep 1994]
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.


#15  [Oct 1994]
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     


#16  [Nov 1994]
     [Summary by Erich Schulman]
     "Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
     "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. "The Mail's About
Tails" (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
from the roboticizer ("Rabbit Deployment," #3).  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.



#17  [Dec 1994]
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.



#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night" (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
     Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
     An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
     Story and art: Scott Shaw!
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

Part 6

     Sonic knocked weakly on Sally's door.
     "Sonic!  What happened?  You okay?"
     "Tails is fine.  We got him back, and Bookshire's looking him over right 
now."
     Sally breathed a huge sigh of relief.  "Oh, that's good to hear.  Are 
Tolouse and Todd okay?"
     Sonic looked down.  "Tolouse is okay.  He's over at Bookshire's, too."
     A cold chill went down Sally's back.  "W-what about Todd?"
     Sonic looked up at her again, silent for a long time.  Finally he spoke, 
his voice even quieter than before.  "Tails is fine," he said again.  "Todd...  
Todd saved his life."  He fell silent again.
     A tear came to Sally's eye.  "Oh, no..."
     Sonic only nodded.

* * *

     Tolouse climbed slowly up the tree, ready to start his turn of sentry duty.
It was late at night, and the sky was both cloudless and moonless, the stars 
proudly displaying themselves without any competition.  When he reached the 
platform, he found Antoine snoring away.  Tolouse decided to let him sleep while
he looked out at the sky.
     Tolouse tried to think, but he couldn't form his thoughts any more 
coherently than he had his words that day, which was to say with any 
comprehension.  His mind recycled the same scenes over and over from the past 
couple of days: the... "event" itself, coming home, explaining to Sally, 
Bookshire and the others what had happened, the little memorial service they had
had for Todd, his feeble attempt at saying something at the service...  Finally,
his mind pushed out one clear thought, and he sighed, looking at the stars.

     Goodbye, Todd.

* * *

     ..."MOMMY!!"...

     And the pain was finally gone.

The End.

IT'S FINALLY FINISHED!! :)

Hello, and welcome to my third and final Sonic story, completing a trilogy
(more or less) that started with "Tolouse's Story" and continued with
"Run with the Fox".  Sorry it took so long.  This has been a very unmotivating 
summer. :)  A very special thanks to Craig "Todd" Moore, without
whom this story would not have existed in quite the same way.  Other
"thank you"s and "hiya"s go to all the FurTooniacs:  Sonic, Sally, Tails,
Bookshire, Rotor, MetalFox, Monolith, Mason, Nemo, Nikko, and many many more.

Comments and suggestions can be sent to: gt6005a@prism.gatech.edu

Part 1

     ..."MOMMY!!!"...

     And, all these years later, the pain still remained.  The pain, and the 
bitter, driving desire for revenge.

* * *

     "Did you get it?"
     "Of course we got it!  Let's juice!"
     Sonic, Sally, and Bunnie raced over to a nearby alleyway, hiding themselves
in the shadows.
     "Okay," Sally said, "I hope this works!"  She looked at the timer displayed
on Nicole.  "10, 9, 8, 7..."

     Tolouse looked at his chronometer.  Hoping that all was going as planned, 
he began counting down at the time they said the charges would be armed.  "...5,
4, 3, 2, 1!"  He looked up.
     The explosion rocked the city, engulfing the coolant treatment plant in an 
angry display of fire and thunder, reducing it to a pile of twisted metal and 
jagged concrete in mere seconds.
     "YES!" Tolouse shouted, his voice drowned out by the din of the blast.  
"YES!" he shouted again, clapping his paws and howling with victory.

     "ALL RIGHT!" Sally shouted and grabbed Sonic in a victory hug, a lovely 
sight silhouetted by the fire consuming what was left of the plant.
     Bunnie giggled.  "Ah don't mean to interrupt y'all, Sugarhog, but we need 
to be gettin' out of here!"
     Sonic chuckled.  Sally regained her composure (after giving Sonic a quick 
kiss) and spoke into the com-link.  "Tolouse?"

     Tolouse pulled out his com-link.  "Yes, Sally?"  They could hear the 
excitement in each other's voices.
     "We did it.  Meet us over by the building rubble on the northern side of 
the plant."
     "I'm on my way."  He gave a quick look around, and left his hiding place, 
cautiously making his way down the streets toward the rubble, eyes continually 
going back to the demolishment of the plant.  It was while he was looking at the
destruction when he ran into something, or rather somebody, and both he and this
other figure fell to the ground.  Tolouse immediately looked for a hiding place,
but then he noticed what he had run into.  It was a fox!
     "W-who are you?" this other fox said.
     Tolouse was about to ask the same thing.  The two foxes studied each other 
for quite some time when the com-link broke their concentration.
     "Tolouse, are you okay?  Where are you?"
     Tolouse, still keeping his eyes on the other fox, took out the com-link.  
"I'm okay, Sally.  I'm coming."  He holstered the com-link and said, "We can't 
stay here.  Come on."  He motioned for the other fox to follow him.
     As the two made their way to where the others were, Tolouse said, "My name 
is Tolouse.  What's yours?"
     The other fox was silent for a moment before finally saying, "Todd."
     "And what are you doing here in Robotropolis?"
     Todd shrugged and then said, "Well, what are you doing here?"
     Tolouse was thinking about what to say when he heard a new sound.  Looking 
back, they saw a fleet of hovercraft heading towards the remains of the coolant 
treatment plant.  "We better get out of here!"
     Tolouse ran the rest of the way, with Todd following.  They soon reached 
the rubble, where the others were hiding.

     "Here he comes!"  Sonic said.  "And...he's got somebody with him!"
     Sally and Bunnie looked as well.  Tolouse was running towards them, with 
another fox running along behind him.  "I wonder who that is," Sally said.
     Tolouse was soon there, and he spoke.  "Hey.  We need to get out of here.  
There are a bunch of hovercraft coming.  Oh, this is Todd."
     Todd gave a small wave, but kept quiet.  Sally studied this new arrival, 
but not for long.  "Hello Todd."  Addressing everybody, she said, "Okay, let's 
get back to Knothole."  And they began making there way back to the city limits,
where they could safely hide in the junkyards as Sonic transported them home.
     As they left the city, Todd said only one more thing.  "Knothole?"  There 
was a look of hope in his eyes.

To be continued.

Part 4

     "No, no, Antoine!  Like this!"
     Todd demonstrated the kick yet again as Tolouse and Tails looked on.  Then,
again, Antoine tried to mimic it, with disastrous results.
     Tails giggled and Tolouse shook his head and chuckled as Antoine picked 
himself up from having fallen over.  Again.
     "Zat was better, yes?" Antoine asked.
     "Uh...  Maybe we should try something else," Todd suggested.
     "No no really, I am wanting to learn zis.  Here, I try again."
     Tolouse helped Antoine back up from another attempt.  "Yeah, let's do 
something else..."
     It had been two weeks since Todd had first arrived in Knothole, and in that
time, he had made himself at home.  Perhaps it was because they were all foxes, 
or perhaps it was because their histories were similar, each having lost family 
to the forces of Robotropolis, but in that time, Todd, Tails, and Tolouse had 
become good friends.  Now, they were out on a camping trip, deep within the 
forest and quite a distance from Knothole.  Antoine had come with them as well.
     "Why not?" Tolouse had said.  "The poor fox is lonely.  Besides, we could 
use the entertainment."  The others had laughed in agreement.
     Todd was showing off his skills again.  He whirled around, and a nearby 
tree branch was splintered by a kick.
     "Cool!" Tails said in awe, and the others were equally impressed.
     None of them noticed a small device hovering behind them in the darkness.

     "Sir, rebel freedom fighters have been sighted," the Swat-Bot stated. 
     Packbell looked at the screen and chuckled.  "Excellent!  That is the one 
we are looking for."  All but ignoring Todd's show, he focused the spy-bot's 
camera on Tails and smiled.  Tonight, he would set his plan into action.  And to
kidnap him out from underneath the noses of three of his friends, he thought in 
anticipation.  How will they be able to live with themselves, knowing that poor,
poor Tails was taken from right in front of them, and then killed for all of 
them to see?
     It's an easy question.  They won't.
     Not as long as I have anything to do with it.
     "Swat-bots, start with the preparations for our guest.  Then let me know 
when our campers have fallen asleep."
     "Yes, Commander," was the automatic reply.

* * *

    An android hand slipped quickly over his muzzle, and before Tails was even 
fully awake, he felt himself being carried off into the night.  He tried to 
scream, but no sound could emerge from his closed mouth.  He soon felt something
that was all too familiar:  the clamp of a Swat-Bot's metallic hand.
     "Keep him quiet until we have left the area."
     Tails squirmed helplessly in the Swat-Bot's grip as Packbell's hovercraft 
left the area, the engines as quiet as Packbell could make them.

     Back at the campsite, the remaining three foxes slept on.

* * *

     "Tolouse, Antoine, wake up!  He's gone!"  Todd was near panic.
     Tolouse struggled to clear the haze of sleep from his head.  "Who?"
     "Tails!  He's gone!  I can't find him!"
     Sleep was winning the battle.  "He probably just went into the woods."
     "No, he hasn't.  He's gone!  Look at this!"  Todd handed Tolouse a pad that
he had found where Tails had been sleeping.  Tolouse slowly managed to focus his
eyes...and they flew open wide when he did.

     Attention Freedom Fighters:

     If you want to see your friend alive again, you will come to the old
     Museum of Arts building by the end of the day.

     Sincerely: Commander Packbell

     Tolouse quickly got up.  "Okay, let's get back to Knothole and tell the 
others."
     Todd shook his head.  "No way.  I'm going after him!"
     "Do what?"
     "I know where that building is, I remember seeing it when I was in the 
city.  I'm going now!"
     "Todd, wait!  Sonic will be able to get us there much faster, and he and 
Sally need to know about this!"
     "Fine, you tell them, but I know if I start now, I can make it there in 
plenty of time."   He took off into the woods, at a sprint that Tolouse knew he 
wouldn't have been able to keep up with.
     "Todd!" he shouted, but the fox kept running, and was soon out of sight in 
the dense forest.  Tolouse sighed, but he knew what he had to do.  If they were 
lucky, they could make it back to Knothole before the sun was too high.  
"Antoine, wake up!"

Spoiler alert, assuming form feeds do much good for most people:

Unfortunately, Part 6 (the last one) came through first, and I couldn't 
help reading it, thus know that it has a sad ending, thus am not that 
motivated to read the rest of it when it does come through.  Maybe if I get 
in a better mood...

One question though: I didn't get the last two lines - does that mean the 
whole trilogy was a dream?  If not, somebody please explain it to me - I'm 
too beat to think of it signifying anything else except a cry of catharsis, 
and I find it hard to believe that _that_ would be enough to take away the 
pain...

Part 3

     At the time that Sonic and the others were returning to Knothole, sounds of
destruction could be heard within the Robotropolis Command Center.
     "SNIVELY!" Robotnik's voice boomed across the room.  "TELL ME!"  He grabbed
his nephew by the collar and picked him up to look at him face to face.  "YOU 
TELL ME!  HOW COULD THEY HAVE DONE IT?!  HOW??!!"
     Because of you! Snively wanted to shout at him.  You should have foreseen 
this and increased security at the plant the very day that freedom fighter was 
captured!  Don't whine to me about something that is completely your fault, 
*sir*!
     But out loud, Snively only said, "I am looking into it, sir."
     Robotnik held him there for a moment longer before finally releasing 
him...by tossing him into a nearby wall.  He turned to say something more, but 
then turned back around and sat in his command chair, tapping his fingers, 
leaving Snively to glare at his back.
     From the entranceway, Packbell stood, watching all this.  Packbell always 
enjoyed tormenting Snively, and he would have been enjoying the abuse Robotnik 
was dealing Snively now, were it not for the circumstances.  Packbell had come 
to the same conclusion that Snively had:  The loss of the coolant treatment 
plant was the result of Robotnik's short-sightedness.  The fool had made yet 
another mistake, he thought.  Only this time, we're all paying for it.  He 
turned and walked away, making his way to his private quarters.

     It is time for a new plan of action.

* * *

     Late that night, Packbell sat at his workstation.  File after file appeared
on the screen as Packbell called them up, as if at random.  He wasn't really 
reading them, though.  His mind was elsewhere.
     How to stop the Freedom Fighters?  Too many times they have gotten away, he
thought, and though Robotnik's poor strategy has a lot to do with it, there's 
something about them that seems to give them the upper hand.  What?
     Packbell thought hard, working on theories.  It couldn't just be the desire
to overthrow Robotnik.  Packbell had easily dealt with such ambitious people in 
the past.  He didn't think it was just their talents, either.  Sure, things like
Sonic's speed, Sally's cunning, and Bunnie's strength were all important 
factors, but again, it wasn't anything that Packbell felt he couldn't handle.  
Then what was it?
     Packbell's eyes focused on the screen, and he found himself looking at a 
file detailing one of Robotnik's excursions from a few months ago.  Robotnik had
succeeded in kidnapping Sally and Tails, but instead of dealing with them in a 
timely manner, he had simply held them in the hopes of trapping Sonic as well.  
Sonic had appeared, but only to succeed in rescuing them, not to be captured.  
Yet another example of Robotnik's superb planning, Packbell thought 
sarcastically.  The same could be said about what had happened recently.  
Robotnik's desire to "play" with the Freedom Fighter they had captured had only 
resulted in his being rescued by Sonic.  If only Robotnik wouldn't insist on 
putting off what needed to be done *when* it needed to be done...
     Suddenly, it hit him.  That's it!  That's what kept the Freedom Fighters 
going strong.  Comradery.  They were always there for each other.  Whenever one 
of them was in danger, the others always tried to help in any way possible, and 
usually (again thanks to Robotnik, he thought darkly) there was such a way.  
Now, how would they react if they couldn't pull off such a rescue?  Not just 
anybody of course, as Robotnik's forces had captured and roboticized Knothole 
citizens before, but one of the main group.  Yes, he thought, what would happen 
to their precious egos if they watched one of their own die, slowly, painfully, 
knowing there was absolutely nothing they could do to help?  An evil smile came 
to his face.  An excellent idea, he told himself.  Now, who should it be?  
Sonic?  No; although the lack of Sonic's speed would certainly hurt them, they 
would probably use his death as a reason to band together and fight that much 
harder.  Sally?  No, for the same reason.  His mind went over each name, 
dismissing them for one reason or another until finally he thought of:  Tails.  
Yes, Tails, the young fox who was always looking up to the Freedom Fighters.  To
see their young friend vanquished before their very eyes...  Packbell began to 
chuckle.  It was almost too perfect.  With Tails' death weighing on their minds,
he was certain their morale would be destroyed.  And soon after, so would they.
     Packbell typed in a set of commands, and the information that the computer 
had on Tails appeared on the screen, including a picture.
     "You are my key," Packbell said to image on the screen, "to disposing of 
the Freedom Fighters once and for all!"

To be continued.

Part 2

     The group was soon back home in Knothole, and they all went to Sally's hut 
to congratulate each other, and to become acquainted with Knothole's newcomer.
     Todd's spirits had lifted when he entered Knothole, and he was looking 
excitedly around, taking it all in.  He still wasn't saying much, though, and 
Sally decided to prompt him.
     "So, tell us about yourself, Todd," she said.
     Todd looked at her and shrugged, saying, "I've just always wanted to find 
this place and meet you all.  I've heard a lot about you."
     Sally smiled.  "Well thank you, Todd, but that doesn't tell us much about 
you.  Where are you from?  How did you know about us?"
     "Yeah," Sonic chimed in, "and what were you doing all alone back in 
Robo-ville?  That's not a way to easy living, you know!"
     Todd sighed and looked away from them.  "It's a long story."
     "Hey!  We got time," Sonic said, and the others nodded in agreement.
     Todd turned around, his face looking weary, having lost some of the 
enthusiasm.  "Okay."  He looked for a place to sit, and did so.  "Should I start
at the beginning?"
     "That's usually the best place."
     Todd nodded.

     "I used to live in a small village close to the edge of the Great Forest, 
north of what I guess used to be Mobotropolis.  It was just me and my mother, 
because my father had disappeared when I was real young.  I don't really 
remember too much about it, I just know that I was happy and my Mom loved me.  
And then...that day...it was my sixth birthday, no less..."

     Todd's mind went back to that fateful day nearly a decade ago: the day of 
the coup.  After taking over the city, Robotnik's forces, with Packbell in 
command, quickly spread all over the northern continent, enslaving the 
populations of every city and village they could find.  It was Packbell himself 
who had seen to the areas surrounding Mobotropolis, including the Great Forest, 
and Todd's village...

     Cammy held her young son close to her.  She, her son, and the rest of the 
villagers (those who had survived the raid) were in a hovercraft, being taken to
somewhere in the newly rechristened Robotropolis.  There was no sound, save the 
whine of the hovercraft's motors and the occasional sob from somewhere within.  
The raid had been very quick, and in under ten minutes all the villagers had 
either been forced into the hovercraft, or were dead.  Now, they were being 
taken away, and none of them had any idea where.  Cammy cradled her son, trying 
to shield him from the fear that was tearing her apart.
     Todd, having no idea what was going on, buried himself in his mother's 
chest fur, not wanting to look out.  What was supposed to be a day of 
celebration for him had turned upside down, and now, all he felt was fear.  He 
cried, and Cammy held him tighter.
     Eventually, the hovercraft stopped, and the villagers were hoarded out of 
it and soon found themselves in a wide open room, housing nothing but a raised 
podium.  There they were made to wait, as if dared to imagine what their unknown
fates were.  And then, Dr. Ivo Robotnik and his android commander entered the 
room.  Robotnik stepped up to the podium and Packbell stood by his side, laser 
rifle in hand.
     "Citizens of Mobius," Robotnik began, "I am sure you are all quite confused
and curious about what is going on here."  He chuckled.  "It is all very simple 
really.  I, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, formerly known to you all as Julian, Minister of 
War, have decided that his majesty King Acorn is unworthy to rule, and therefore
I have...persuaded him to step down and allow me to take his place.  Now, what 
does this mean to you all?"  He paused, looking around at the frightened faces, 
grinning with evil pleasure.  "I am pleased to tell you that your lives will 
become much easier to live.  No longer will you be burdened with the uncertainty
of deciding what to do with yourselves.  Gone will be the regrets of having 
taken the wrong steps in life.   Thanks to modern technology, something that 
King Acorn never had an appropriate appreciaton for, you will be sent through a 
process called 'roboticization', where you will become living robots, existing 
only to serve my purposes."  Robotnik could still see fear in the faces in the 
room, but he also noticed disbelief and anger in a few as well.  That will 
change, he thought.  "Perhaps some of you have not heard about the work of Sir 
Charles Hedgehog and do not believe that such a thing is possible.  In that 
case, let us go ahead and demonstrate this remarkable technology to you all.  
Packbell."
     The android nodded in reply, and motioned to the Swat-Bots at the edge of 
the room.  Soon, the crowd was escorted out of the room and deeper into the 
building, finally coming to a room not quite as big as the one before, dominated
by machinery surrounding a huge glass cylinder.  Robotnik rubbed his hands 
together in gleeful anticipation.  "Now, citizens, who wants to be the first 
volunteer?"  His eyes slowly scanned the room, finally resting on a trembling 
female squirrel near the far edge of the crowd.  "You.  Swat-Bots, bring her 
here."
     The young squirrel shrieked in terror, but Robotnik seemed deaf to it as 
the Swat-Bots literally dragged her from the crowd up to the glass cylinder.  
Robotnik pressed a button, and the cylinder slowly raised, allowing the 
Swat-Bots to place her on the pad the cylinder had surrounded.  Before she could
react, the cylinder slid down again, imprisoning her inside, her screams no 
longer heard outside the encasement.  Robotnik pressed another button, and a 
steady whine gradually increased in volume.  The roboticizer was charging.  
"Now," he said slowly, deeply, "watch carefully."
     The crowd was taken completely by surprise as the squirrel was suddenly 
engulfed in a searing yellow light, and they gasped in horror as she transformed
right before their eyes.  Fur and skin became metal.  Eyes glowed red.  Her 
arms, which had been pounding against the cylinder in panic, ceased their 
movement and hung loosely at her sides.  Finally, it was over, and the cylinder 
slid up again, revealing a robot where a living squirrel had once been.  
Somebody screamed.  Somebody else fainted.  Cammy clutched Todd even tighter, a 
tear wetting her cheek fur.  
     Robotnik only smiled.  "The process is a quick one, as you see, and it is 
not specific to gender, age, or species.  Remarkable, is it not?  Now, who will 
be next?"  Once again he made a point of looking around slowly, until finally he
chose a male fox, not much older than a kit, being held in his mother's arms.  
"You."
     "NO!!" Cammy screamed, holding Todd away from the Swat-Bots' reach.  "I 
won't let you!  He's just a child!"
     Robotnik slowly walked over to her and glared, emphasizing every syllable 
as he stated, "There is nothing to gain from resistance, for you will be 
roboticized as well.  Now.  Give - him - to - me!"
     Cammy shouted her denial again and then, in her panic and anger, the 
vulpine instincts of her ancestors took over, and she clamped her muzzle down on
Robotnik's arm.  Todd fell out of her arms and quickly ran behind her, only to 
be roughly picked up and held by the Swat-Bots.
     Robotnik howled in pain and surprise, but Packbell was swift, rushing over 
and forcefully removing her from his arm.  Robotnik doubled over, his other arm 
clutching the wound in an attempt to stop the bleeding.  But then, he looked 
back up, and slowly began walking over to where Packbell was holding her.  He 
stopped in front of her, doing nothing but glaring at her for one long minute.  
Then, he seized her out of Packbell's grasp, one hand getting a firm grip on her
neck.  He turned and looked at Todd.  "Say goodbye, young fox."  Anger burned in
his eyes as he tightened his grip until...
     *SNAP*
     "MOMMY!!"  Todd cried out.  He struggled against the Swat-Bots and somehow 
found himself freed from their clutches.  Todd wanted to run to his mother, but 
in one quick second he looked at her, he looked up at Robotnik, and something 
inside him took over.  He found himself bolting for the doorway, running as fast
as he could.
     Almost instantly Packbell had the laser rifle aimed, but before he could 
fire, Robotnik pushed it down.  "Let him go," he said.  "He will learn his 
lesson soon enough.  He'll never make it out of the city alive."  He dropped 
Cammy's lifeless body to the floor, and glared at the remainder of the crowd.  
"Packbell, see to it that the rest of these prisoners are processed smoothly, 
using any means necessary.  Swat-Bots," he pointed to Cammy, "see to that."  He 
turned and walked out of the room, holding his wounded arm.
     Robotnik had been wrong.  Todd, by nothing short of a miracle, had managed 
to find his way out of Robotropolis.  It was a small victory, however.  He was 
now completely on his own, and he had not the slightest idea where he could go 
or even what he needed to do to stay alive...

     Todd paused.  It was difficult to continue.  "I don't remember what 
happened right after that too well.  I was in the Great Unknown somewhere, 
half-dead when I was found by a group of travellers also escaping Robotnik.  I 
was with them for several years after that, as we wandered all over, trying to 
stay away from the patrols.  One of them, a wolf named Sebastian, was a master 
of many martial arts, and the others had looked to him as their leader.  He 
liked me and trained me to fight.  We lived as best we could, hiding where we 
could, and constantly moving so Robotnik wouldn't be able to trap us.  And then 
one day, a few months ago, we met up with another group of travellers.  They had
a storyteller with them, and that night we all sat around a fire listening to 
him.  One of his stories was about a village somewhere in the Great Forest, 
where a hedgehog who could move faster than sound led a group of animals in 
fights against Robotnik."  Todd smiled.  "You guys."
     "Whoa!" Sonic said.  "Ya hear that, Sal?  They're already writing stories 
about us!"
     Sally merely rolled her eyes, chuckling.
     Todd continued.  "Soon after that I decided to leave, and I found my way 
back to the Great Forest.  I wanted to find you guys, to meet those who were 
actually putting up a fight against Robotnik, and maybe..."  His voice trailed 
off, but that look of hope was again in his eyes.
     Sally was pretty sure what he was about to say, but there was still one 
unanswered question.  "So, Todd, what were you doing in Robotropolis?"
     Todd looked down.  "I had wandered all over the Great Forest looking for 
this place, but I never found it.  And then, this morning, I found myself near 
the edge of the forest, looking at the city.  I thought about what Robotnik did 
to my mother..."  He hesitated.  "I just wanted to find something, anything I 
could do to hurt him."
     Sally shook her head.  "You wouldn't be able to do anything, alone like 
that.  You're very lucky you weren't captured and roboticized."
     Todd shrugged.
     Sonic tried to cheer him up.  "Well, you're here now, bud!  Come on, we're 
gonna have us a party tonight!"  He turned to the others and threw his fist in 
the air.  "We did it!"

     That night, the Freedom Fighters and most of the villagers sat around a 
campfire.  Sonic was telling the story of their mission with his usual bravado, 
receiving gasps of astonishment from many, as well as the occasional snicker 
from those who had been with him.  Todd was there as well, and he had been 
introduced to many of Knothole's residents, and his spirits were high.  He had 
finally found Knothole.  Did he finally have a place to call home?  More 
importantly, he thought:

     Will I finally be able to pay Robotnik back?

To be continued.

Part 5

     Tolouse didn't even bother knocking.  Sally nearly dropped Nicole in 
surprise as he burst into her hut.
     "Tolouse, what in the---?"
     "Tails is gone!  Packbell took him!  Look at this!"  He handed the pad to 
Sally.
     She read it.  "Oh no.  Where's Todd and Antoine?"
     "Antoine's back at his hut.  Todd...  He went after them."
     "He did?"
     "There was nothing I could do!  He said he knew where the building was and 
then he took off before I could stop him."
     Sally rubbed her forehead.  "This is *not* good.  Okay, go get Sonic.  We 
must act quickly."
     Sonic was soon there, and the three worked out a plan.  Sonic gave his 
usual suggestion.  "I say we go bust him out now!"
     "Sonic, you don't have any power rings, remember?  You used them in your 
little show yesterday, and the next one's not for another three hours!"
     "I can run fast enough without 'em, and we need every second we got!  No 
telling what Packbell will do if he sees Todd alone!"
     Sally had to admit Sonic was right.  "Okay then, we should get going."
     Sonic shook his head.  "You're staying here, Sal."
     "I beg your pardon?"
     "Look, this isn't some carefully planned mission.  It's gonna be dangerous 
and I don't want you getting hurt.  Let me handle 'im like only I know how."
     Sally thought and again admitted to herself that Sonic had a point.  They 
shouldn't risk both of their lives on this one.  "Okay, but you're not going 
alone.  I suggest that you take Bunnie with you."
     "Bunnie's sick, remember?  She got a cold."
     Sally rubbed her forehead again.  This was looking worse with each passing 
minute.  "Alright.  Tolouse, will you go?"
     Tolouse had little desire to face Packbell again, but he would not hesitate
to help Tails or Todd.  "Of course."
     "Good.  Okay, get going!"
     "C'mon, Tolly!  Let's juice!"
     Sally watched from her doorway as the blue streak melted into the woods.  I
don't know why, she thought, but I have a bad feeling about this.

* * *

     Todd tore through the woods, his years spent on the run allowing him to 
keep up a brisk pace.  As he ran, his mind was also in high gear.  There were 
many memories: his home, his mother, the years spent with Sebastian and the 
others, and finally, his time at Knothole.  It seemed that at the end of each 
happy memory, there was a traumatic one waiting to be relived, and in every one,
Robotnik or Packbell played a central part.  There had been many times like 
this, when the memories played themselves out, and each time, Todd's hatred of 
Robotnik and Packbell had grown, and not a day had gone by that he didn't dream 
of making them pay for what they had done -- by any means, at any cost.  Had 
Sally and the others known just how immense this hatred had become, they would 
certainly have worried about him.  It is sometimes impossible to tell just how 
far one will go when all other goals, all other thoughts have been tuned out, 
save one.
     This time was different, though, for he had not one goal, but two.  Tails 
was his friend.  He considered the young two-tailed fox to be one of the closest
friends he'd ever had.  Packbell's going to pay for ever even thinking of 
kidnapping him! he thought.  Todd would stop at nothing (NOTHING!) to make sure 
that no harm came to Tails, and that Packbell would suffer for what he'd done.
     Packbell, I swear to you, on my mother's grave, you WILL NOT GET AWAY THIS 
TIME!
     He pushed himself harder, running as fast as he could.  Finally, he found 
himself outside what used to be the Mobotropolis Museum of Arts.  He was the 
first to arrive.

     Tails shivered in silent fear, wavering in and out of consciousness, as 
Packbell busied himself at a portable terminal, making sure that his other 
duties were taken care of and that he would not be missed while his plan was 
being carried out.  They were in the main display hall, where the works of 
Mobius's legendary artists had once resided.  The museum had been neglected 
during the time of the Great War, and one of King Acorn's hopes had been to have
the museum restored back to its full glory when the war ended.  Robotnik, of 
course, had had other ideas when he staged his coup, and now the building was 
just one among many others, decaying and forgotten in the outskirts of the city,
far away from the main activity of Robotnik's factories.  Which, of course, made
it an excellent place for Packbell to carry out his plan without any worry of 
Robotnik interfering.
     Packbell checked the status of his projects, as well as the of the 
rebuilding of the coolant treatment plant.  Good, everything is on schedule, he 
thought.  By this time next week the plant will be operational again, and I can 
finally turn my attention to---
     "Packbell!"  A voice broke the silence.
     Packbell turned around and saw a lone fox standing in the distance 
entryway.  He casually stood up and picked up his laser rifle as he said, "And 
who are you?"
     "You should remember me, Packbell, after what you and Robotnik did to me.  
And my mother!"
     Packbell, of course, had every face that he had ever enountered memorized, 
but even for an android it is easier to recall some faces more than others, and 
he didn't feel the need to waste time scanning his memory for this particular 
one.  "Spare me the bad monologues and tell me why you are here, and I might let
you live that much longer."
     "I have come for my friend Tails and to make sure that you are never able 
to pull anything like this again."
     Only one fox, and not one of the main Freedom Fighters at that?  This was 
not the rescue party Packbell had figured on.  Perhaps the others were on their 
way, and for whatever reason this one decided to strive ahead.  Personal 
vendetta, maybe.  Packbell chuckled to himself.  There's one in every crowd, and
they all got what they deserved eventually.  Now, however, was not the time.  
Holding the rifle with both hands, he said, "I'm afraid that you are a little 
more than helpless to retrieve your friend here.  As you can see, he is quite 
restrained and any motion towards him or me will be quite painful, I can assure 
you.  Now, run along and make sure your friends are here by sundown, or there 
will be no hope of rescuing him."
     This quick dismissal was certainly not what Todd had expected, and his 
anger began to boil, consuming him.  "NO!!  I will NOT be ignored so easily, do 
you hear me?!"
     Packbell, now irritated, turned back around.  "Did you not understand me?  
Get out of my sight!"
     "You will face me, NOW!  You owe me that much for all the misery you have 
caused me!"
     Something about this one, Packbell thought.  He's different.  So, he 
scanned his mind, and eventually came across the memory of a young kit during 
the time of the initial coup.  He gave Todd a chilling grin.  "Ah, now I 
remember you, and I must admit I am impressed that you are still alive.  You 
know, I have to tell you it was a lovely sight seeing Dr. Robotnik deal with 
your mother the way he did.  Seldom does he get that involved in dealing with 
prisoners, and it is always a pleasure watching him when he does."
     Todd trembled.  "Shut up!  I swear you will pay for that!"
     Packbell sneered.  "I told you to spare me the speeches.  I can easily 
guess what you're here for."  Packbell then thought for a moment.  "But can you 
imagine what I am here for?  Have you stopped to think about why I kidnapped 
your young friend here when I could just as easily have taken any or all of you 
last night?"
     Todd refused to listen.  "All I know is you are not going to get away with 
it!"
     Packbell chuckled.  "Oh, I think I will.  Let me tell you my plan..."

     Meanwhile, two more figures had slipped quietly into the display hall, from
an entranceway on the opposite side of the room.
     "There they are," Tolouse whispered.  "And look, there's Tails!"  He 
pointed to where the unconscious fox sat tied to his chair.
     Sonic looked.  "Packbell's got his back to us, and it sounds like he's 
bending Todd's ear.  C'mon!"
     "Where're we going?"
     "We're gonna get Tails out of there super fast.  Then we'll get Todd and 
blow this hole."
     The two crept stealthily over to Tails and began working on his restraints.
Much too close for comfort, Packbell continued detailing his plan to Todd.

     "...You see, far more times than I would care to remember, your precious 
Freedom Fighters have succeeded in their plans, resulting in their continued 
existence as well as the destruction of much of Robotnik's property.  I began 
looking for ways end their luck, and I believe I have found one.  What do you 
think would happen to the Freedom Fighters if they witnessed both the kidnapping
and..." he paused, chuckling, "...the killing of one of their closest and 
youngest friends, right in front of them, while they were utterly helpless to do
anything about it?"
     Todd shuddered.  "You would really... just to see how they would react?  
They would do everything they could to destroy you!"
     Packbell chuckled.  "I think not.  Why, to have their free-spirited friend 
here *crushed* before their very eyes?  How would they sleep at night?  How 
would they be able to look at themselves in the mirror?"  He took a step towards
Todd.  "And, how would they fight?"
     "You-- I won't let you do this!"
     Packbell chuckled and said with a hideous whisper, "Watch me!"

     Tolouse was sweating bullets.  "Sonic, are you done yet?"
     "One more to go, bud.  Here, help me with this...yeah, that's it.  Now 
pull."
     Tolouse pulled, and the final restraint gave way, but not silently.
     CLICK!!
     Oh, gods...

     Packbell turned, his eyes instantly focusing on the source of the sound, 
and then on Sonic.  "You!"
     Sonic was quickly on his feet.  "Yeah, me.  Who'd you expect, the cleaning 
lady?"
     Packbell was in even less of a mood for Sonic's attitude than normal.  He 
raised the laser rifle.  "I guess I will just have to execute my plan that much 
quicker.  Say goodbye, hedgehog!"
     Sonic prepared to dodge, but he noticed the rifle was not being aimed at 
him.  "Huh?  Now wait a Sonic sec---"
     Tolouse's heart pounded as it looked like the rifle was pointed at him.  
"Oh my---"
     Packbell focused his aim, ready to pull the trigger.
     All thoughts and actions were broken by a scream.  Todd howled as he raced 
across the display hall.

     What happened next took place in much less time than any of those present 
remembered it.

     Tolouse darted sideways, bumping into Sonic.

     Sonic grabbed him and quickly pulled him down behind him, then reached up 
for Tails.

     Packbell hesitated slightly... ever so slightly... before pulling the 
trigger.

     Todd jumped in front of Tails, still howling.

     Packbell pulled the trigger.

     A blinding flash.  Thoughts of panic, wondering if these were the last 
moments.

     The howling stopped.

     When he realized that he was still alive, Tolouse looked up.  "TODD!!"

     Sonic didn't waste anytime at all.  With adrenaline adding to his strength,
he scooped up Tolouse in one arm and Tails in the other, and raced out of the 
display hall before Packbell had another chance to fire.

* * *

     It was several minutes later before any of the participants were thinking 
clearly.  By that time, Sonic was passing the city limits with his two 
occupants.  Tails was easy to carry, as he was still unconscious.  Tolouse was 
another matter.
     "We can't just leave him back there, Sonic!  We can't!"
     "There is nothing we can do," Sonic replied, all hints of his famous 
attitude gone for the moment.  "I'm sorry."
     They moved on, toward their destination of Knothole.

     It was several minutes later before any of the participants, carbon-based 
or otherwise, were thinking clearly.  By that time, Todd was breathing his last 
breaths, and Packbell stood over him, exploding with anger.  Packbell was going 
over the events in his mind, and with each replay, his anger and frustration 
deepened.  He couldn't deny the truth to himself.  He had hesitated.  Todd's 
scream had distracted him, and although he recovered in a slim fraction of a 
second, it had been enough.  It had been enough for Todd to block his shot.  It 
had been enough to allow Tails and the others to escape.
Now here he was, watching the foil of his plan die at his feet, and still not 
getting any satisfaction from it!
     He roughly picked up Todd and was ready to shout at him, to threaten him.  
But what could he say?  'I'll kill you for what you did'?  He was already dying!
All he could think to say was, "Don't think I'll stop here.  Take to your grave 
the knowledge that I will win!  Do you hear me!  I *will* win!"
     But Todd didn't respond to that.  Instead, he mustered all of his remaining
strength to raise his head, look Packbell eye-to-eye, and whisper one last 
sentence, which he did with a smile.
     "I beat you."
     Then his head fell, and Packbell knew there was nothing more he could do or
say to scare or hurt Todd.

To be continued.

(I assume you uploaded them in the proper order :^))

>And you shouldn't've read it!! :)

I wanted to get a feel for the story, and didn't know it was the last part. 
Helpful hint: show the parts as Part X of Y or X/Y.

>Those last two lines will make sence when you read the first two lines...
>as well as the whole story. :)

Indeed; here's another spoiler alert:

I'll interpret it as a cry of reunion; nice touch!
Reminded me of the ones Christians will have with each other and with Jesus
some day in heaven - sort of like the little girl in that Disney World 
commercial:  "I've been waiting to meet you my whole life!"

Nicely written story, but still depressing; I guess I've been watching too
much network TV where death hardly ever shows up.

majordomo does begin distributing posts in the order that they arrive at 
the list server.  Sending each part in the correct numerical order does 
not guarantee each part will arrive in the correct numerical order.  You 
can increase your chances by waiting 3 minutes between sending each 
part.  A delay of several hours between sending parts is almost a guarantee, 
albeit inconvenient.  BTW, the same rule applies for uploading large 
files to alt.binaries.* newsgroups.

Well, school's starting, which means I'm only going to be here on weekends
for the rest of the school-year...good news is, I've skipped 7th grade.

I found some ppats on info-mac and converted them into JPEGs so anyone can
use them. They were origionally ppats which means they were Mac wallpaper. So
they are great for Mac or Windows wallpaper! 

Some I already had, but 8 of them were little screen grabs from the Sat.  AM
show, which I didn't have, and I just added them. As you can see, they are
quite small, but as always, "way past cool". :-)

While scanning the dial this weekend, bumped into a commercial on the
USA Network which stated that Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (the
syndie show) is moving to USA.  Presumably it will become part of their
Cartoon Express package.  Don't know whether that means it will
disappear from your local UHF outlet or not.  The move will probably
happen some time in September; consult your local listings.

Subject: Skipping grades (off-topic), was Re: weekends
Sender: owner-sonic@sard.mv.net

Note: the following is off-topic, but I wanted to let everybody else have 
the opportunity to get involved in any further discussions...

>From: AHVT94B@prodigy.com (MR THADDEUS R BOYD)

>Well, school's starting, which means I'm only going to be here on weekends
>for the rest of the school-year...good news is, I've skipped 7th grade.

Hmm, maybe I should forward you the logs I made from rec.org.mensa when I 
posted about this several months back - from what I remember of the 
follow-ups and e-mail replies, this wasn't universally a negative 
experience, but in general it was.  I posted about it to see if anybody 
else's experience was like mine: I skipped 5th grade, and have suffered 
socially for it ever since.  While it's possible that this still would have 
been the case had I not skipped the grade and thus been that much smarter 
than my colleagues, the fact that after skipping the grade I was still smarter
than most of them, _plus_ being a year behind them physically, pretty much 
destroyed any dating and other social opportunities I might have had...

I don't mean for this to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for you though, so 
my advice is to take advantage of as many social opportunities as you can 
to get to know your new classmates and establish some good friendships if 
possible.  If you're into sports, go out for them, but hopefully the year's 
difference won't be too much to overcome (I'm not athletic, which was 
another strike against me).

I'm curious as to whether or not any of this came up as an issue during 
the supposed discussions you had with your counselor, parents, etc.

Anyway, if anybody wants to discuss this further, I suggest we take it to 
e-mail and not clutter up the list any more...

Unfortunately, my local listings only say "Cartoon Express" and indicate 
the duration (5 hours, or whatever).  They used to break it down by the 
individual shows, but they've not done that in a long time.  It's not 
very often I can take out enough time to watch the whole block to derive 
the schedule, so please post Sonic's time slot if you find out.

Well I found it.
 Heres what I have so far:

Prologue (continued from "From Amy Rose, with Love)

 "I'm sorry I slapped you Sonic." Sally started, "I'm going out with 
Antoine now. He's a prince.
Anyway I think we should see other animals."
  "I guess so." Sonic said. A tear formed in his eye.
  "Comeon my princez." Antoine said, he smiled.
Sally smiled. She took Antoines hand.
  "Antoine....yes."Sally said, her words full of meaning.
Sonic glared at Antoine.
 Antoine smiled and slid the ring on Sally's hand.
They held hands as they walked off into the sunlight.


To Be Or Not To Be
Chapter One

THE NEXT DAY.....
Antoine slid out of bed slowly.  Antoine opened his eyes,and saw 
Sonic. Sonic had an angry look on his face.  Antoine fell out of bed. 

   "ECKKK!" Antoine screamed.  
  "Yo, Shut-up Ant. You want to wake everybody?!" Sonic said. A red 
hand-print wear Princess
Sally slapped Sonic was still visable. Sonic wore  green boxers. He 
looked like he was angry, but the way he told Antoine to shut-up, it 
was clear that he was not mad at Antoine, he was mad at Sally.
  "Whatz to youz want?" Antoine said, wide awake now.
  "It's Tails! He's gone! I woulda' gone to someone else, but they 
went on a mission. The only ones left are supposed to be Bunnie, Amy-
Rose, and Tails.
  "Thank-you so much for you're ze encoragement" Antoine said. He 
then quickly got dressed and they went outside. "I thought you 
mightze want to knowz that me and my mon-sherie,Sally iz ouw you zay, 
engaded. Pleasez excuse my french."
  "Is that a joke Antoine?" Sonic asked.
  "No joke,me an ze Sally iz en-" Antoine started, but Sonic 
interupted.
  "Not that 'twain! The part about "Excusing your french"
  "I am ze french, am I not?" Antoine said, now becoming confused.
  "Never mind Ant."
They walked towards Tails hut. When they got there, Sonic pointed out 
that there was no sign of struggle, and no sign that Tails had ran 
away. The only possible thing Tails could have done was followed the 
others on the mission. A top secret mission that is.
  "Sonic, I zay we not worries about Tails. He's probally fine, no?"
  "No."
  "Sonic,trust me." 

And thats what i have, I plan on having Sally Break up with Antoine, 
and tails is captured by robotnik.
Any Sugestions?

thanks,
Bunnie Rabbot

A while back, I requested information from the (I believe) president 
of the "Sonic the Hedgehog Club" on Prodigy on how one can join the club 
if one has just a regular internet account, not a Prodigy account.  I 
was told by this person that the requested information would be posted to 
alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog, but I haven't seen it there.  To this person: 
If you (I can't remember your name) read this, please send me the info 
asap, ok?
Sorry to everyone else, but I couldn't remember her name.

And if you get same, could you please post it to the Sonic mailing list
as well?  Our local sysop refuses to grant access to ANY alt.fan.*

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic

Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone

mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season (see FAQ #9).

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

Game Gear Adaptation #1 [Oct 1995]
Triple Trouble issue
     "Tttriple Tttrouble!!!"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
Robotnik miscalculates when trying to exploit a Chaos Emerald as
a power source, and the stone splits into two fragments.  One
half lands in the Great Forest where a new set of action zones is
created.  The other half lands on Knuckles' floating island where
it starts burrowing into a mountain.  Knuckles investigates but
is hit on the head by a rock and loses consciousness.  As for
Sonic, he enters the new zones to retrieve the shard, but as soon
as he does so he's knocked out by Knack the Weasel.  As for
Knuckles, he comes to in a cave surrounded by a group of Ancient
Walkers--cave-dwellers wearing masks.  After some exposition
about how if the half emerald should come in contact with the
Floating Island's emerald it'll blow the place apart, Knuckles is
returned to the surface in time to trash Knack, who happens to
have Sonic in the trunk of his vehicle.  Sonic & Knuckles start
to resume their old grudge match when Robotnik contacts Knack in
order to keep the plot moving.  Sonic & Knuckles reunite the
Emerald which disappears; they then part company after exchanging
insincerities and mutual distrust.  As for the emerald, it
reappears in the possession of the Ancient Walkers.
     "Submersible Rehearsal"
     Story: Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
Tails' joy as Rotor finishes work on The Sea Fox is punctured
when he learns that Sally has instructed Rotor not to put any oil
in the sub (fuel or lubricating? It doesn't say).  Tails then
learns that Robotnik has an octobot terrorizing sea creatures;
this information comes from an oil-soaked gull.  Draining the oil
from the gull to power the Sea Fox, Tails defeats the octobot and
destroys the underwater robot factory.  This is all prelude to
the Tails miniseries--a full-page ad shows Spaziante cover
designs, but we all remember what happened to the cover designs
for the Princess Sally miniseries, don't we?

Back on the floating island, Knuckles interrupts a tussle with
Vector to investigate what he thinks is a Robotnik invasion
attempt.  But it turns out he's being taunted (as in "Fire Drill"
in Sonic & Knuckles #1) by someone whose name turns out to be
Archimedes.  He leads Knuckles to the Chaos Chamber where he
tells Knuckles that "only when you can find me will we know that
you are capable of seeing the answer within the question."  The
solution promised in the upcoming Knuckles Chaotix issue.

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 ("All The
Mail's About Tails!").  Theories range from transplantation to
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no "official"
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
(in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with "Deadliest of
the Species" in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving"
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
"creative differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
delay.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
of the "Doomsday" episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original four-part Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
     Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
     Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher & Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2  [Sep 1993]
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.

#3  [Oct 1993]
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4  [Nov 1993]
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.


#5  [Dec 1993]
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6  [Jan 1994]
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7  [Feb 1994]
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8  [Mar 1994]
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
the hall.


#9  [Apr 1994]
     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate eil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10  [May 1994]
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11  [Jun 1994]
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12  [Jul 1994]
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13  [Aug 1994]
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14  [Sep 1994]
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.


#15  [Oct 1994]
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     


#16  [Nov 1994]
     [Summary by Erich Schulman]
     "Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
     "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. "The Mail's About
Tails" (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
from the roboticizer ("Rabbit Deployment," #3).  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.



#17  [Dec 1994]
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.



#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night" (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
     Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
     An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
     Story and art: Scott Shaw!
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
     /Spaziante
     Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile
evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.



Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
     "Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich &
          Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.
     Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
far and describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is
renouned for his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally & Geoffrey
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
     Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD),
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).




#22 [May 1995]
     "The Return"
     Penders/Spaziante & Harvey M.
     The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with
Children; cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_). 
Sonic & Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics," (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
deactivates "Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
"You owe me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
Spaziante artwork.
     "Tails Knighttime Story,"
     Decesare/Manak & John Dagostino
     As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows"
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
     Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep
reading."  Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
"creative differences" theory in Q7.


Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species": Part 2
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed).
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
if so what does she look like? "Of course...her origin may yet be
told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in "Bloodlines"
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.




#23   [Jun 1995]
     "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
order to save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
which I'm not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
     "Vol-ANT-teer"
     Decesare/Manak
     Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.


Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
the chamber blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred. 
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
     "When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
     Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
     Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
     "Panic in the Sky!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hrair_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
     "Fire Drill"
     Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.
     "Lord of the Floating Island"
     Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
     While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25  [Aug 1995]
     "Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
     Story: Mike Gallagher
     Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zone portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
     "Way, Way Past Cool"
     Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
     "Fortified"
     Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.

#27 [Oct 1995]
"A Scrambled Hedgehog"
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
     While retrieving a message in Robotropolis, Sonic collides
with a SWATbot with sufficient force to knock himself out. 
Coming to in Robotnik's headquarters, Sonic displays all the
symptom [singular] of that favorite condition of writers
everywhere: amnesia.  Robotnik passes himself off as Sonic mentor
and advisor.  After working out on some Freedom Fighter dummies
left over from the Princess Sally miniseries, and after having
had a microtransmitter planted on his person, Sonic is sent to
Knothole to "observe the underground terrorist group."  Sonic
enters a secret tunnel entrance to Knothole, but Rotor's security
system detects the bug.  Rotor tries everything he can to stop
Sonic before he can get out of the tunnel, but Sonic spins his
way out to the surface and enters Knothole, apparently under the
impression that his orders are to combat rather than observe.  To
be continued.
     At least the artwork didn't go schizo, switching from
Mawhinney to Manak halfway through.  Anyone else get the
reference to the Patrick McGoohan cult TV classic, "The
Prisoner," on page 3?
     Sonic Art: I know he's only 6, but Mitchell Resk's drawing
of Sonic makes him look like he's wearing a diaper.
     Triple Trouble Coming Attractions
     Gallagher/Manak
     Essentially a two-page ad for the upcoming issue.  Weirdest
panel is the one inviting readers to CHECK OUT PRINCESS SALLY IN
A HOT PINK STRING BIKINI, just before Sally nixes the idea.  And
this is the same Sally who went through the first season on TV
wearing nothing in the world but a pair of boots!  Apparently,
Gallagher is also Not Clear On The Concept when it comes to
clothing and furries.  Oh well, there are always the WEB site
pictures....
     Sonic Grams: PUH-LEEEZE lose the office humor; it's taking
up valuable space that could be used by "Noted From The Net"
[whatever happened to that idea?].  Recaps the contents of the
Triple Trouble issue, plus indicates that #28 will include the
preamble to the Tails miniseries.  Someone asks about Sonic's
sneakers; Robotnik gets a fan letter; and someone asks the names
of Sonic & Sally's offspring from #22.


Game Gear Adaptation #1 [Oct 1995]
Triple Trouble issue
     "Tttriple Tttrouble!!!"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
Robotnik miscalculates when trying to exploit a Chaos Emerald as
a power source, and the stone splits into two fragments.  One
half lands in the Great Forest where a new set of action zones is
created.  The other half lands on Knuckles' floating island where
it starts burrowing into a mountain.  Knuckles investigates but
is hit on the head by a rock and loses consciousness.  As for
Sonic, he enters the new zones to retrieve the shard, but as soon
as he does so he's knocked out by Knack the Weasel.  As for
Knuckles, he comes to in a cave surrounded by a group of Ancient
Walkers--cave-dwellers wearing masks.  After some exposition
about how if the half emerald should come in contact with the
Floating Island's emerald it'll blow the place apart, Knuckles is
returned to the surface in time to trash Knack, who happens to
have Sonic in the trunk of his vehicle.  Sonic & Knuckles start
to resume their old grudge match when Robotnik contacts Knack in
order to keep the plot moving.  Sonic & Knuckles reunite the
Emerald which disappears; they then part company after exchanging
insincerities and mutual distrust.  As for the emerald, it
reappears in the possession of the Ancient Walkers.
     "Submersible Rehearsal"
     Story: Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
Tails' joy as Rotor finishes work on The Sea Fox is punctured
when he learns that Sally has instructed Rotor not to put any oil
in the sub (fuel or lubricating? It doesn't say).  Tails then
learns that Robotnik has an octobot terrorizing sea creatures;
this information comes from an oil-soaked gull.  Draining the oil
from the gull to power the Sea Fox, Tails defeats the octobot and
destroys the underwater robot factory.  This is all prelude to
the Tails miniseries--a full-page ad shows Spaziante cover
designs, but we all remember what happened to the cover designs
for the Princess Sally miniseries, don't we?
     "First Contact"
     Story & Art: Ken Penders
Back on the floating island, Knuckles interrupts a tussle with
Vector to investigate what he thinks is a Robotnik invasion
attempt.  But it turns out he's being taunted (as in "Fire Drill"
in Sonic & Knuckles #1) by someone whose name turns out to be
Archimedes.  He leads Knuckles to the Chaos Chamber where he
tells Knuckles that "only when you can find me will we know that
you are capable of seeing the answer within the question."  The
solution promised in the upcoming Knuckles Chaotix issue.


NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.org ?

I just scanned it from the latest sonic comic (issue #27)

ftp://rat.org/pub/sonic/images/comic/bikini.jpg

which means ftp to rat.org and it's in
/pub/sonic/images/comic with the filename "bikini.jpg"

I'm glad I got it.
This is the first sonic comic i have. Is this typical? If so I think i'll be
getting more. :-)

First off i have an Idea for thoes who have a BBS for Sonic fans. Once i
find the files needed I will start work on a project called Legend of
the Blue Hedgehog. This will be an Ad-On for the Hit door game Legend of
the Red Dragon. It will (I Hope) Replace the Look,Enmies,and Teachers
into sonic charectors. It's a Big project i will star on and hope to
have out near the end of the year. Here is the help i need. 1:For
charector replacements should I have the charectors that the players
play as be like Sonic and Sally or should they be other freedum
Fighters. If they are others then I can have Sally replace Violet and
Sonic replace the bard. (They are the charectors in the Inn that players
can get info from and even flert with). 2. I need some Into Ansis that
can replace the start up screens. I think you can do that. I need some
good sonic art with or without the title on it.  3. I need some names
and ideas for Enemies and Other charectors in the game. There are 12
fighting masters in the traing arena. I plan on haveing Bunnie as the
head warrior and some other charectors as other teachers. And i need
some genral enmies to replace all the forest ones form the game. There
are 20 enmies for all 12 levels. If you writers out there have
charectors for one or the other let me know. I hope to get premission to
use Bookshire as a master (Maby Level 11) and Packbell as one of the
enmies in the forest. Aswell as any other charectors I can get.

Thank you and write to  John_Mankowski@outdoor.com

I found and read the HTML version of 'From Amy Rose, with Love'.

Fun story :)  I could comment more but the only comments I'll make are that
I'm glad to see Antoine can be portrayed as something other than a complete
bafoon.  The illustrations were a nice touch to the HTML verions.  Also.. 
It seemed like everyone was a bit 'underwelmed' at discovering that Antoine
is a prince.  I would've expected Antoine to be confused.. then estatic
about the whole thing (possibly bragging about it).

Hmmm... Promising beginning however I've never been able to come up with
a decent plot to a Sonic story so I can't really think of any good ideas
for this story.  (except that Sonic would probably convince Antoine that
Tails was probably tagging along behind and alone or else Sally and the
others would have brought him back immediately).  Sonic and Antoine could 
also have a bit of an argument as to weather Antoine is 'really' a prince
or not (I'd expect Sonic would be the most sceptical).

Same here.  I've already sent some comments to L.C. by e-mail (if you
didn't get them, Lindsay, e-mail me directly).  I won't divulge any
details on a suggested story line but would like to go public with a
couple comments.

Probably the weakest aspect of the story.  It was introduced without any
set-up or follow-through.  When I had Sally realize the significance of
the brooch in Chapter 2 of "Bloodlines" I tried to convey, through her
actions and dialogue, how shocked she was by the turn of events.
Something this important to the life of the character should have a bit
more set-up.  Also, as I mentioned in my post, I'd have thought Nicole
would have access to archival information to establish Antoine's
pedigree.

Just my $.02 for the benefit of the list.

I hope its not going to be _the_ Duck "Bill" Platypus in the Tails
miniseries. :)

The cover preview for Sonic#29 looks interesting!  Sally gets
Roboticized, with Dulcey looking on..  Are there plans for a
`Grand Unification' of the several Sonic storylines in the
cartoons, comics, and games? :)

Since the beginning of 1995 I'm trying to get videotapes of the SatAM  
Sonic The Hedgehog cartoon, but everyone who promised to send them to me  
let me down.

Is there anyone who has both the first and second season on tape and would  
be willing to send them to me?  I live in Germany, but I will pay  
_everything_ necessary to get them.

If you can help, please send e-mail to

        sanasi@deco.franken.de

to discuss the details.

I would prefer them in S-VHS and PAL, but I will take recordings in normal  
VHS and NTSC as well.  If you don't have all episodes recorded but are  
willing to help, please write to me too.

Desperately waiting for replies

I just got Sonic #28 today, but its all screwed up!
The first page is that shadow scene and I don't even get to see part 
1 and 2 of the first story.
Also I don't get to see the Sonic Gram page, or the ending of Tails 
story, let alone waht his story is called!
  I want to write to archie comics and conplain,
  but I don't have their address because I didn't get the Sonic gram 
page!


Oh well, looks like i'll just have to buy a copy from the store.
any one else have this prombelm with this issue or any other issue?

Some of you know that I'm now on FurToonia (and that my character has 
only a minimal connection to Mobius).

I tried out FurryMUCK today for the first time, and I also have an idea 
for an entirely Sonic-based character to develop there.  Is Mobius in any 
way represented on FurryMUCK (like the Great Forest on FurToonia)?

(This thread should be moved to private e-mail or page #mail if it gets 
too MU*-specific.  It can stay here if the focus can remain on Sonic and 
the other citizens of Mobius.)

I'm having a major trouble with Furtoonia. I've used two different apps to
open a telnet connection and I _can_ get a brief connect for less than a
second (no text/data transfer either) and then the connection gets
drop-kicked. According to a routetracer, one of red_panda.tbyte.com's
routers, specifically the one that's "pointed" in my direction, is a little
screwy or is rejecting connects from my domain. I've no idea why if it's
the latter. Who can help me with this little conundrum?

Alexandra,

My sysop tells me that my message to you may not have gotten through so
I have to go public with this.  I don't know why Archie won't honor
Mexican subscriptions, especially since they mail to Canada.

Anyway, here's how it'll work: I can subscribe to Sonic on my own (right
now, I'm still buying off the newsstand) and then mail you each issue.
If you want me to subscribe for you, send me your mailing address and
US$20.00 ($15 for the subscription, $5 for postage/handling).  You can
reach me at my work address:

   Daniel J. Drazen
   James White Library
   Andrews University
   Berrien Springs, Michigan  49104-1450

Of course, send cheque or money order, as the US Postal Service takes a
dim view of sending cash through the mail.

Funny, I thought NAFTA was supposed to make this EASIER!

Hi there fellow Sonic fans.

The English Sonic comic (published by Fleetway) has reached issue #59.   
Therefore I thought it would be nice to send you a checklist of all the  
stories that have been published in this comic so far...

Most of the stories are split up over several issues.  If a story has  
subtitles, then they are listed before the issue numbers.

For those who already got photocopies of some of the Sonic stories from  
me, here is a list of the more important events in the Fleetway storyline:

- Issue #8 - #10
  Sonic's origin (along with the beginning of a totally new storyline)

- Issue #24 - #28
  Sonic's fight against the Metal Sonic (adaption of the CD game).

- Issue #33 - #36
  Sonic meets Knuckles (adaption of the Sonic III game).

- Issue #45, #47 - #53
  Sonic & Knuckles fight Robotnik on the Floating Island, destroy the
  repaired Death Egg and retrieve the Master Emerald from Robotnik
  (adaption of the Sonic & Knuckles game).

- Issue #53 - #58
  Knuckles meets the Chaotix team (adaption of the Knuckles Chaotix game)

- Issue #59 - ?
  The sequel to 'Knuckles Chaotix'.

BTW, if you have any questions about the English Sonic comic from  
Fleetway, about the stories in general or if you just want to send some  
fan-mail, you can now use the following e-mail address:

        stc@richb.demon.co.uk

Some of the letters may even be printed on their Speedlines page (much  
like the Sonic-Grams page in the Archie comic).

Now, here is the list:
