    Sorry Guys, but loyalty aside, there's little to no doubt that the
Flash is faster than Sonic (especially in the more rfecent comics).  I
mean, he can outrun LIGHT.  Even with a DOZEN power rings the Blue
Streak can't match that.
    OTOH, the hedgehog is far COOLER, which is what's REALLY important.

    Have to go with the Flash on this one guys... but I'd consider 
Sparkster the Rocket Knight a pretty worthy candidate too (if he 
could ever do continuous flight.  Just to add a little fuel to the 
fire.

Well, I just thought of this, but I think if Tim Allen would do a 
voice, he would do mabe Knuckles? or Jack Ni<you know who> might do 
Mecha Sonic? remeber, these were never n the show so think about it.

Hi there, fellow Sonic fans.

I would like to make a list with all the episode titles from the weekday =
=20
Sonic cartoon (you know... the one with Scratch, Grounder and Coconuts). =
 =20
Alas, all I got from my local TV network was a list with the _german_ =20
titles (I live in Germany, and of course the german titles are totally =20
different to the american ones).  Now I need your help to complete the =20
list:

Anyone who has seen any of the weekday Sonic cartoons, please send me =
the =20
episode title, the author(s) and a few sentences describing what the =20
episode was about, so I can find it on the list I have.  If you remember =
=20
the names of some characters that appeared only in this episode, please  =

add them too.

If you all support this, maybe I can soon post a list with all the =
german =20
_and_ american episode titles of the weekday Sonic cartoon.  Please send =
=20
your infos to

        weekday@deco.franken.de

There are 65 episodes of the weekday cartoon, so I need every support I  =

can get here :)

Thanks in advance

Blah blah spoilers blah blah blah



#35  [June 1996]
     "Ring of Truth," (in 3 parts)
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     The story starts out in total game mode, with Sonic being
chased by Robotnik and losing his accumulated power rings along
the way (a situation to which I can, unfortunately, relate). 
While dodging Robotnik's maceball he grabs at a ring that causes
him to disappear.  Robotnik's onboard computer has been keeping
count of the number of rings Sonic has grabbed in the course of a
lifetime [how convenient!  Maybe Robotnik can find honest work as
a baseball statistician!] and it turns out that was the
1,000,000,000th power ring.  Never mind that, in the animated
series, Sonic can only access one ring a day.  We're dealing with
some different realities here.
     Sonic finds himself transported into another dimension,
where dwell the Ancient Walkers.  He is told that it is his
billionth ring and that his reward will be...knowledge.  Or a
copy of the home game, it depends.  Our hero finds himself
falling toward a green sea.  Turns out it's green because it's
made up, not of water, but of chaos emeralds.  The billionth
ring, following him around like a spaniel, breaks his fall.  A
second Walker, wearing a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament for no
particular reason, challenges Sonic to solve the Riddle of the
Rings.  Sonic guesses the answer and is buried by coiled chains
of power rings for his trouble.  Their accumulated weight drag
him down under the sea of emeralds where, rat-like, he is forced
to run on the inside of the aforementioned power ring.  He
confronts the third Walker who subjects him to one of the oldest
gags in the business.  There follows an entirely useless page of
Sonic trying unsuccessfully to make sense out of the preceding
eleven pages until, finally, he emerges back in his own
dimension, ring in hand, disabling Robotnik's hover unit in the
process.
     Gallagher gets major points for stretching, for writing a
story beyond the Sonic Vs. Robotnik And If You Have To Wonder Who
Will Win Then You Must Be New In Town genre.  Aside from the
small problems with this story (the billion ring business, the
"Playboy" pun that misfires), there's a more fundamental flaw. 
And since "Prof. Fulop" invited "scholarly" evaluations (in a box
on page 14) I humbly submit:
             A COMPARISON OF THE STRUCTURE OF "RING OF TRUTH"
                 WITH THE MESOPOTAMIAN "EPIC OF GILGAMESH"
     The Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates back to the first
millennium BCE, is a prototypical tale of a hero's quest.  "Ring
of Truth," on the other hand, deviates from the Gilgamesh model
in several important ways:
     In Gilgamesh, the hero at one point undertakes a quest. 
This quest has a purpose: to obtain a magic flower that will undo
the death of Gilgamesh's best friend, Enkidu, who died as a
result of their fighting against the Bull of Heaven.  Sonic,
however, stumbles upon the zone of the Ancient Walkers strictly
by accident.  He just happened to grab the requisite number of
rings.  It really doesn't count as a "quest" if it's accidental. 
The same weakness showed up in "Southern Crossover, Part 3,"
where Tails just has the events of Mobian prehistory channelled
through him to no obvious purpose or benefit.
     The second flaw in the story "Ring of Truth" involves
Sonic's inability to learn from what has happened (and to impart
said knowledge to the reader).  For Gilgamesh, his quest ends
when, having obtained the flower, it is taken from him by a
serpent and the god Utnapishtim delivers the punch line: that in
life there are no second chances.  By page 14 of "Ring of Truth,"
on the other hand, all we are left with is a metaphysical
mishmosh that gives Sonic a headache and which offers the reader
a number of meanings to choose from:
     A.   Yes!
     B.   This Isn't Fair!
     C.   Forty-Two!
     D.   Some Of The Above!
     It doesn't help matters that his "guides" on the path of
enlightenment are less than convincing.  Since their debut in
"Tttriple Tttrouble" [Game Gear Adaptation #1], the Ancient
Walkers have been saddled with the burden of Dave Manak's
artwork.  Our hedgehog hero is up against some heavy cosmic
stuff; Manak, however, manages to transform "cosmic" into
"comic."  His Walkers look like people wearing rather
unconvincing rubber dinosaur suits and masks that look like they
belong on the walls of Trader Vic's or some other tiki and
tropical drink bar.  Even Spaziante's sparse cover rendering of
the same masks cannot save them from looking, quite frankly,
ridiculous.  A little more thought in this story could have
prevented it from ending up as a lot of mystical sound and fury,
signifying nothing.
     "A Sense of History, Part 2"
     Story and Art: Ken Penders
     As Knuckles continues to flash back, it is now about four
generations after Echidnapolis went airborne thanks to the
installation of a dozen chaos emeralds.  Two echidna brothers,
Edmund and Dmitri, survey the chaos chamber where the emeralds
continue to radiate.  Their proposal to return the floating
island to the ground by means of a "chaos syphon" that would
gradually leach power from the stones, is sharply denied by the
scientific establishment who aren't in a mood to tamper with the
forces of nature.  Enraged by such narrowmindedness, Dmitri uses
the prototype of the syphon on the emeralds.  It succeeds in
reducing eleven of the twelve stones to charred shards and
transforms Dmitri into a being with "the energies of eleven
shattered chaos emeralds howling within him." [Note to Ken
Penders: Great line!]  Dmitri then either calls forth, or else
morphs into, Mount Fate.  To be continued.
     Now THIS is more like it!  If you're going to be mystical,
you can be linear about it as well.  So how exactly does echidna
civilization come to an end?  THAT'S what I call a tease.  This
just about makes me forget about all those 2-month vamps.
     Sonic-Grams, etc.:  The cover of #36 is interesting, not
just because Spaz has given us yet another tail shot of Sally,
but because she and Sonic apparently come face to helmet with one
of Sauron's Black Riders.  That's a High Concept plot for you:
Mobius meets Middle Earth!  I can only hope that this "quest"
isn't an ongoing excuse to put Sonic et al. in different settings
outside Mobius.  By me, it would be a tacit admission that the
writers had run dry and they couldn't come up with any more story
ideas involving the basic concept.  We'll know better next month.
     Great, Scott!  You're outta here!  Then again, Ken Penders
has spoken of you in the past tense for some time now, so the
move must've been a done deal by the time this went to press. 
Ken also said Scott quit to pursue some writing.  Let's see: he
contributed six editorial boxes to "Ring of Truth" and ten to
"Crash of the Titans."  So why am I not surprised that he wanted
to write?  Let's hope Fred Mendez does a better job of keeping
his ego in check.  Letters: a Canadian reader contributes a Sonic
rap and manages to finish each line without including the word
"Eh?".  The other letter (there are only two) asks if Knuckles
has hands inside his gloves [no, they're hooks, you little...let
us pause a moment to weep for this younger generation], and asks
whatever happened to the ABC series.  Scott shines him off by
blaming Robotnik's stranglehold on the mainstream media and by
saying that Sonic was too fast for the time slot.  OK, I'm also
disappointed that he didn't advise the kid to read my FAQ File. 
Maybe Fred knows enough to credit the computer-literate among the
readership.  Heck, you ever count how many commercials are now
featuring the addresses of Web pages?  Our day will come, Cyber-
Mobians!

The only example I have seen, to date, was when Uncle Chuck himself got 
roboticized, from Blast to the Past. Since I don't have any equipment for 
making AVIs, I just though I might help point you in the right direction.

Kiken here, from the looks of things, unfortunately no. You may get lucky 
and locate a fan subbed version several months from now, but even that is 
pushing things. 

First, right now, as has been mentioned before, the 
anime is rental-only. So no companies are permitted to really purchase 
mass quantities of it. This is changing May 31 though.

Second, in the US there is already an established 
animated series (two actually), that portray Sonic in a light acceptable 
by US standards, the Japanese portrayal and standars are much different: 
such things as bad language (numerous 4 letter words), obscene or 
offensive gestures and extreme violence are accepted in Japanese 
animation. Out of the above three criterion, the obscene gestures and bad 
language are present in the Sonic anime, I don't know about any extreme 
violence as of yet.

Third, even if a subtitling company, such as Anime Eigo, Manga Corps US, 
Pioneer, Newtype or any of the others out there, grabbed up the anime, 
getting the rights to release it in the states would be very difficult, 
since Sega of America partially own anything with Sonic the Hedgehog in 
it. They would legally have to ask SOA permission in order to release the 
anime here.

Fourth, becuase of the second reason, even if the anime is released here, 
its probably gonna be editted and censorred (BOOO!) to fit the US 
standard. 

As I said above, if you don't understand Japanese, your one hope right 
now is that some little company will find it and fan-sub it. As for 
dubbing the anime, YUCK!!! Dubbed anime blows! Any fan will tell you 
that. Even if the US got the cast from the US show to do it, it just 
wouldn't be the same. But as of right now, even trying to get ahold of an 
original Japanese copy is VERY hard! Luckily not impossible, NewType 
Magazine (a Japanese manga/anime publication) listed volume 1 of the 
Sonic Anime as a purchasable OVA, for 5974 Yen (approximately $60). Seems 
like I'm gonna be writing them some mail as well.

More on this later.

I liked my "Ring of Truth" better, myself.  It's a tad more believable.

I won't make the obvious pun.  (Sandra'd get angry at me.)  Instead,
I'll just politely tell you that I'm pretty sure that's not how the
German word for the homeland is.  I believe it's "Deucheland" or
something similar to it.  =)

I just got a magazene that had a small article of the Sonic anime flick.  
I'm gonna scan it for rat.org, then call DIC to get this movie imported 
NOW!!

It's only a half hour, I think they can cram it all without much 
doctoring up...

Kiken here, the last people I want to see messing with the Sonic Anime 
are DIC. If anyone picks it up, it better be Manga Corps US or AnimEigo. 
I trust those two companies for accuracy of translation, and there are 
two episodes total. But I guess you didn't quite read all of my previous 
post. "Doctored" would not be the word. As I said, let the anime fans 
translate this, and like I said, its rental-only, Sega Enterprises are 
not mass producing it yet. 
 

Kiken signing off.

I agreed to it before I learned it was warez (pirate software).
And I'm not about to put warez on rat.org. Sega already isn't overly fond
of me, I don't want to give them legal ammunition.

    Even then, I'm afraid (Although with the Deep Power Stones, it's
close).  However, the hedgehog in SS mode is somewhat tougher than the
Flash, physically.  But the rings eventually burn out, while ol'
Flasheroo simply keeps on going and going and going-- Hmm... Perhaps the
Mobius equivalent of the Flash aint a hedgehog after all, but a
drum-beating pink bunny?  OUCH.

A Sonic the Hedgehog story called "The Brawl" will be out in Bookshire's
story page, soon. The only detail I'm giving out is that there is a new FF
with the same name of a character in the story "Jaded Views" by Thad "X"
Boyd. Guess... it's KABUKI! A character I created a year back (or was it
less than that). But the character "Kabuki" in the story is an alternate
character and she's MORE competitive. Both with the same "Kabuki" name,
different first and last name. That's all I'm saying for now.

I've heard about this a long time ago, but I never said it to anyone.
(except for X and Amaroq) I heard it from a friend. What he told me that it
was VERY violent. I DO remember every single detail what he told to me, the
setting and character action. I'm not telling though. <G>

DIC doing anime? I shudder when I think of the possible results! C'mon, if
you haven't ever watched dubbed anime, let me tell you, DON'T. DON'T waste
your time. There are way too many problems with it. (This is true in
general.) Whenever anime gets dubbed, the characters' personalities are
almost always changed, never for the better. Go with the subtitles and read
a little. Dubbed anime is not "doctored." Butchered is more like it.

    Just a request, folks, but when you put a story on the web-page, 
would you please format it to 80 characters? It's kind of annoying to have
to scroll *waaaaaay* right because the entire paragraph is displayed as a 
single line, and Netscape apparently has no word-wrap feature for plain 
text files...
                                  Thanks..

Kiken here, that was WEAK! Sega should cut that out, not to mention the 
needless mud-slinging at Sony. If you wanna joke about your own 
character, that's fine, but don't use it as an excuse to point fingers at 
someone else for something. Not to mention their pathetic coverage of 
"Nights" by Sonic Team.

The only problem is that fanfic authors have to try to write their 
stories in formats that look good to people viewing them with many 
different programs and using many different monitors, many of which can't 
fit more than 78 characters on a line.  So, whether they use 78 or 80 
characters, their stories are going to appear messed up to some.  
Besides, reformatting long stories is a MAJOR pain in the you-know-what.

You've got to be kidding!  No word-wrap?  That feature's an absolute must 
nowadays!  Even Windows Notepad has it (though you do have to 
specifically activate the feature every time you run Notepad).

I require all fanfic to be word wrapped before getting into the Gargoyles
section of my site. I don't run the Sonic fanfic, so I can't say what the
rules are there. 
Word wrapping is easy! Get UltraEdit for Windows at 
http://rat.org/pub/msdos and it's under the "edit" menu called "convert 
wrap to CR/LF".
If you have Macintosh, get BBedit. Try one of the info-mac mirrors to get 
a copy of that.

Netscape does not have word wrap for text files (at least I didn't see 
anything about it). So I agree that textfile should be word wrapped. If 
you don't want to use text, then do it in Word, but the disadvantage is 
you can't click on it in Netscape and read it. You have to download it, 
and load up Word to view it.

Ok, this is WAAY off topic. Let's not continue this thread on too much,
OK?

Does Ultraedit run on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95?  My computer with 
Windows 3.1, and it won't run the program.  If it's for Win '95, is there 
a similar program for 3.1 or DOS?  Also, I use WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS as 
a word processor.  Will Ultraedit for Windows work on WordPerfect for DOS 
files?

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

The Sonic mailing list opened on 4 February 1995.  This is a medium-
volume list; you can normally expect to receive 8-15 list messages
per day (though variations can and do occur).

As a list subscriber, you are responsible for knowing and following
the rules and guidelines in this document.  Please read it carefully.

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  The digest version lets you get all of
the list messages in one convenient daily package.  You may change
your subscription status from "live" to digest or from digest to
"live" at any time.  If you decide to change your subscription status,
be sure that you unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore,
or you will be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages
twice.  See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

In the event you should ever be roboticized, here is the correct
procedure for unsubscribing.  Send mail to majordomo@lists.mv.net.
In the text area, place "unsubscribe sonic" or "unsubscribe
sonic-digest" (without the quotes) on the first line and "end" (also
without the quotes) on the second line.  Leave the Subject: line
blank.  Allow 36 hours for your request to take effect.  DO NOT
SEND UNSUBSCRIBE REQUESTS TO THE POSTING ADDRESS.  THE SERVER WILL
NOT PROCESS REQUESTS SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net.
This address applies to both versions of the list.  Do not try to
send list messages to any other address, or your post may not go
through.  If you feel you must flame someone, please do so in e-mail
directly to that person.  Let's focus on fighting Robotnik rather than
each other.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters and
stories in the Sonic comics, cartoons, and fan fiction, as well as
information and opinions on the marketing of Sonic-related products.
You may post messages on the Sonic games to the extent that the focus
is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or characters, and not on the games
themselves.  Asking why a game character rarely appears in the comics
is on-topic, but asking how to become "Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.
If you are interested in the Sonic games too (or instead), please see
the "Other Internet Resources" section below.

Please do not post any of the following types of material: files,
commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.  If you do,
you are subject to immediate removal from the list and suspension or
termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt, please contact
the list manager before posting.  Sonic-related fan fiction, images,
and sounds may be uploaded or e-mailed (See "WWW/FTP Site" below for
more information.)  Administrative and technical issues concerning
the list should also not be posted.  These messages should be sent
to sonic@rat.org or rat@rat.org.

Some fans are creating a Sonic game playable on PC's.  Most discussions
concerning this game belong in the Twisted Mettle mailing list and NOT
the Sonic mailing list.  See "Other Internet Resources" below for
more information.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read them
before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from the Web
site as http://rat.org/pub/sonic/text as faq-dd.txt and faq-jf.txt.
The Sonic Merchandise List can be found in the same directory.  See
"WWW/FTP Site" below for more information.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
messages, send the command "get sonic mail.txt" (but without the
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo@lists.mv.net; leave
the Subject: line blank.

How To Change Your Status
=========================
To change from "live" to digest, send this text inside a message to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic-digest
    unsubscribe sonic
    end

To change from digest to "live", send this text inside a message to

Sega and Archie on the Sonic Mailing List
=========================================
We are very fortunate to have representatives of Sega and Archie Comics
as subscribers to the Sonic list.

Mike Wallis of Sega reads the list and sometimes posts Sega's viewpoints
on Sonic-related issues.

Editor Paul Castiglia and writer Ken Penders of Archie Comics are also
list subscribers.  You may send e-mail to them at benny7dude@aol.com
(Paul) and KenP7672@aol.com (Ken).  All messages will be read, but please

Well, I just picked up Sonic #35 today, and am reading the reviews on the 
list now.  He was hard to catch this month!  He sold out really faaassst
at the comic stores I usually find him (within 3 days of arrival), but
thankfully the 4th location I tried had one copy left.  I better renew
my subscription right away! :-)

Maybe if you count all the copies of Sonic games sold, times the number
of times each one has been played, times the number of rings Sonic collects
each time he runs, you might come up with a number close to 1 billion.
Maybe even a U.K. billion. (10^12 rather than 10^9 :-)

> This story seemed a bit too strongly based on the games for me.

I rather liked the premise of "Ring of Truth", it was like a glimpse
into the Mobian supernatural.  I was in suspense for the whole story, 
not knowing _what_ to expect -- as anything could happen!

It was kind of cool to see things from the early issues again,
like Dr. R's Checker Wrecker Ball (but called his Mega-Maceball this time). 
I think it bears certain similarities to the Amiga Boing Ball (from the 
first Amiga demo, Boing!  The colour scheme is different, though).

> But the Manak/Koslowski art was OK...

Yep, it looks like Manak has been taking hints from Spaz, like interesting
viewing angles.  His artwork lends an "early issue" feel to this story,
which ties in very nicely with some of the fundamental developments for the
Mobian world mythos shown in this issue.

> Other references from other shows: "Big Bird", and "hokey smokes"

Maybe they are expressions Sonic picked up from being in two TV shows
himself? :-)  B.B. and Rocky & Bullwinkle have become part of N.A. culture.
(I've been watching R&B again since I noticed YTV was airing it at 4:00 AM.
Turns out I was missing half the jokes when I saw it as a kid. :-)

Yeah, it bugged me that Gallagher didn't get the grammar quite right.  Unless
it was intentional.  Since "ye" is plural, the 3rd Walker is addressing the
_readership_, as well as Sonic.  And I'd wager that the boon we have been
granted is the Sonic Movie.  :-)

"What hidden meaning am I supposed to get from this?" and "Nothing is hidden
-- only unseen!" could then be interpreted (for us) as "This story/issue
contains some _mondo-major_ hints!".  

And then there's this SonicQuest -- it sounds like a story arc for future
issues of the Sonic comic, but could it be the Movie instead?  (How can you
tell I'm getting really hyped up about the Sonic Movie already?  :-)

> Page 12:  I thought a sideways figure-eight was the symbol for infinity, not

So Sonic isn't that great at math...

> Page 13:  The 3rd walker's answer reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode 
            [with a mathematician and the Devil]

Cool!  So being good at math doesn't help one much when talking with
supernatural beings.

In the panel in the middle of page 10, are we looking along the axis of 3 
chains twisted around one another?  It's hard to tell, so I just took
Sonic's word for it.  I wonder if a triple-helical DNA-like molecule,
that can encode information and triplicate itself, could really exist?

Linked rings have all sorts of magical overtones. ("The Linking Ring" is
even the title of a magicians' journal.)

> New editor Fred Mendez...
				   
I noticed that Freddie is also the editor of _Street_Sharks_, which seems to
have replaced Sonic in 7-11's around here. :-(  (And also in the canned pasta
department of the grocery stores.)  At least it has a "Sonic Checklist" page.
Makes sense in light of the Street Sharks cartoon, I suppose.

> Rather weird Anime/video game-like representation of Sonic and Tails on the 
> last page...

That must be a _huge_ hint, about something.  Characters in Virtua Fighter are
rendered like that, so it's probably a hint about Fighting Sonic.  Characters
in computer-generated animation (like ReBoot) are also modelled in wireframe,
which looks something like this page too, so maybe the Archie Sonic team got
to see some of the work-in-progress on the Sonic Movie.

       Actually, it already does. Where do you think bureaucrats come 
from? ;-) (You must fill your DNA out in triplicate... ;-)  )


       BTW, I think that maybe a *million* rings would have been a more 
appropriate value there--after all, in the average game, Sonic picks up a 
few thousand rings during play--and in the comic, he's been doing that 
for several years now.

not to nit pick myself, but sometimes things are written or drawn in a comic
because the writers and artistes have imangations (ecusse my bad spelling),
of course sometimes the  writers and artistes have been known to play trixes
on their readers.

Hi there!

Yes I ve noticed it!
Hey! What=B4s the best IRC channel to connect to?
There are five different channels of IRC where to connect.
And I personally would like to try it,and I need the best channel because my

I got the same thing. I'm guessing the list-owner had some trouble and he
had to resubscribe us all.

When I saw that picture in Sonic #17, and I remember all the "Is Sally a 
squirrel or a fox" posts, I decided to scan the picture and put it into 
Ratman's FTP site, to help resolve that issue.

What you received is an update to the list's intro text.  I post it to 
the list every time there is an update to be sure everyone gets a chance 
to see it.  I will also repost it from time to time as a reminder of the 
list's policies.

You can always review the intro text by sending these 2 lines:
 info sonic
 end
to majordomo@lists.mv.net in the text area of a message (leave the 
Subject: line blank).

I plan on (finally!) writing the update to the list's Web page over the 
next few days.  Then we'll have 3 FAQ's, the third one being a FAQ for 
the list itself.  For those without Web access, the important information 
will continue being placed in the intro text.

I noticed!  It looks like 'waypast' is Ratman's bot, there to keep
the channel open.

Okay everybody, as you might have noticed there's a new section on the Sonic
Resource page that explains how to participate in Sonic chat on IRC. If you
hadn't noticed, you better go look soon! (Everything you need to know can be
found there.)

While the channel is there all the time, I was hoping that we could set up
"official" hours when most of us could be there at the same time. Once or
twice a week would probably be the best for everybody, but I don't want to
pick a time that's inconvenient for a lot of people. If you could all write
to me (NOT TO THE LIST!) with suggestions for a convenient time, it would
make this a lot easier. I realize that we have fans on the list from all
over the world. I'll try to be accomodating, even if you are 16 hours out of
sync with me. 

If you have any questions about chat, just send me e-mail. To reiterate,
please DO NOT send questions to the list or to Ratman. Write to me ONLY.

Any feedback on the Sonic chat WWW pages is welcome, as well.

If you're ever on the channel, my nickname is MilesProw. I am the channel
operator, along with the bot.

I hope to see you there!

        Yo,
        Now, for the $10,000.00 question.  What is Sonic's max. speed (with
power ring).  What is Sonic's max. speed (without power ring).  I've seen
the question in Sonic-Grams lots of times, but the real speed is never said.

OK, guys.  This is in response to previous posts asking
for Sonic's velocity (with and without power rings).  I
saw the figures in a previous post last year regarding
this.  My numbers might be off (read:  currently unable
to verify), but here's what I remember seeing:

Without power ring:  300 mph (approx. 482.8 kph)
With power ring:     1000 mph (approx. 1.6 Mph, that's
                     megameters per hour, or if you
                     prefer, 1600 kph)

        Hi,
        Someone said that Sonic with a power ring goes 1000 mph.  Well then,
if Sonic had the Deep Power Stones....  Let's see, the Power Stones are
10,000 times power rings, that would make Sonic travel at 10,000,000 mph.,
now THAT'S fast.

Eek. Wouldn't his flesh and skin rip off at that speed? Eyeballs shoot into
the back of his head? Spines shoot into the air, impaling people behind him?

Ugh, I can see that I just painted some pretty pictures. Sorry.

I don't think Sonic has a limt when he is using the power ring.
It's just depends how much he needs and how much he can handle.
There was a story writen some temperal syndom that uses this idea.
In the end he died from over use.

Ummm... besides that... aren't they cartoons? :P heh... isn't there an
entire cartoon physics that takes over?  I mean.. things happen 'cause it's
in the script not 'cause physics says so. :P

    Sorry, netburp.  To finish, nowhere near the speed of the typical
spandex-clad speedster in your mainstream superduper comic.  But, not to
be sneezed at either.
    Also, from watching Doomsday, I'm not so sure that the energy of the
DPS's were translated entirely into speed.  There was a lot of it taking
the form of a nigh-impenetrable bubble of force around Sonic & Sally.
And a lot taking te form of destructive energy having little or nothing
to do with speed.

The only 2 references to speed in 'real' numbers I've ever seen in either
the shows or the comic books.  Both were in the Saturday AM series.

In the 'Sonic Racer' episode, Robotnik sets up a race in order to
draw out Sonic.  Sonic's main rival is a Cheeta-bot which Robotnik earlier
tested at 500 mph going 'half speed' (i.e. 1000 mph full speed). 

In a different episode, Robotnik was able to get a Power Ring in order to
power his 'Sonic Radar'.  The Radar was designed to pick up only those
objects going faster than sound (i.e. Sonic).  There were also a number of
times, in the first season especially, when we heard Sonic breaking the
sound barrier without using a power ring. 

These shows imply that Sonic's 'normal cruzing speed' is somewhere between
800 mph (faster than sound) and 1000 mph ('slow' enough so that the
Cheeta-bot would provide tough competition) [speed rounded to nearest 100
mph]

As far as power rings go we've NEVER seen any references to real speeds
when he uses one of them... I can only guess that the biggest upper limit
would be orbital velocity (about mach 25 on Earth).  I've always assumed
it was about mach 3 or 4 for no particular reason.

Also... something to note about power vs speed... From what I remember in 
physics class:
*  to double your speed  you need to  double the power
      only works in laminar flow situations... when air (or other medium
      such as water) flows smoothly around an object passing through it.
      In air this is probably less than walking speed (3 mph)

*  to double your speed  you need to  Octuple (8x) the power
      is more accurate for turbulent flow situations... when air swirls
      around an object passing through in complex eddies and waves 
      (e.g. an oar through water).
  
I'm not sure if this holds for super-sonic speeds but if it does, then 
comparing Sonic's speed with power ring vs the deep power stones would 
give you this:
          power ring = 1     deep power stones = 10000
     speed with ring = x     speed with stones = 21.5 x


Anyway... I just thought I'd add more confusion to this argument.

        Hey guys,
        How fast is the speed of sound through air, anyway?  My computer
only says 1,087 ft. per sec., but I don't know how fast that is in mph.

sonics red sneaks are fricton resistant as for the wind maybe its some kind
of mutation unique to sonic (after all mutations are quite natural in nature)

1,087 fps comes out to 741.136 mph, I do believe.

1087 * 60 * 60 / 5280

All this talk about Sonic's speed has reminded me of a couple questions 
I've been meaning to ask.  In the Saturday AM show, the other Freedom 
Fighters often grabbed hold of him and rode behind him as he juiced.  How 
did they ever hold onto him while he was moving that fast?  Also, wouldn't 
whoever was directly behind Sonic get impaled on his quills when he stopped 
suddenly?  (Ewww!  That could be nasty!)

Heh... N E wayz, in the realm of cartoons, no one considers that stuff! Just
enjoy the fact that no one was impaled and that they're still around, dude.
Oh, and I just was wondering.... does anyone own a real Hedgehog? My friend
does (named it Sonic of course.)

Well, I suppose if you look at it from the "Cartoon Physics" point of view,
none of this matters. There was a good example of this in that "The Real
Ghostbusters" cartoon series almost 10 years ago. They were all transported
to a cartoon world, and Egon, logical as ever, couldn't adjust. "Egon! Help
me move this lake!" "You cannot pick up a lake and move it! It's illogical!"
It was pretty weird, but it was funny. 

But, if you look at it from the real world physics point of view, yeah. When
Sonic stops, he would have quite a mess to peel off of his back. Holding
onto something that's going faster than mach 1 (Mach 1 is the speed of
sound) wouldn't be possible (Obviously). 

I have to go in for the cartoon explanation. The force of friction from the
air alone would be enormous. Unless there were some kind of genetic mutation
that protected Sonic from affects like that. This hasn't really been
explained, yet. 

A note to all of you trying to figure out the Physics of it: Using The U.S.
system of measurements rarely works. Most of the laws of physics were
defined using the metric system. Use meters, not miles.

I assume what they did was (considering that this is cartoon physics)
make Sonic's quills sharp when he wanted or needed them to be. :)  If
not, noone would've been able to hitch a ride on Sonic's back, period.
As for the wind generation and other associated forces with the high
velocity, well...Hedgehog doesn't have a nav deflector array.  How any-
one stays on is anyone's guess.  Rack it up to cartoon physics again.

As far as I know of, no one on the list has a pet hedgehog.

For those of you interested in this, check out these pages:
  http://www.pci.on.ca/~macnamar/velcro.html
  http://fohnix.metronet.com/~mcgary/hedgehogs.html
  http://www.primenet.com/~khyri/hedgehog/
I haven't checked these pages recently, so it's possible 1 or more of the 
URL's could be outdated.

If someone on the list does have a 'hog, why not take a picture and scan 
it for your page (assuming your provider gives you space for a page).

Actually, I think they would fly ahead of him when he stopped. But didn't I

     Epilogue

     Son-Ak was somewhat uncomfortable.  Fine clothes weren't his
favorite idea, even after these months in the Princess's court.
The magician, Antos, still didn't seem to like him any better, even
if he now trusted him.  Bunnie, at least, was now more of a friend.
The accidental rescue by the twin-tailed one had elevated a street-
thief to the court as a ward of the Crown, and his four friends had
been adopted, in a fashion, by the housekeepers of the Palace.
     And all of them know that Roboth-Amon would strike again, for
dark wizards are known for their refusal to accept failure.  The
incursions of the golems at the borders were growing more frequent,
and there was still the matter of the shadowy figure that young
Milos had mentioned that night he had saved the Princess and met
Son-Ak.
     Odd, that.  It had turned out that Milos was the one who had
purloined Son-Ak's purse, and far from being foes, the hedgehog had
soon found himself a object of hero-worship by the young vulpine.
     A page-- the child-cat named Cleth, appraoched Son-Ak.
"M'Lord,"  he said, as though he was reciting a lesson-- which, in
fact, he was-- "It is time."
     And once again, as he had every day for the last three months,
Son-Ak drew a blue and red cloak over his new chain-mail, hefted
his axe (the only person besides Captain Rabbot to bear arms in the
presence of the Princess), strode up the aisle to the throne, and
took his place at the right-hand side, as the herald announced his
presence--
     "Lord Sonic of the Cad-Hai, Champion of the Crown."
     "Princess," Son-Ak whispered, "Could you do SOMETHING to get
that fool to pronounce my name right?"


     The End.

     A Rennaisance Mouse Production


    So, there it is.  Whaddya think, sirs?

     Salar-Alicia was not, as might have been guessed, a frail
flower of gentility or anything else so inane.  Neither was she a
warrior, though, and warrior or not the sight of two of Roboth-
Amon's Iron Golems stepping through her mirror would startle-- and
panic-- anyone.
     It certainly didn't do much for the Princess' nerves at the
moment.  As the guardsman and the Hedgehog burst into her quarters,
the swordbunny close behind with the sorcerer, they froze at the
tableau.
     "We cannot attack, lest we harm ze princess,"  whispered
Antos.
     "Can't just stand here, mage," hissed Son-Ak.
     "Ah don't suppose y'all got a better idea?" added Bunnie, her
distress allowing her southlander accent to bleed through.
     Outside the window, a shadow-cloaked figure watched.  Sniv,
master thief, spy, and assassin, viewed the scene with mixed
satisfaction and horror.  A job well done, certainly, and his
master would be pleased at it's efficiency, but he had never felt
comfortable around the implacable golems of Roboth-Amon.  He was
certain that he never would.
     Discomfited as he was, though, he could not repress a grin of
satisfaction as another golem stepped through the mirror.  Whatever
else others might think, Sniv did his job well.  He saw no possible
flaw in the "exercise" this night.
     Below the window, Milos and his charge were approaching the
palace, preparing to wind about to the rear, and the kitchen doors.
The little fox had always had sharp eyes (a dull-eyed thief tends
not to last long-- not with both hands, at any rate) and he was
noticing something almost invisible up higher on the wall.
Thinking in terms of a master burglar, an idea came to him.
     "Cleth,"  he told the kitten, "Wait here.  I wanna get a look
at that guy.  Maybe I can learn something."
     "What guy?"  Cleth asked.  "I don't see no guy, Tails."
     Tails grinned.  "That's one of the MANY reasons why I am your
fearless leader, little one."
     "I thought it was because you could thump Raffer whenever he
gets out of line," replied the kitten doubtfully.
     "That too," agreed Tails.  "Wait here-- in the shadows.  I'll
be right back."
     Stepping to one side, out of sight of any passers-by, Milos
doffed his cloak and once again began to spin the twin tails that
had given him his nickname.  He rose up from the littered streets,
into the air-  and, incidentally, destiny.


     As a fourth golem began to emerge from the mirror, Son-Ak
decided to make his move.  Stepping forwards, he slowly placed his
axe at his feet, in a gesture of apparent surrender.
     Watching from his citadel in the Eastrealm, Roboth-Amon
smiled.  What had been planned as a test seemed to be developing
into a successful abduction instead.  He decided to indulge
himself.
     <<Apparently the previous altercation was, after all, a matter
of luck,>> came a gravelly voice from the mirror.  The glass
wavered, as though it were a pond that had been struck by a handful
of pebbles, and the face of the Dark Wizard appeared.
     It was not a pretty face.  Massive jowls framed a almost
conical head, with a black skullcap and a bristling red mustache.
Most would have called the race Human, but there was an undefinable
air of inhumanity about it.  Especially in the eyes-- eyes with no
whites, but instead black onyx-like sheen with tiny red pinpricks
of glow, like coals.  Whatever Roboth-Amon had been, years of
trafficking in dark magics had changed him into something else.
     << How unexpectedly fortunate it is,>> the apparition
continued.  <<I had planned a small test of the barbarian's
prowess.  Instead, I gain the princess as a... guest, as well as
one can hope surety of her father's co-operation.  When he returns
from his western journeys, he shall no doubt be more tractable than
in the past.>>
     Bunnie stood, unwilling to act while one of the golems held
her princess.  Antos tensed, holding power in his frame, but unable
to release it while the ground-squirrel was held. And Son-Ak--
grinned.
     "Prowess?", he murmured.
     Before anyone could react, the hedgehog leapt up into the air,
tucking into a roll.  Again, as he had in the tavern the day
before, he spun with inconceivable velocity, hurtling towards the
golem holding the Princess, this time slicing through the
restraining arm.  As Salar-Alicia fell, half-conscious, he
rebounded off the far wall, caught her, and half-spun, half-leaped
behind the swordbunny and the fox-mage.
     "Your turn, friends,"  Son-ak laughed.
     Antos suddenly snarled out something-- something in a language
that somehow Son-Ak could not quite hear, could not quite know.  A
Bright green blast of light erupted from his palms, shattering the
now- damaged golem.  As he turned to smite another, Bunnie drew her
great blade and attacked a third, wielding it with fearsome skill.
     Son-Ak handed the dazed Princess to the guardsman and
reclaimed his axe, and then erupted into the chilling battlecry of
his tribe.  Again the axe spun in a silvered circle, and again he
struck the remaining golem, shattering it's shell.  As he turned to
attack another, he saw Antos melt-- literally melt-- one of the two
remaining ones, and Bunnie, with what even he had to admit was
amazing skill, strike the final golem in it's visor, causing it to
shatter.
     "Yeeee----alllhhhhhhhhhh!"  Son-Ak screamed.  "Prowess, you
wanted, fat one?  THUS is the prowess of Son-Ak of the Cad-Hai, the
runner, the smiter, the warrior,--"
     << The insufferable.  If I cannot have my prize, then no one
shall.>>  The face faded from th mirror, just as it exploded, and
a dark, smoky burst of eldritch force struck the princess-- and
cast her out of the window.


     Fate.  It's out there.  It makes kings of vagabonds, jesters
of wise men, and hack fanwriters of computer students.  It can also
make a hero out of a ten year old fox, at the right moment.
     Milos had no idea what had happened.  Just as he had gotten to
the level of the window, all hell had-- apparently-- broken loose.
Perhaps it was some rich-person thing, he guessed.  Then the
chadowy figure had vanished, slipping into darker shadows, and a
figure suddenly flew out the window.
     Tails didn't think.  He simply reacted.  If some-one is
falling, you catch them.  And so he dove, grabbed a leg, and
desparately held on until he could lower the form to safety.
     Which is how Milos, Sneak thief, Gang leader, and half-
educated street-urchin, became the Ward of Salar-Alicia, Princess
of House Acorn, Heir to the throne of Mobius.  Had he known how his
life was to be upset, he might have let her fall.

     Other Sonics #1-- The Barbarian : Part Two

     By Robert Haynie

     Obligatory stuff-- Sonic the Hedgehog, Bunnie Rabbot, etc. TM
and copyright 1995 by Sega of America and Archie Comics.  They
probably reserve all rights.  This story is copyright 1995 Robert
S. Haynie Jr.  This is an exercise in fan fiction, and is not
meant to infringe on their rights, but is a purely recreational
exercise.  It may be duplicated freely, with the restrictions that
A) no text is changed, and B) no money is charged.


     Part the Fourth

     In a Darker world, the ones called Magi suggest that there is
no such thing as coincidence, that the shattered fragments of the
beginning of all things strive to rejoin and thus pattern all
occurrences and happenings towards that end.  Maybe.  But whether
cosmic forces compel happenstance towards a great destiny, or
whether crap just happens, Milos was about to have his lifestyle
severely reorganized.
     One would think that the prospect of such a thing would have
appealed to the street-thief.  But Tails knew his life, his
patterns of destiny, and was comfortable in them-- not from a
physical viewpoint, to be sure, but from an unstated spiritual one.
He knew his place in the world, as did his four charges, as did the
hedgehog and the princess and the swordbunny and the mage and the
spy, and especially the two thaumaturges.  For those who follow the
paths arcane know better than any how fragile a place is, how
mutable it can be... and Antos of Mobius and Roboth-Amon of the
Eastrealm knew instinctively that changes in places were coming.
     Antos' hope was to keep such changes from over-running the
kingdom and the princess he was bound to protect.  He hoped to
guide the princess, and through her the king (who was not fond of
magick) into paths that would allow the people to weather them with
the least amount of suffering and confusion.
     Roboth-amon, on the other hand, planned to ride the upcoming
changes, to mold them and all the world into a new reality-- one
where he would be like unto a god-- perhaps a god in fact,
immortal, invincible.
     And the two-tailed fox, knowing squat about these lofty,
eldritch, and arcane matters, hoped to con a kitchen-helper out of
some spare breadcrusts.  Well, we can't all be beings of great
insight and occult knowledge.


     Antos crouched in his chambers, his robe tossed aside, now
clad in a simple white loincloth and a chain about his neck, with
a single, rather unimpressive blue stone in the setting.  More than
one had wondered how one as young as he could perform the mage-
feats he had, and were they to see that, they would know.  After
all, there was power in a Chaos Emerald, even those which were not
the true green.  Add to that a naturally fastidious nature (which
helps in organizing the mind), native magickal talent (without
which no magery is possible), and a peculiar streak of sheer
bloody-mindedness (which is paramount in harnessing energies that
no-one in their right mind would even consider dealing with unless
they were magi), and you had one surprisingly capable sorcerer.
    Not an overconfident one, though.  Antos knew full well that if
it came to a open battle arcane between himself and the Dark
wizard, the result would be Dark Wizard:1, Antos:Immolation.  It
was only great distance and a natural talent for wards that had
kept the palace safe, and that could change any time.  That, and
constant vigilance...
     So, as he did each evening, Antos meditated, allowing his
senses to range out, attuning himself again to wards and charms he
had placed to alert him to any eldritch threat.  And, just as the
afternoon's audience had done, the gleam of power radiated from the
axe wielded by the barbarian, now ensconced in one of the guest-
chambers.
     A soft foot-step from behind Antos intruded on his
meditations, and he turned his head.  The guard-captain stood
behind him, frowning.
     "Few would entair un sorcerer's rooms without ze invitation,
Mon Capitaine."
     The frown was replaced by a smile, and Bunnie sat down next to
the fox.  "Ah didn't think Ah needed an invite, Antos," she
murmured, allowing herself to slip back to the dialect of her
southlands childhood.
     A half-smile crossed Antos' muzzle as the rabbit drew him into
a quick, but fierce, embrace.  "No, you are not needing one, mon
cher...  but still, it hardly seems proper for ze Captain of ze
Princess' Guard to be entering ze apartments of ze Sorcerair of
said Princess, nest pas'?  Zhere are always those whould suggest
plots et plans."
     "Let'em.  Ah just wanna snuggle a bit."  Bunnie sighed, and in
a wistful tone, added, "Ah just wish we could be open about us..."
     "Mais Non, Cher capitaine.  There are far to many in ze courts
zat play the game of the politics, and any sign of weakness would
call ze hunt down upon us.  And if either of us were to be
discredited, zen zat is but one more opening to ze Princess."
     Bunnie sighed.  "Ah know.  Speaking of threats, that
hedgehog--"
     "I am sensing no evil in him, Bunnie.  He is-- how is it
said?-- too clued to be a threat."
     Bunnie blinked.  "Too what?" she asked, drawing back in
confusion.
     "Too clued.  He is not subtle at all, he is not hiding
anything--"
     "Oh, y'all mean too CRUDE. Honestly, Antos, I may love that
accent of yours, but sometimes..."
     Bunnie rose, and left, then, to leave the sorcerer to his
work.  As she walked out, Antos mumbled, "I am having an accent?
Why is everyone telling me that I am having an accent?"


     Golden Fire.  Speed, speed, and more speed, rippling though
his corpus until he thinks he will shred from the strain, and still
the fire rages.  Seven stones, golden fire...
     As always, Son-Ak jerked awake just before the dream that had
haunted him since he was a child began to seem to make sense.  His
father's brother, tChak, a shaman of considerable wisdom (or so
the elders held him to be) claimed that the dreams could not--
would not be explained in the safe lands of his herding tribe.
Most people outside the northlands assumed that all the barbarian
tribes were filled with berserk warriors.  In actuality, the
berserkers were few and far between, but they did tend to be the
kind that the 'civilized' folk met.
     Son-Ak was no berserker, but he was a warrior of great skill
(As he would readily inform anyone who asked and most who did not)
and speed.  He was braver than most, he knew, and feared no man,
beast, or even demon-spawned sorcery (Well, he would not admit to
fearing the latter, at any rate).  Perhaps that is why the terror
that the recurring dream caused him upset him so.  It seemed
childish for a warrior of his stature and skill to wake up
sweating, shaking, barely repressing a scream of panic at the
recurring visions of gold fire-- or perhaps of rage at being
awakened just before some half-sensed revelation was to come to
pass...
     Just as he was about to return to a fitful sleep,  a scream
DID erupt-- but not from him.  The barbarian snapped upright as a
howl of terror came forth from somewhere else in the palace.  Even
as he grabbed his battleaxe, and stepped towards the door, a
guardsman slammed it open, crying "Hey, you--"
     "I heard," replied Son-Ak.  "Lead me there."

        As far as I know, I've never hurt myself, hugging Sonic (neither has
Uncle Chuck).  In fact, It makes me feel better.

        But usually, I carry the rider in my arms, like I do 4 Sally.  NEVER
once, has anyone even come close  to running into my quills!  I'm not THAT
careless!  Besides, I always make sure that whoever's hitched on me, is
always safe or doesn't let go.

        Hmmm...  Good point, Matt.  But I think Sonic's quills help break
down wind resistance.

Hm.. I am probably incorrect in this but if Sonic were running at a high
velocity as such, couldn't one or two FF hold on in the 'air pocket' is formed?
I have heard of a similar thing in racing...a car tags alng behind another,
using the whole the first car punches in the air to help itself along..

Just an idea..

I have heard of this. They would be shielded from the friction of the air,
so Sonic would bear the brunt of it. The problem of stopping on a dime would
still be a factor. Unless Sonic slowed down gradually, *SPLAT!* (Pretty
gross, I admit.) Sonic running by at top speed and grabbing somebody's arm
wouldn't be a good idea, either. I think we can picture the results. Most
unpleasant. 

Running as fast as he does is simply not possible on Earth. Maybe the Mobian
atmosphere has certain weird properties to it that shields him somehow? Or
even the buildup of static electricity? Unique poperties of the magnetic or
gravitational fields? Light waves from the Mobian sun? Mystical energies? 

Fan-fic authors, you could have a field day with this one! I'm just
finishing up my first year of college physics, so I'm probably not the best
one to be commenting on this from that standpoint. Do we have any physicists
on the list who can come up with something?

In Worcester, Massachusetts, the Sat AM Sonic has been moved to 9:30 AM.  
Just thought you'd like to know, since the show has probably been moved in 
other locales as well.  Worcester is served by Greater Media Cable.

Okay, first off, assuming that whowever is behind Sonic was shielded from
wind, they could move up to an speed, and even above light-speed (If you
believe that's possible without becoming energy and thus.. dying).
The only force pushing against the hog-rider would be acceleration, so for
an example let's assume the following scenario. Sonic accelerates to mach 1
in 10 seconds.

Mach 1 = 300M.s. (Or about 900-1000 Ft/s)
t = 10           (10 seconds)

a = v-u/t
a = 300/t

a = 30m.s. -2

{excuse my physics..}

Now gravity is only 10m.s...(let's assume Sally was clambering to his
quills) This means that Sally's weight, would be magnified to three times
what it normally is, and would be pulling in a direction opposite of Sonic's. 
To hold on Sally, would need to be able to hold up her own weight.. three
times over. Imagine that.. or to put it practically, imagine hanging off a
building with two people of your weight dangling from your legs!

Okay, now let's assume a Super Sonic stop.. mach 1 to zero in 3 seconds.
a = v-u/t
a = -300/3
a = -100m.s -2 deacceleration.

Sally would be squeezed with ten times her own weight up against Sonic.(Now
that's a lethal hug!) In reality this would not be happy.. she'd pass out
for sure. [Again, try to imagine nine people your weight - sitting one on
another on top of you!]

Well that leaves it all up to magic, mobian enviroment (Maybe their air is
very thin? Or their gravity is 30m/s.?) and imagination (Toon physics).

What about the 'dreaded' daily Sonic Series.  I've just started getting
used to them and all of a sudden I see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in that
time slot.

No need to repost.  Anyone who didn't receive any part can get the list 
archive from majordomo until the end of the month, and from the Web site 
starting next month.

As a reminder, stories should not be posted to the list.  You should 
e-mail stories to bookshire@rat.org.  You may announce your story to the 
list.  I also would not object to a brief summary in your new story 
announcement, up to about 1.5-2K long.  Please mark any summary to give 
readers a chance to not know anything about the story until actually 
reading it.

some of you may recall the Animaniacs stopwatch offer in conjunction with
Life cereal.  (It expired long ago, so don't ask about it now.)  Someone 
posted to alt.tv.animaniacs that he worked in a college camups cafeteria 
where they go through many boxes of Life.  He offered to give away proofs 
of purchase to the first xx (forgot the number) a.t.a'ers who asked for them.

Now, is anyone on the Sonic list a cafeteria worker (or good friends with 
one) and willing to help out similarly?  If so, please mail me directly 
(not on the list).  I'll compile the volunteer list and post it.

I've been struggling to get all 16.  But I keep getting the same ones, 
and that's when I can even find the specially marked boxes in my local 
supermarket.  Doh!

        HA ha ha ha!  Just kidding!  I wish (really)!  But now that I have
your attention, I was watching a (rerun) recording of "Sonic's Nightmare."
At the end, Sally and Sonic were back to back, OUCH!  Wouldn't that hurt
Sally?!  

        Oh, well I started it, I'll finish it.  Sonic says what a mondo
beautiful thing he's ever seen, Sally blushes,  you make my heart pound, my
mouth watter.  Yess, there's nothing like a chili dog!  "Oh, brother" is all
Sally had to say.

        I noticed this too, in California.  Sonic is on the USA Action
Extreme Team, here.  Sonic is also on Sunday here, not Sat.

And I also wanted to know the answer to the question I have been asking a
lot.... does ANYONE remember the story released years ago in which "Sonic"
wasn't the blue hedgehog's real name.... if so, what was it?!

"Life is a blast, as long as you don't stop to think about it!" -Sonic

    That's new.  Stories not posted to the list, that is.  Ever since
I've been here, (which is pretty much as long as it's been running, you
know) the list has seen a lot of fanfic.  Part one was posted to the
list at first, and was followed up here by simple logic.  When did the
no story on the list policy begin (I never saw that announcement)?  For
I fear that is news to me.  (Then agin, I like news.)

It's on Sunday here in Worcester, too (9:30am).  "Sat AM Sonic" is just
another name used on this list to refer to the show "Sonic the Hedgehog"
(it was originally on Saturday mornings on ABC) as opposed to "The
Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" (which is often called "the weekday
Sonic" on the list).  Sometimes "Sonic the Hedgehog" is also referred 
to as "ABC Sonic".  Sorry for the confusion.  It's just a bit of Sonic 
mailing list lingo.

Just so you know, I didn't write any of the above message.  Someone must 
have just replied to one of my messages and then forgotten to edit out my

More importantly, why is he writing the mailing list about it, and why 
did you answer him ON THE LIST?
Am I the only one that gets irritated at spam?

Hello all.

Due to problems I'd rather not go into, the odds are exceedingly high 
that I'll be losing this account within the week.  Hower, let me assure 
everyone that this is only a temporary thing.  I'll be establishing my 
own Internet Service/Furry BBS within the month and WILL be back to 
continue maintaining the Sonic short stories page.  Therefore, I'm issuing
the following Sonic-related instructions:

First, nobody attempt to send me any more short stories.  If you've sent 
me one within the last two months that hasn't been posted yet, just sit 
tight.  I may not get to it this month, but, once my net connections are 
all stable again posting them will be my FIRST priority.

Second.  From this point forward, send any questions and comments, chat, 
etc... to my college address at 67116@ef.gc.maricopa.edu

Third, to Ratman, please make the appropriate adjustment to me email 
address there to reflect my college address.

That's about it.  I'll also be unsubscribing from the list, or otherwise 
placing myself on 'vacation' or something.  I'll let all of you know as 
soon as my Internet Service, and 'net accessible Furry BBS is up and 
functioning and I ahve a new email address to go with it to send yoru 
stories and comments to.

Until then, long live Sonic the Hedgehog and Co.  It's been fun, and when 
I return to the list, I hope it's still fun.

PS - To my MUCK friends, my college has a copy of TF so my MUCK activity 
will NOT be affected by this.

Bye all

Okay everybody, since my last posting I have received close to zero
responses. There are over 100 people on this list and I only received
requests for a specific time to hold official sonic chat sessions from 3 people.

If you didn't get the last posting or otherwise ignored it, here's the gist
of it:

The sonic chat channel is officially open. I thank those of you who have
come to the channel and had some fun. As the channel operator, it makes my
job worthwhile to see you enjoying yourselves. If you have no idea what I'm
talking about, go to http://rat.org/sonic/irc/index.html, or follow the IRC
link on the Sonic Resource Page at http://rat.org/sonic/

I want to hold "official" sessions when most of you can be there. That's why
I left the door open for suggestions for times. I don't want to
inconvenience a lot of you. So, write to me at mpenna@vivanet.com and tell
me when it would be most convenient for you to be there, including what day
of the week would be best. I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

The channel is there 24 hours a day, so drop by and see who might be there.
Everybody is welcome, even if they're not a list subscriber. So, tell other
people about it, too. 

Please do not send any letters about Sonic chat to Ratman or to the list.
Send all mail to me ONLY. Thanks.

-Matt Penna

That doesn't work in all areas.  My local listings only show "Cartoon 
Express" without giving any indication as to which shows are on and when.

Nopenope.. I also get pretty irritated with it.. 'course I've made a few
OBVIOUS mistakes concerning the list. :P  But I'd like to think it's pretty
darn rare ('course I rarely post--but then, that's cause I wanna be on-topic
when I do).

Also... is it me... or are people forgettin' Sonic is a TOON? :P heh

When Sonic stops suddenly, how come people don't get bludgeoned when they
hang on?  heh--considering the weekday cartoon, I'm surprised nobody's
brought up ALL the physics that THAT series hasn't defied on more than a
dozen times in each show. :P heheh

AAAaaaaaaanywayz... folx.. simmer down 'n talk 'bout the show 'n stuff but,
as Mystery Science Theatre 3000 put it best, "If you wonder how they eat 'n
sleep, and other science facts.  Just repeat to yourself 'it's just a show,
I should really just relax.'"  :P

BTW:  (I gotz me two Sonic pogs. :P heheh  HEY!  It's a START!) :)

    Well, if Rat's started that, OK.  No hassle from here.  (Although it
needs to be mentioned in the newer editions of the Welcome, which still
approves fanfics.  Edit time!!!)

        Mine doesn't.  Both, on the TV Guide, and on the preview channel.
Also, I thought Sonic (not weekday) moved to USA Action Extreme Team (USA
A.E.T.) last weekend.  At least it did for me.

the pictures on the pogs.  I'm asking this just to see if there are some

        What the?  Hey!  This is a Sonic LIST!  If you guys want to chat,
chat outside the list!  I don't mean to be rude, but you are writing to over
a hundred people!  Next time, be careful where you send your letters.
PLEASE!  By the way, I did not write any of the above stuff and am not

It's been in the new subscriber intro text for some time.  Check the list 
archives under the Subject: Welcome to sonic and sonic-digest.  I post 
this document to the list after each update.

You can get the new subscriber intro text at any time by sending a 
message to majordomo@lists.mv.net.  Put these lines in the text area:
  info sonic
  end
Leave the Subject: line blank because majordomo will ignore it.

Unfortunately, you're gonna have to post the location for the chat again, and
I also need to know.... what do I need to download to access the Chat? IRC or
something like that?
Also... the question that I've been asking 4 ever... does anyone remember
that really old Sonic story that came out years ago (before the Archie comic)
that stated Sonic had a real name? And don't think that I don't know what I'm
talking about, 'cause I used to know it myself. This question's REAL
important if anyone can answer it. I don't think it was an official story,
though.....

Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

Yesterday I actually sent my short stories to this mailing list , and
apparently got the address wrong . Anyway , today I read that stuff about not
posting fan fic to the list , so I guess that's out of the question . (
Apologies to whomever recieved those rather lengthy documents) .

Anyway , seeing that the Sonic web page ( http://rat.org/sonic/) isn't going
to be updated till around May , I thought I'd just "advertise" for my stories
here instead , so that those who think they (the stories) sound ok can
e-mail me , and I'll send a copy to those interested . I just wrote them a
while back , and I'm new to this whole thing . 

Read the stuff below , and if any of the stories catch your interest and if you
don't want to wait till May to get them , e-mail me at vicl@pacific.net.sg for
a copy , which you will receive within a day or two from the time you contacted
me .


The following work is entirely original , to the best of my knowledge . As I've
said , I only recently started in this stuff , so people might have done this
before without me knowing ...

# 1  :  Temporal Trouble

David Prower ( Tails' cybernetic brother created by fanfic author Shawn Wolski )
is apparently lost during a freak accident , and Rotor has to find him . Sonic
admits his "dislike" for the cyberfox .

Personal Note : I can't really go into detail for this story , since elaborating
further would really spoil it .

# 2  :  Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part One

This story would probably fit in the Alternate Sonic Universes section of the
Sonic web page ( in the category "Bloodlines" is in )

This story revolves around Tails . The two tailed fox is fed up with the way the
Freedom Fighters treat him like a child . That however is about to change .
While on a long walk , comtemplating on that fact , Tails' loses his way , is
confronted and nearly killed by a wild animal , but is saved just in time by a
mysterious creature , who upon finding out who Tails is , leads him to meet
a person Tails never thought still existed . That person leaves Tails a legacy
the fox had never even dreamt of ....
Now with a devastating power backing Tails , the fox loses control of himself
temporarily , due to unforseen circumstances . During that time , Tails creates
big problems for Snively , who is now intent on catching and killing Tails ....

This is just a short description which does not cover all the parts of the 
story . 

# 3  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Two

This part of the story covers part of Tails' attempt at mastering his "gift" ,
with aid from unexpected sources . 

This part is rather short , so I can't go into detail 

# 4  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Three

This concludes the "Of Foxes and Sorcery" story . Snively goes into full swing
to capture Tails , causing dire side effects in the process . Though his 
original plan fails , circumstances created by the failure leaves room for a
secondary plan for Snively to capture the menace . Tails is eventually lured
to Robotropolis , due to circumstances beyond his control ... lured to the
trap that Snively has prepared for him .

This story had several references to violence ( not that much ) , and may not
agree with everyone . In my opinion , the story might also be considered 
slightly depressing .... but you decide for yourself .

# 5  : As the Wheel Turns

This story is set in the future , ten years after Snively's defeat . Mobius
is once again peaceful , but an important decision that its rulers have to make
might just have dire consequences ....

Like "Temporal Trouble" , I cannot reveal too much about this story . It is
however , in my opinion , quite an ok one ....

So , e-mail me if the stories interest you . The longest is Of Foxes and
Sorcery Part III ( about 8 pages ) , the shortest is Part II of the same story
( 2 pages ) .

Happy reading !

    I stand corrected.  Indeed, I grovel at your feet in anguish and
shame for my egregious breach of knowledge.  I am a worm, a taod, mere
filth before your shining glory.
    In other words, sorry.  Pity about the rules change, but now I

What do you mean, 'you can't get them anymore?'

I just saw and got my first set of these pogs just last week... they're
still avilable in good quantity, from what I saw.

OK, in the spirit of Aaron's post, let me weigh in with the following:

[submitted for posting]
Space Case
There's been a major development in Robotropolis, one the Freedom
Fighters didn't anticipate.  A young stranger also comes into their
midst.  Are the two related?

[in development]
When A Bunnie Meet A Bunnie
For all those who ever wondered (like myself) whether Bunnie's
counterpart on the homeworld of the Antisonic [Sonic comics #24] is also
partially roboticized, here's your answer.  Bunnie is pulled into the
alternative world and finds herself at the center of a diabolical
plot...one which WASN'T hatched by Robotnik.  Who is the evil genius?
And what about Snively and Nicole?

[in development]
My Quills Are Quick
An "Other Sonic" satire: it's San Francisco, 1944, and who's that short
guy in the trenchcoat?  It's Sonic Spade, private eye and hardboiled
hedgehog.  It's Mickey Spillane meets Mobius in the City By The Bay.

[in development]
Mobius Apocalypse
Tired of reading Sonic fanfic?  Want it to be over with?  Hoping for
some kind of happy ending?  I can't speak about the ending, but along
the way to tying up all the loose ends the residents of Knothole
confront not only death but fates worse than death.  This is going to be
one dark ride.

Watch this cyberspace.

To anyone interested (or still in the dark):

I have created a new page on my sonic page that has screen grabs from the 
Sonic Anime.  This is primarily for anyone who has yet to see any shots 
from it.  The screen grabs were scanned from a certain videogame 
magazine.  I myself have yet to obtain the two episodes. But when I do, I 
will add stuff to the new page.  :)

I know this list is not for game news but this might put a new twist on
things.

The newest issue of GamePro (in their news section... I forget what page)
mentioned that Sega is working on a NEW Sonic game for
  Genesis, Saturn, Game Gear, Pico, P.C. platforms.

All they say about it is that it will feature a new 'gal' named Tiara
(species not given).  It will also feature a new nemesis.  GamePro didn't 
know the name of the new nemesis or the name of the new game.

If this game becomes popular, then we could see a renewed interest in Sonic
in general.  It is probably too much to ask, but it would be great if this
also prompted a third season of Sonic.  I wonder if this will affect the 
Archie comic story.  Ken Penders said that Archie already had plots for
issues up to 50 (or was it 60).  Some of those might have to be tweaked
in order to incorporate the new game's characters (OR Archie will probably
just start out with one of their 48-page specials).

In unrelated news:

I got a box of Cookie Crisp with the Sonic POGs.  Bleh... why do they have
to put those POGs in such an awful cereal.

If you're referring to food, SPAM is wonderful.  (There, now Hormel won't

But net.spam is what we don't need any more of.  If for some reason, you 
do enjoy it, try hanging out in the alt.sex.* groups and you'll find

Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

I dont know if any one cares but I came across an Interview with Yuji Naka
(creater of sonic/robotnik) .  Note this interview took place just before the
relase of sonic 2.

Interview with Yuji Naka: the creator of sonic the Hedgehog

     We recently had the opportunity to vist with Yuji Naka, the creator of
Sonic the Hedgehog, at the SEGA Technical Institute in Palo Alto,
Calfifornia.  Naka and the original Sonic team are currently working on sonic
the hedgehog 2, the exciting sequel planned for relase later this year.
     The combination of Japanese programmers and artists with local resources
make the development of sonic 2 a truly exciting American-Japanese joint
effort.


SEGA VISSONS:  We understand youre busy working on sonic the hedgehog 2.
 What can you can you tell us about it?

NAKA: For one thing, sonic 2 is twice as long as sonic 1.  For another, sonic
has to run through more levels...many more then sonic 1.  Also, the new
Mobius worlds are brighter, crisper, and much more detailed.  However, we
think players will be too busy getting through the game to spend any time
enjoying the scenery.  Especially since sonic will have a new friend.

SV: A new friend?

NAKA: A fox with two tails.  We call him tails naturally.  He helps sonic out
of tight spots, and can help sonic defeat enemies.

SV: How many people are working on sonic 2?  How does this compare with the
oreiginal sonic 1?

NAKA: A total of 12 people are working on sonic 2.  Thats 30% more then
worked on the original game.  Its basically the same team as the original,
with another programer and more designers and artists.  The original team had
3 artists, 2 game designers and 3 sound and music guys.

SV: Who is writting the music?

NAKA: The bass player for the famous Japanese band called Dream Come True
wrote the original music for the game.  The other 2 guys worked on the sound
effects and on converting to a video game format.  The same guys are working
on the music for sonic 2.

SV: What were some of the things you thought about when you first created the
sonic character?

NAKA: At first we used a character that looked like a rabbit with ears that
could extend and pick up objects.  As the game got faster and faster, we
needed to come up with a special characteristic to give our character some
power over his enemies.  I rembered a character I had thought about years ago
who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies.  Hedgehogs can roll
themselfs into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.

SV: How about the name sonic?

NAKA: Because our new character could move really fast on the screen we were
looking for a name that suggested speed.  One of the designers said
supersonic and the sonic part stuck.

SV: Where did the other characters in the game come from?

NAKA: We wanted one of the characters in the game to be eggshaped, so we
created Robotnik.  It was a great character, but since it couldnt be the main
character, we made him the bad guy.

SV: What were some of your other games?

NAKA: Ghouls & Ghosts, Phantasy Star I and II and Super Thunder Bolt for the
Genesis.  For the Master System I did Phanstsy Star I, Space Harrier, Outrun,
Blackbelt, Spy Vs Spy, F16 Fighting Falcon, and Great Baseball.

SV: How and when did you get started creating video games?

NAKA: I joined SEGA in 1984, after I finished school.

SV: Were you programming games in school?

NAKA: I had a part time job  programming games while I was in school.  I
worked on Fujitsu and Sharp computers.  I joined Sega in Japan and then came
to America last year.

SV: What is your ongoing philosophy about creating video games?

NAKA: I want to make interesting games.  I want to show my dreams and visions
to kids.  But most important, I want to create something that will make the
player happy.  I want the player to be surprised and have fun.

SV: Do you have any advice for people who want to creat video games?

NAKA: Yes.  Play lots of games.  Not just play them to win, but think about
them critically and analyze their strengths and weaknesses, constantly
looking for ways to improve them.  They should also draw on their own
experciences for insperation.  Everything I do in my daily life, I think
about how it would fit into a game.


     During our vist to the SEGA Technical Instittute, we confirmed what we
had suspected all along--sonic 2 is going to be the hottest title of the
year.  Period.  Heres why:
     Sonic 2 is bigger, faster, more challenging, and more fun then the
original.  It has more levels, with a secret zone that you'll have to work
hard to find, a new bonus rounds that youll have to get through to get the
Chaos Emeralds.
     Sonic 2 will be coming out on Genesis, Game Gear, and Seag CD.  The
increased capacity of the Sega CD version will allow addational zones, as
well as special bonus rounds between zones.  In these bonus rounds, sonic
takes you on a first person roller coster ride, a half pipe maze complete
with enemies, traps and dead ends.  You control sonic as he tries to get
through the maze, and you go with him as he takes on those 360 degree loops
and 90 degree turns.
     And thats just between the zones.  All versions of sonic 2 will have new
zones, with new tricks, new enemies, and new challenges.  Wait till you try
the new Green Hill Zone, or the new Metropolis Zone, or the Chemical Factory.
 Or Death Egg, where you get to visit Robotniks ship.

The Hill Top Zone will take sonic to new heights.

The Chemical Factory Zone is the acid test of sonics prowess.

The New Green Hill Zone is even bigger and more challenging then the
original.

The Green Hill Zone has sonic and his friend running through corkscrews and
other strange structures.



Well hope you enjoyed.

Several days back , I posted an "advertisement" on this list for my fan-fiction
stories . This is just a small update . 

This is the number of requests I have recieved to date :

Temporal Trouble : 5
Of Foxes and Sorcery (3 parts) : 6
As the Wheel Turns : 5

For those who prefer to download it from the WWW , read here , then skip the
section on e-mails .
A day or two ago , I recieved an offer from the person known as Commander
Sonic Data ( I don't know his/her real name) . He/She offered to upload my
fan-fic to his/her webpage , so that people wouldn't have to contact me directly
for these stories (since rat.org won't be updated real soon...) . Anyway ,
he/she has kept his/her word and all five of my fan-fic stories are now
available at the Freedom Fighters Command Central (I think that's the name..)
The URL is HTTP://INET.UNI-C.DK/~SONICCSD/ . Look in the Gallery section .
Many , many thanks to Commander Sonic Data for the offer .

REMEMBER to let me know what you think of my fan-fic . Thanx .

For those of you who want to recieve the fan-fic via e-mail , read below .
Since I have to send the stories to you manually , and I only check my mail
once a day , all requests should be processed within 36 hours from the time you
sent the request . If this time has elasped and you still haven't recieved it , 
it probably means that the request got lost (Check the address you sent it to ,
was it vicl@pacific.net.sg ? ) , or something equally nasty . So , if you
haven't heard back from me , do send another letter my way , and I'll send you
your request . 

If you have no idea what I'm talking about , chances are that you missed my
earlier post , so for those in the dark , there's a description of my fan-fic
below . Enjoy .

Read the stuff below , and if any of the stories catch your interest and if you
don't want to wait till May to get them , e-mail me at vicl@pacific.net.sg for
a copy , which you will receive within a day or two from the time you contacted
me .


The following work is entirely original , to the best of my knowledge . As I've
said , I only recently started in this stuff , so people might have done this
before without me knowing ...

# 1  :  Temporal Trouble

David Prower ( Tails' cybernetic brother created by fanfic author Shawn Wolski )
is apparently lost during a freak accident , and Rotor has to find him . Sonic
admits his "dislike" for the cyberfox .

Personal Note : I can't really go into detail for this story , since elaborating
further would really spoil it .

# 2  :  Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part One

This story would probably fit in the Alternate Sonic Universes section of the
Sonic web page ( in the category "Bloodlines" is in )

This story revolves around Tails . The two tailed fox is fed up with the way the
Freedom Fighters treat him like a child . That however is about to change .
While on a long walk , comtemplating on that fact , Tails' loses his way , is
confronted and nearly killed by a wild animal , but is saved just in time by a
mysterious creature , who upon finding out who Tails is , leads him to meet
a person Tails never thought still existed . That person leaves Tails a legacy
the fox had never even dreamt of ....
Now with a devastating power backing Tails , the fox loses control of himself
temporarily , due to unforseen circumstances . During that time , Tails creates
big problems for Snively , who is now intent on catching and killing Tails ....

This is just a short description which does not cover all the parts of the 
story . 

# 3  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Two

This part of the story covers part of Tails' attempt at mastering his "gift" ,
with aid from unexpected sources . 

This part is rather short , so I can't go into detail 

# 4  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Three

This concludes the "Of Foxes and Sorcery" story . Snively goes into full swing
to capture Tails , causing dire side effects in the process . Though his 
original plan fails , circumstances created by the failure leaves room for a
secondary plan for Snively to capture the menace . Tails is eventually lured
to Robotropolis , due to circumstances beyond his control ... lured to the
trap that Snively has prepared for him .

This story had several references to violence ( not that much ) , and may not
agree with everyone . In my opinion , the story might also be considered 
slightly depressing .... but you decide for yourself .

# 5  : As the Wheel Turns

This story is set in the future , ten years after Snively's defeat . Mobius
is once again peaceful , but an important decision that its rulers have to make
might just have dire consequences ....

Like "Temporal Trouble" , I cannot reveal too much about this story . It is
however , in my opinion , quite an ok one ....

So , e-mail me if the stories interest you . The longest is Of Foxes and
Sorcery Part III ( about 8 pages ) , the shortest is Part II of the same story
( 2 pages ) .

Happy reading !

Could possibly be a reference to Sally.  After all, a "tiara" is a
"jeweled, ornamented coronet worn by women."  So why not use an article
of clothing as the name.  Especially since Robotnik's name in Japan is
Eggman -- relating to his shape.  I certainly wouldn't mind seeing her
as part of a game.

BTW: when you rely on an aspect of something to describe it in whole
(Sally as "Tiara," Robotnik as Eggman) these are examples of SYNECDOCHE
(pronounced: sin-NECK-doe-key).  This list is now officially

Since I haven't heard of any kind of detente between Sega and DiC, we
must assume there is still bad blood between them.  As for Archie,
remember how long it took for them to get the color of Sally's fur
right!  They apparently have a lengthy lead-time in the comix biz, so
even immediate changes may take a while to show up in print.  After all,
Ken Penders was speaking of Scott Fulop's editorial post in the past
tense for some time before his moving on was announced in #35.

Best advice: save the pogs, throw away the cereal and eat the box.  It's
probably more nutritious.

Kiken here, well, Naka Yuji-san (or "YU2" as he likes to be called) did 
create Sonic, but he didn't create Eggman.  I believe that Ohshima 
Naoto-san (or "Big Island" as he likes to go by) created Eggman.

Jeez, talk about the "long and short" of it.  There were over 200 
original illustrations by the programmers and artists at Sega Enterprises 
(Japan).  After about one month, they managed to narrow the selection 
down to four individual characters:

A wolf wearing a stars and stripes t-shirt (he looked very Sonic-esque)
A bullbog wearing a "cowboy" outfit
A roundish, egg-shaped human wearing loud hawaiian style clothes and 
   carrying an airboard
And well, guess!

Its kinda obvious who made it in the final decision, but its interesting 
to see how Eggman was originally intended to be the hero.  I still think 
that would have been odd, running around the screen with some large, round 
guy.

Oh, that secret zone.  Formerly called "Hidden Palace".  Damn, they hid 
it so well it wasn't even in the final program.

KIken here, nawww, Eggman still has greater tonage, but I'm reffering to 
running through such things as loop de loops and corkscrews.  I haven't 
ever seen Mario do anything like that.  ;)

I think rather they would have slowed it down a bit for Eggman as the
hero..but it would make an interesting spin attack..

MINDLESS BLATHER: I'd be intersting if they'd revive Sonic's 1 &2 (at least)
as 'Director's Cuts', with the hidden palace intact, and the option to play
as Eggman(da hero)(or heck, the wolf would be kewl..I could see him with
Sally..)

     *sigh* Okay, folks, we have a problem here. Specifically, in David 
Gonterman's Sailor Moon: American Kitsune fanfic, part 6, David's Side.
     Ordinarily, I'd just e-mail to him about it, but considering the 
nature of the problem, I felt it would be best to e-mail to him, as well as
post to the mailing list as well as the Sonic and Sailor Moon 
newsgroups--the last due to it being a Sailor Moon fanfic, and the two 
former because Mr. Gonterman is well-known for his Sonic stories...also, 
as a comment about what *not* to do when trying to write a good fanfic...
  
     Very simply, Mr. Gonterman used that story as a platform to bash the 
people campaigning against the CDA (Which is the *Communications* Decency 
Act, BTW, not *Computer* as your story erroneously states) as well as the 
Blue Ribbon Campaign in particular, which is fighting for freedom of 
speech on the net. Judging from what was written, Mr. Gonterman has 
apparently done little or no research into the subject. But, at this 
point, that is irrelevant--I'd prefer to discuss the pros and cons of the 
CDA with him in a private forum.
     What *is* the problem, however, is using what up until then was a 
decent, if somewhat sub-par writing-wise, story as a soapbox to bash a 
group that you politically disagree with. Bashing people you know, like 
that group of AOLers that you had argued with, is tolerable, but bashing 
an entire group you've had no contact with at all is something else.
     A simple, polite suggestion to you, Mr. Gonterman...please edit that 
story to get rid of the political references, or at the very least, mark 
it on your site as politically-oriented as you did the other story that 
put forth your views on the CDA and as you keep refering to it, 'smut' on 
the net. Also, please at least take the time to look up the ACLU site, 
and read the information on just what the CDA is doing, as compared to 
what the media claims it was supposed to do.
     
     Along with the above, I give a caution to anyone else who might be 
thinking of including politics in their fanfics...please don't. 
Otherwise, the flames will probably become fast and furious. And there a 
lot of people with lower tolerance threshholds than me.
  
 
   Now that I've gotten the above out of the way, its my turn to get on 
the soapbox, and point out something the pro-CDA people may have 
overlooked--something that hits *very* close to home to both fandoms 
represented here.
   
 
Fred (StH and Sailor Moon fan): It's time to watch Sailor Moon!
     (changes the channel..watches a bit)
Fred: Waugh! Barney?!? What happened to Sailor Moon???

Me (looking over Fred's shoulder): Didn't you know? DIC was given a court 
order to re-edit Sailor Moon, or face prosecution under the CDA due to 
the 'indecent' scenes involving nudity. DIC couldn't afford the edit, so 
they just pulled the show entirely.

Fred: *sigh* Oh well. Okay, let's turn over to USA--Sonic the Hedgehog 
should be on--at this point, I'd even choke down the weekday episodes.
      (click)
Fred: AIEEEEE! More Barney! What happened???

Me: Oh, Sonic got pulled too--seems people started complaining about 
Sonic promoting terrorist activities, and such. The final killer, though, 
was another CDA violation--most of the characters were nude, or near 
enough to it to be indecent. I hear that Tom & Jerry Kids is next on the 
chopping block.
 
Fred: But Barney never wears clothes...

Me: True, but he has an 'educational show', which Sonic and Sailor Moon 
aren't. So he stays, and the others get tossed.
 
Fred: *whimper*




    Think about it, folks...

<Physics stuff snipped>
Main points:

1) Someone riding on Sonic's back COULD move above light-speed, provided one can do 
that without becoming energy and that rider was shielded from the wind.

2) Assuming Sonic accelerates to mach one (300m/s) in ten seconds, the rider would be 
subjected to 30m/s^2 (or three EARTH gees)

3) Assuming Sonic would deaccelerate from mach one to zero in three 	      
seconds(!), the rider would be subjected to -100m/s^2 (or ten EARTH gees)


My responses:

1) This would also depend on Sonic.  Not only would Sonic have to be    shielded from 
the wind, but he would have to expend the infinite energy required to move at light 
speed.  If he was able to use an    organically-generated subspace warp field (like in 
Star Trek), he might be able to do this, but:

-Air resistence is still a factor

-I have a hard time believing that Sonic could generate a subspace warp field without 
equipment

-Unless Sonic wanted to make himself pass out from too many gravities, he would have to 
accelerate slowly (even at 1000m/s^2, or 100 gees, it would take Sonic 3000 seconds to 
reach 300,000 m/s^2 (light speed))

-I think that even Sonic would have a hard time controlling his movements at higher 
speeds


2) I think that Airforce pilots are subjected to three gees and usually don't pass out. 
Even so, it would be hard to hold on AND not black-out.  However, a rider would 
probably have some advantatges:

-From what I can tell, most furries are one-half to three-fourths the heights of most 
Humans.  This would lower their weight substantially, giving the rider less weight to 
carry during acceleration.  I believe that the muscle-to-weight ratio would not 
decreace as much.

-Most of the Knothole Freedom Fighters are probably pretty dang strong, even for their 
ages.  Besides, a rider would only have to hold on for 10 seconds.

-The reason that people black out at high gravities is because not enough blood is 
getting to their brain.  I think that smaller animals have an advantage (shorter 
distances for the blood to travel) and that furries may have different anatomies.

-Sure, Sonic can accelerate quickly WITHOUT a rider, but he might accelerate slower 
with twice his own weight.  But then again, I don't have the cartoons (sniff), so I 
haven't seen him accelerate/deaccelerate much.


3) TEN GEES?!  Um, the above arguments may give a passenger some leeway, but TEN GEES?! 
Well, Sonic would DEFINITELY have a hard time deaccelerating quickly here, so he may 
actually start slowing several minutes before the stop.  A rider would probably 
black-out quickly here, but if it was quickly enough, they might keep conciousness (or 
just die, like falling off a building).  One thing that would definitely help is if a 
gravity on Mobius is different from one of Earth's (but I doubt that).

Although it isn't finished yet, I am currently working VERY hard on this
story (which will most definitely be listed under other stuff)...

History Repeats Itself
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

Over two-hundred and fifty years after Mobius became a free world, two
"special" twin brothers are assigned to discover why so many people are
disappearing. But when they finally find out what the cause is, they get in
over their heads.

This story also includes pictures developed from Windows 3.1 Paintbrush
Program (bitmaps).

Oh for (insert expletitive) sakes! Nude???? Ware they going to do next? Take
Pinky & the Brain off the air because it promotes world domination? Let me
guess, next they're going to make it a law that all animals on tv -- cartoon
or real, will have to wear pants?????? And terrorist policies? Give me a
break! Us tv viewers will never be safe until someone kicks that purple
brainwashing slob off the air!

It's completed ! The sequel to my story "As the Wheel Turns" . 
It occurs almost immediately after the events in AtWT , with Sally thinking
she's to blame for Mobius going to war again ... and guess who's job it is
to persuade her otherwise ? Meanwhile , Mobotropolis is the target for the
first strike of the forces loyal to Ari and his allies , but the attack comes
from the place they least expect ... it would seem that Ari's forces have 
their own ... connections . 

Read the story . Enjoy .

Having read the comments someone made about Gonterman's fanfic, and
specifically the comments made about his anti-anti-CDA stance
that was contained within it, I am driven to reply to it in a fashion
which I reserve exclusively for such inflammatory prose.

Sir, do you wish to say that you would take away David's right to
free expression, just because it *supports* the limitation of said
right?  Do you not wish to support the total right of every American 
citizen to hold the feelings and thoughts reguarding politics that our
Founding Fathers won in those hard years of the late 1700s?

If you do, use every means at your disposal to force, cajole, coerce, and
pretty much make David remove his political comments from his page.
Also, please stop supporting the anti-CDA movement.  It is obvious
that you don't understand what free speech is to begin with.

Some may ask themselves around now why I would be assisting someone
like David, whose views I do not condone or support.  The reason for
my actions here are as simple as the monitor in front of your face;
free speech, whether I agree with it or not, is something I would
willingly die for.  It is the right of every American: AOLer or
Freenetter, Republican or Democrat, White or Black, or any other
differing groups you can name.  Sure, David's views chafe with mine.
Mine chafe with him.  That's what makes America great!  Not the fact
that we are alike, but the fact that we are DIFFERENT.

In his own way, David is a patriot for having the guts to support an
unpopular opinion in the face of massive (at least, within his peer group)
resistance to it.  He could have easily joined the crowd like some
have done out of sheer instinct, without understanding the implications
or the true meaning of 'free speech'.  However, he followed his own
beliefs (even though I find them to be odd) and did what he thought
was right.  In that respect, I salute him.  However, my opinions of
his are a bit less flattering, but this is neither the time or the
place for such grandstanding.

I leave you with these words to consider.

If you have the BAM page censored, the Bookshire page could be next.
If you have the KKK banned, the EFF could just as easily be next.
If you have the Satanists banned, Jews could be next.
If you have the Republicans banned, Democrats could be next.

The splashing of water against cliffs causes houses to fall into the sea, 
as do small drops of censorship on part of the Constitution of the USA.
Think about that before you tell someone that something should be
removed because it offends you.  Censor one group, and you start you
censor the rest.

Reply to me, not the list.

Joe.

I know you asked for replies to you not the list, but hopefully the 
following will be both relevant and short enough to be OK:

>Having read the comments someone made about Gonterman's fanfic, and
>specifically the comments made about his anti-anti-CDA stance
>that was contained within it, I am driven to reply to it in a fashion
>which I reserve exclusively for such inflammatory prose.

That someone was Chris Forsyth, whom I'll be quoting in a bit...

>Sir, do you wish to say that you would take away David's right to
>free expression, just because it *supports* the limitation of said right?  

I'm sure Chris can speak for himself, but I think you misinterpreted him.
Here's what he said:

>>     What *is* the problem, however, is using what up until then was a 
>>decent, if somewhat sub-par writing-wise, story as a soapbox to bash a 
>>group that you politically disagree with. Bashing people you know, like 
>>that group of AOLers that you had argued with, is tolerable, but bashing 
>>an entire group you've had no contact with at all is something else.
>>     A simple, polite suggestion to you, Mr. Gonterman...please edit that 
>>story to get rid of the political references, or at the very least, mark 
>>it on your site as politically-oriented as you did the other story that 
>>put forth your views on the CDA and as you keep refering to it, 'smut' on 
>>the net. Also, please at least take the time to look up the ACLU site, 
>>and read the information on just what the CDA is doing, as compared to 
>>what the media claims it was supposed to do.
     
>>     Along with the above, I give a caution to anyone else who might be 
>>thinking of including politics in their fanfics...please don't. 
>>Otherwise, the flames will probably become fast and furious. And there a 
>>lot of people with lower tolerance threshholds than me.

Here's my short version of what Chris said:

If you want to send a message, call Western Union.

IMHO, the issue isn't free speech vs. censorship, but rather what's 
appropriate for fan-fic.  Some people like/don't like TTBS/sex stuff in it, 
others like/don't like politics, or religion, or violence.  My feeling is 
that people should be free to write what they want (I'll not get into the 
copyright/trademark aspect of it), but I suggested a while ago that 
somebody (preferably the authors) rate the fan-fic in terms of sex and 
violence so that people like myself who care for neither could skip it.
Apparently this hasn't happened.

You could argue that it's hard to know where to draw the line on these 
ratings; given the preceding two messages, we should at least add politics 
to the ratings, and a previous thread (either started or continued by me) 
implied grimness should be added.  I suppose religion should be added too,
though it's not usually relevant to most fan-fic, at least Sonic stuff...

Just some more rambling,

RDB

Probably not, or else the force of gravity would be much less. Based on the
way we've seen Sonic and all of the other freedom fighters move, the
gravitational field of Mobius is probably pretty much identical to that of
our own. However, it's possible that Mobius has some unique properties to it
that we don't understand. Maybe there's something different about the
gravity of the Mobian sun, as well as its surrounding planets, that could
compensate for a smaller planetary mass in terms of the gravity field.

Well, even though we had less than 10% turnout, the time for "official"
Sonic the Hedgehog chat sessions has been decided through popular vote. The
majority of the votes went to 8PM on Saturdays.

So, official chat sessions will be held every Saturday night from 8PM to
9PM. If you can only come on EFNet to chat once a week, then this is the
time to come. I hope to see many of you there.

Once again, I am on the channel almost every night and you're welcome to
come by anytime. If you have questions about the chat sessions or about IRC
in general, please visit the Sonic chat Home Page at:
http://rat.org/sonic/irc/index.html


Everything that you need to know is there. However, if you're confused about
something or are having problems, please feel free to contact me by E-mail
and I'll do my best to help you. To reiterate one final time, do not send
any questions about chat to the list or to Ratman. Send them to me only.
Thanks everybody! Come and chat with us!

Well, the only reason I said to send it to me was because I fear
the wrath of Ratman.  Otherwise, I'd go ahead and send everything to
the list I damn well pleased.  =)  However, I think replying
directly to the list this time won't bother anyone, either.  If

I might have over-reacted a tad, but I believe that my interpetation

Well, that's a pretty challenging thing to do, considering that
everyone's view of certain factors is different.  It's hard to
find impartial people to do that sort of thing.  (Besides, it's a
pain in the rear to do!  =)

However, in my eyes, the issue is not only `what's appropriate for
fanfic' but also `what's appropriate, period'.  Of course, I have,
of late, bcome rather annoyed with people who SAY they back the
anti-CDA movement, but at the same time try to censor something
THEY don't like.  THAT's what irks me, and THAT is what I responded
to.  The other things just happened to follow along as supporting
elements...man, I must have said those words a thousand times to
a thousand people over the last few months.

Well, to tell the truth `rating' literature has always been
something of a heartburn-inducing thing with me.  I don't like
the idea of a book (or a story) being judged by others to be
"bad" or "good" because of X amount of sex or X amount of politics
in it.  I know that wasn't your intent, but that's how people seem to
judge the ratings in movies sometimes.

But hey, I'm not saying *I'm* right.  I just happen to have a strong
dislike of rating things because of X variable...I believe that the
content of a story, not a property of it, determines its value.
Of course, the film industry's been using it for ages now.  Maybe I'm
just old-fashioned.

Whoops. I apologize. I wasn't specific enough. That's 8PM to 9PM Eastern
Standard Time. If you're in California, it would be 5PM to 6PM Pacific
Standard Time. Sorry about any confusion I may have caused.

    Well, had a short chat with Joe about this on FurryFuzz. (BTW, for 
those of you who play the MU*s, I'm Vulpis Foxfire on FurryMUCK, 
Tapestries, FurryFuzz, and few LP-style MUDS. The Vulpis on SPR, however, 
is *not* me.) He misunderstood my intent in that post, which was *not* 
censorship. It was more a matter of appropriateness of what was put in 
the story, compounded by the fact that as far as I can tell from the 
story, David has little or no knowledge about the Blue Ribbon Campaign. I 
quite agree that David has the freedom to write whatever he wants to. But 
on the other hand, I'd appreciate some sort of warning when he plans to 
go into soapbox mode--something akin to the *flame on* lines some people 
insert into their postings. ;-) 
    Hmph. I *really* need to get my Amiga sorted out the way I want it, 
so I can sit down and write some my own fanfic...though a Meeting of the 
Foxfires seems appropriate--Cyber-redneck meets the Fiery Fox. Yeef. ;-)

Don't fear me anymore. I really don't care anymore. But you'll piss a lot of
people off by writing things off topic, not just me. Did you notice all those
stupid message by RoBUTTnik@aol.com that I let go by?

This is a completely off topic thread. Or maybe you don't care about other
people. People subscribed to this list to talk about Sonic. Think about how
mad you'd be if I started posting "make money fast" and other spam to this
list. Then if you complained, i'd say, "well some people might care about
it!". SAME THING!  Just because YOU want to talk about it, doesn't make it
right to do so.  There have been plenty of times where I wanted to talk about
some things, but refrained from doing it on the list. But I'm not really the
list admin, so if you don't give a damn about other people, go ahead.

Hi ! This is Aaron again .

Just a short note to inform you that "No Peace in Our Time" , my sequel to
"As the Wheel Turns" has just been released , and you can either e-mail me
for a copy at vicl@pacific.net.sg or read it at the Freedom Fighters Command
Central (http://inet.uni-c.dk/~soniccsd/) . Enjoy .

Those of you who have sent requests for my stories or e-mails during the last
48 hours , please hang on . Due to unforseen circumstances , I'll will only
be receiving them tomorrow . Sorry for the delay .

Here's a short description of No Peace .
It occurs almost immediately after the events in AtWT , with Sally thinking
she's to blame for Mobius going to war again ... and guess who's job it is
to persuade her otherwise ? Meanwhile , Mobotropolis is the target for the
first strike of the forces loyal to Ari and his allies , but the attack comes
from the place they least expect ... it would seem that Ari's forces have 
their own ... connections . 

Read it !

I just wanted to say something, so here goes... I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOME OF
YOU SAY THAT YOU TRY TO GET COMICS AND THEN THEY SELL OUT!!! Where I live, no
one even CARRIES Sonic comics, and that TICKS ME OFF!! I have to especially
order it (I don't think Archie knows, or even really cares [heck, maybe they
do] that I'm their main buyer in my COUNTY 'cause I go all over purchasing
about three copies OR MORE of every issue for collector's purposes). 

Speaking of comics.... my science teacher took away my Super Sonic vs. Hyper
Knuckles comic in class. I was done with all of my work, too!! Talk about a
major bummer... and that was the only reading copy that I had!! :-(

Sorry, but you are mistaken.

Sega is planning no such thing.  In fact, this year is Sonic's 5th 
anniversary, and Sega is planning a big bash at the E3 Show in Los Angeles 
during May.

Let me state this again so there is no miscommunication:  SEGA IS NOT 
PLANNING TO DUMP SONIC.  We are featuring him in multiple games across 
multiple platforms this year.  In fact, this could be one of Sonic's biggest 
years ever!  Stay tuned...

I know that they were planning on scaling back projects that involved Sonic,
but dumping him? They're going to get rid of him entirely? What exactly did
they tell you? I'd really like to know what they have in mind. Is this
strictly from a video game standpoint? (If it is, then DON'T post a reply to
the list. You can write to me directly.) I hope this doesn't mean the end of
the comics as well. That would make it a catastrophe!

SOA?Those idiots..
It's not likely..after the powerhouses (Sonic the Fighters, VSonic and that
3rd SOnic one) come into play..there'll be NO doubt that they won't drop him
for much of aything..

Besides, you can't really rely on SOA, they usually don't know much of
what's going on..

I shall never forgive them for Spinball...:P

Really?  This is news to me!  The last time I talked with Sega Reps via
e-mail about a new Sonic game (about 3 or 4 months ago) they couldn't 
confirm or deny anything about a game but said something to the effect of 
"Sonic is an important part of Sega's image.  He'll be sticking around."

One question _I_ have is if this IS true and Sega drops Sonic, will Archie
Comics continue with their Sonic series?  [ Does Archie 'NEED' Sega's 
support or does Archie's Sonic have a 'life of its own' ].

All right, since everyone else is going to advertise their stories, I might
as well too...
These aren't finished yet, but I'm working hard on them.
 
1#  Flamestar's Revenge
      This is really a Knuckles story, but I think it's pretty good...
       Knuckles has been having mysterious dreams lately that all have the
same theme: his old enemy planning revenge.  He dissmisses them at first, but
when a dark secret from his past returns to haunt him, he is forced to face
up to his past and defend his title of Guardian of the Floating Island.

2#  Hearts of Steel
        After the destruction of Dr. Robotnik in the explosion of the
Doomsday Project, the robot known as Mecha-Sonic is freed from Robotnik's
tyranny.  Finding himself lost and alone in a world that hates and fears him,
he finally thinks he has found his place with the Freedom Fighters.  But when
a terrible misunderstanding causes the Freedom Fighters to banish him, he
must prove to them that he really has changed...but will it take a tragedy
for them to see the truth?

I'll let everyone know as soon as these are finished.  ;-)

This is just barely an on-topic post.  You can post a description of what 
the Palace looked like.

And this is not on-topic at all.

You have received a copy of the new subscriber intro text, either as a

personality so far; he/it sure doesn't have one in the comix.  I'll be
interested to see how this turns out.

        Man, that super sucks!  SEGA doesn't know how important Sonic is.
Why don't they dump those Power Morons, instead?!

You are welcome.
Just remember, Sega views Sonic the same way as Disney views Mickey Mouse. 
 Neither are going to fade away.

Wrong again!
Strike 2.  One more and you're out.  :)

Let me see if this can wet your appetite:
Sonic for the Saturn
Sonic for the Genesis
Sonic for Game Gear
Sonic for PC
Sonic for PICO

5 full Sonic titles for 5 platforms.  Hey, and it's Sonic's 5th anniversary! 
 Wow... Imagine that...

Hi ! Aaron again . 
This post is once again to advertise a new fan-fic story I just completed . This
isn't getting boring or tedious , is it ?

Anyway , this one's called "The Persecuted" and it kicks off where "Of Foxes
and Sorcery " left off . 

Here's a brief description :
Tails is settling into his new role as a Guardian quite easily . One eventful
day , an injured creature apparently stumbles upon Knothole , seeking sanctuary.
The creature displays special abilities upon recovery , but the Freedom Fighters
soon discover that this creature has had differences with Angela , Tails' 
enigmatic mentor . The appearance of the creature brings out a dark side in
Angela's personality , which has disastrous( and I mean disastrous ) effects
on the creature , as well as on Tails ... 

As before , e-mail me for a copy at vicl@pacific.net.sg . You will also be
informed if it becomes available at a website .

DO NOT SEND REQUESTS VIA THIS MAILING LIST . CONTACT ME DIRECTLY .

Once again , my apologies to those who have sent requests within the last 48 
hours . Due to circumstances beyond my control , I will not recieve them till
tomorrow , but the minute I do , they will be processed immediately .

Enjoy .

That's a lot of Sonic.  But the *big* question is: how many of those
titles have Tails in them?  (:3

Kiken here, um, which Saturn Sonic game?  There are three on the way. 

V Sonic:  Being programmed by the same members of Sonic Team (Japan) who 
  programmed the Mega CD version, which oddly enough means that Yamaguchi 
  Yasashi-san will probably be in charge (instead of Naka Yuji-san).

Fighting Sonic:  Being programmed by the absolute deity of 3D, Suzuki 
  Yu-san of Sega Enterprises' AM2.  True, the arcade release will be 
  first, but SOJ did announce the home version.

3D Sonic (tentative title):  Programmed by team Sega Tech (SOA).  The 
  same team who prgrammed Sonic Spinball and Sonic 3.    


Well, anyway, make sure that Sonic doesn't get dumped.  I know that Sega 
Enterprises (Japan) have been rumored (hopefully, that's all it is) that 
they will ease Sonic out of the spotlight in the near future.  Chances 
are that VF2 has something to do with that.  After all, there's a 
continuous running anime series based on VF2, while Sonic was only given a 
two part OVA release.  Hmmmmm. 
 

Kiken signing off.

I like the way Sonic appears in Daytona USA, carved into a solid rock face.
It would be neat to find out how that happened, both in real and fictional
terms.

I was looking at a PICO the other day in Toys R Us, and I noticed that
one of the things you can do with "Tails and the Music Maker" is create
animations of your own, using characters supplied by the cartridge.
Naturally, Sonic and Tails are two of the characters you can make run
around on the screen...

Back to eliminate any more rumors about Sonic...


>Kiken here, um, which Saturn Sonic game?  There are three on the way.

Actually, there is one definite.  Sonic Fighters will probably be released 
in Japan (release in the States & Europe is still under debate).

>V Sonic:  Being programmed by the same members of Sonic Team (Japan) who

No word on this one.  Folks around here believe you must be misinformed.

>Fighting Sonic:  Being programmed by the absolute deity of 3D, Suzuki
>  Yu-san of Sega Enterprises' AM2.  True, the arcade release will be
>  first, but SOJ did announce the home version.

SOJ might have announced a home version, but that will be for Japan only. 
 The debate is still going on whether we will bring it to the States or not. 
 It will probably be solved after the E3 Show in mid-May.

By the way, why do you refer to them as Last name First name Mr. (Suzuki 
Yu-san, for example)?  That is an incorrect way to refer to someone.  It's 
like saying "Smith Mr. Joe"

>3D Sonic (tentative title):  Programmed by team Sega Tech (SOA).  The
>  same team who prgrammed Sonic Spinball and Sonic 3.

How wrong you are!  First, it was never referred to as 3D Sonic.  The 
tentative title is Sonic X-treme.  Second, none of the same members who did 
Sonic Spinball or Sonic 3 (two different teams for the most part) are 
working on Sonic X-treme.

Again, Sega letting Sonic fade away would be like Disney letting Mickey 
Mouse fade away.  Not gonna happen.
VF2 is HUGE in Japan, while it is only carries a moderate appeal here. 
 Sonic is big in both Japan and the States.  There's plenty of room for both 
to co-exist peacefully.

Hi ! Just to inform those who have requested for my fan-fics within the last
48 hours that they have been processed . 

In future , please indicate your
name and your e-mail inside the BODY of your text . The reason is that I share
my account with another person , and when he gets my mail , I get the mail on a
disk , and the saved version of the letters only have the text body . I have
had two examples of this already , the first being a person called Zoron , and
the other was just recently , no name nor e-mail . This is the message I 
recieved :

>I'm writing this letter for two reasons:
>First, the stories were great; I read all of them and loved each one.  I
>think you ought to tell more about Tails helping to defeat Snively (hint
>hint).
>Second, could I please have a copy of the sequel to "As the Wheel Turns"?  
>Can't wait to see it!  =)

If this is your message , please resend it , this time with an e-mail and
and name inside the text body . Thanx .

This is the ISSUE that Archie should make a poster for
('listening Paul C.). Pick up issue #36 (out this week) and look
in the Sonic-Grams section, they have a preview of the new Spaz
cover :)

It has Sonic holding onto Uncle Chuck while holding a knocked-out
Sally...

AGAIN - Archie Comics - Please start making STH posters!!!

Thanks -

In a response to a Fanfic and Politics: A Response that Joseph currently
posted...

>I just happen to have a strong dislike of rating things because of X
variable... I believe
>that the content of a story, not a property of it, determines its value.

All I gotta say is that I strongly agree. I live in a neighborhood full of
teenagers, and as soon as they see the "F" word or one similar in a book or a
movie they say "cool!" and parents say "outrageous!". My point is that,
unfortunately, we live in a world of stereotypes, and there isn't much we can
do to change that (I don't want to change the world or anything, I just
wanted to make my point clear). So, before I draw this letter to a close, I'd
like to say this... FACE IT. Although it may be annoying and painful,
simplicity and youth amusement rule supreme, and all others are soon
sacrificed to prove this point.

Speaking of sacrifices... I didn't take the cancellation of the Sonic
Saturday morning show lying down. I complained endlessly, convinced many of
my friends to send letters, and E-Mailed ABC a lot... what did everyone else
do? I'd like to know.

Hey, I think that might be a good idea.  Man, Victor sure gets Sonic comics
early.  I usually don't get them 'till the 10th.

Yes... That would make a good poster.  Many of Spaz's other covers would
make good posters too in fact.

I really liked the way the story is building in this issue.  I'd say more
but I like to give folks a chance to get and read it so I don't spoil too
much.  All I can say is that it has more of a "Sat AM Sonic" feel to it
than most other issues.

Hey everybody!
	I just got Sonic #36 at the comic book shop today, and it's got 
two stories that you would NOT wanna miss!  In any case, there are three 
specific pages to talk about.

	Part One: An ad for the Knuckles mini-series.  Not only does it 
have a nifty triangle info box telling about this (hopefully) epic saga, 
it has a "For all audiences" box, AND at the bottom it has one of those 
things that you'd see for a movie ad(Sceenplay by Ken Penders and Mike 
Kanterovich; Directed by Art Mawhinney; etc.)  The first two things are 
pretty cool 'cause it looks like the Sonic series (and its mini-series) 
is becoming much more serious (serious enough to warrant the "For all 
audiences" disclaimer).  As for the third part, I can't expect a movie 
about this (although it would be way past cool), it sure got my 
attention!  (It's just not fair to toy with my emotions like that!)  Oh 
yeah, theres the bug guy last seen in Chaotix #1 (I think).

	Part Two: The first page of Sonic-Grams.  This had an 
above-average office humor comic AND it hinted at "Mecha Madness" (don't 
you hate it when these guys leave you hanging?!)

	Part Three: The second page of Sonic-Grams.  A certain Kim 
Wessel was asking some questions that were suspiciously like the ones 
that this group has been asking about, like about the Sonic movie 
(answer: I [Sonic] hope so.  It would be way, way past cool).  In 
addition to this, it also has the next cover which shows Uncle Chuck, 
Sonic (of course), and Sally (unconsious, in Sonic's arm).  Is it just 
me, or have the covers shown Sally in some very bad situations (in #28 
she's shown beaten-up, in #29 she's being roboticized, in #31 she's 
being held by Dynamac-3000, in #32 she is holding onto Sonic so she 
doewn't fall down a mountain, and in #37 she's unconsious).

Hi! Aaron again ! I won't take up too much space this time . Just a short note 
to inform you that " The Persecuted " , my continuation of " Of Foxes and
Sorcery " is now available at the Freedom Fighters Command Central Gallery
Section ( http://inet.uni-c.dk/~soniccsd/ )

Here's the description :

Tails is settling into his new role as a Guardian quite easily . One eventful
day , an injured creature apparently stumbles upon Knothole , seeking sanctuary.
The creature displays special abilities upon recovery , but the Freedom Fighters
soon discover that this creature has had differences with Angela , Tails' 
enigmatic mentor . The appearance of the creature brings out a dark side in
Angela's personality , which has disastrous( and I mean disastrous ) effects
on the creature , as well as on Tails ... 

You can also e-mail me for a copy at vicl@pacific.net.sg 

Enjoy .

Sounds pretty cool, Kyle.  I'll ride my bike up to all the local comic book
stores today and check them out.  Hmmmm.  I wonder if I can scan that
preview picture of #37 in Sonic-Grams, enlarge it, and print it out in color.  

Or maybe one of you guys out there can scan all the way cool Sonic covers so
far and post them on your Sonic page.  Hey!  That might be a good idea!

There is another factor that we must all look at... this is the RUMOR 
factor.... there was a time, (some time ago), when Sega DENIED and 
DENIED the exsistence of the then upcoming game Sonic 2 for Genesis.  
HOWEVER, my inside source that that there WAS a sequel planned.... 
well, it turned out that my inside source was correct.  So, as for 
this MOVIE, it could be that Tim & such may not be in it.  Or 
perhaps, as said above, they aren't leads and such.  Such something 
to keep in mind.  BTW-you know what would be cool?  Trent Reznor as 
Robotnik, Bruce Campbell as Sonic (or Rotor...) geez... I could make 
the cast.  And Eddie Vedder as Tails, right?  ;)  Nope... too deep.  
Tails would need like a Bruce Dickenson, (Maiden Fans will understand 
that..) oh well... this is my first post in a while-just been so 
darned busy /w/ life and all.. you know how it is!  

Oh yeah, a BTW for all of you that HAVEN'T been on #sonic (irc)-CHECK 
it out.. :)  It's pretty cool-we've got some nice people there.

Welp, to everyone out there, good night Mobius (and Earth)

I don't plan on missing it, but it probably won't hit the shelves here
in Michigan (or my corner of it) until next week.

You mean there's a chance that the office humor under Fred Mendez has
actually gotten FUNNY?  THIS I gotta see!

They really ought to think about putting in a FAQ File.  ;-)

That's one of the problems where you've only got a few female leads, or
fewer female leads than male leads at any rate.  Not only does this lead
to a very crowded lovelife, you're also limited to the number of damsels
you can put in distress.  I once thought of an idea for a story about
Bunnie with the working title "All She Wants To Do Is Dance."  The plot:
Bunnie develops an uncontrollable urge to cut loose and have fun.  So
she high-tails it over to the Casino Night Zone to whoop it up, with a
reluctant Antoine as her date/chaperone.  I pictured the plot doing a
flip-flop with Antoine being chased by Robotnik and Bunnie coming to the
rescue in grand style: swinging from chandeliers, giving the Rebel Yell,
the whole nine yards.  Too bad I couldn't interest Archie in it; I think
Manak could even have done justice by it.

Hi ! Aaron again . By now you should have gotten used to getting this message .
Anyway , no complaints , I hope ? Here's the latest fan-fic that I've finished :

It's called "Tides of War" , and it continues where "As the Wheel Turns" and
"No Peace in Our Time" left off . This series chronocles the first civil war
on Mobius , ten years after Snively's defeat .

Here's the description :

The tide of the Racial Wars , Mobius's first civil war ,  has turned in
favor of the Alliance of Races , with the capture of a vital member of the
Federated Races government . Unwillingly to let this be known to the public
, the Federated Races cannot call on it's military to rescue the member ,
and it is up to the remaining Council members , mainly all ex-Freedom
Fighters , to save that member . What is even more troubling is the
discovery that all on the Council may not be all that they seem ...

If you want a copy , e-mail me at vicl@pacific.net.sg for one . DO NOT REPLY
TO THIS LIST . Or , this might be up at the Freedom Fighters Command Central
- Gallery Section within a day or two . You can check it at
http://inet.uni-c.dk/~soniccsd/ .

Enjoy .

You can also contact me for any of these fan-fics :
Temporal Trouble
Of Foxes and Sorcery I , II and III
The Persecuted - continuation of "Of Foxes..."
As the Wheel Turns
No Peace in Our Time - continuation of "As the Wheel..."

all written by me as well .

Us? We started bashing our VCR's in. :)


However, one of my friends read Dan Drazen's FAQ and emailed FOX about the
cancellation (you know, MMPR vs. Sonic,Sonic loses).  I think they said
something about them considering buying the rights to the show and making new
eps if they got enough requests.  Wonder if that offer still stands....

This is SO TRUE!!! Archie really needs to make some Sonic posters (I think
the best one to make would be of the S Sonic vs. H Knuckles cover... oh, dare
I imagine....). The ones I have kinda $uck, because I have no idea where you
can get any cool ones, but I know that if Archie started making some posters
then I'd be a heckuva satified and dedicated customer.

Oh, no, I'm not mistaken. You all might think that I don't know what I'm
talking about, but I sure as heck do. I don't know, maybe the Sega
Representative that told me this was lying or didn't have the facts straight,
but he did tell me that in a year or so Sonic may NOT be their mascot
anymore, THEY ARE NOT SURE (I hope they soon become sure that Sonic will
forever be their mascot). The reason why is because they said that they are
thinking of having a new mascot for the Saturn that is a little bit older.
Yes, Sonic is coming out with games for the Saturn, which I truly think rules
and I can't wait to buy them the day they come out, but that does not mean
that he will eternally be their mascot. 

Look, if you're not gonna believe me, fine. But when I called Sega and heard
this dreaded sentence....
"We are thinking of having a slightly older mascot for the 32-bit
generation..."
It just plain shocked the s*** outta me. I

They HAVE to keep Jaleel White as Sonic.  Once you get one guy's voice as 
Sonic, you can't get it off.  Besides...it could be Jaleel's big movie 
break!...

Also, my 2 cents on the Sonic games.  I can't WAIT to get my hands on 
the PC version!

        Sonic IRC is cool, but it would be way cooler if we had more users.
Hey guys you are missing out.  Anyway we hope it is still cool if we don't

This is a _big_ hint... As the 3rd Walker said in "Ring of Truth", "Nothing
is hidden -- only unseen!"  I think it's the closest that the Archie Sonic
Team can come to telling us there's a Sonic Movie on the way, without
actually coming right out and saying so.

I doubt the selection of which Sonic-Grams to print is random, but rather
I expect they are carefully selected to allow the editor to at least raise
various topics with us (the readers), even if he can't give definitive
answers before Sega's announcement dates.

I don't think that is what he meant. I believe he meant, like for

Disney, you think Mickey.

This is Aaron again ! Just a short note before I get into the message proper :
"Tides of War" - my latest fanfic is available at these two websites :
http://inet.uni-c.dk/~soniccsd/ : Freedom Fighters Command Central
http://home.pacific.net.sg/~vicl/ : The Sonic Fan-Fiction Archives

Now for the main topic :
I just completed my Sonic web page . With the rat.org fan fiction section down ,
it would seem that there are very few (if any) sites for fan-fics to be
uploaded . Therefore , I've just turned my webpage into a Sonic Fan Fiction
Archive of sorts . All fan-fics can be sent there from now on . There's also
some other
Sonic stuff , but the majority of the page is devoted to fan-fic . At the
moment , I'm rather short of stories , but I'm counting on all you budding
fanfic authors out there to support me and send your stuff to me . I've also
included
my very own "rating system" for fanfics , which should act as a rough guide
for those interested . Check out the page for details . It's best viewed
with Netscape 2.0 .
Currently featured on the Archive :
Temporal Trouble
Of Foxes and Sorcery I to III
The Persecuted
As the Wheel Turns
No Peace in Our Time
Tides of War
My Brother's Keeper
Evolution of a Predator
Capture the Flag
Other Sonics - The Barbarian 

Enjoy .

Well I received a national college magazine called U. Magazine (May) today
and they had an article about "Star-Studded Students."  Anyway to get to the
point, Jaleel White (voice of Sonic in DIC cartoons) was featured and it
mentioned he went to UCLA, so I loaded up UCLA's student directory and sure
enough he was there. 
  Well a few things:
        1. They give his address and phone number there, but I'm not about
to            call him up and ask him why Sonic was canceled or if there
will be a 
           movie.

        2. It mentions in the article that he is working on a "screenplay
about            basketball from a dramatic standpoint."  Mentions nothing
about            Sonic.

I suppose I could give out his phone number and address, but if I figure if
you want it bad enough you can just look it up yourself at
http:/www.ucla.edu in the student directory. Plus that way I don't feel like
I'm invading his privacy by revealing his location.

when you saw Sally roboticized on the cover, didn't you want to read it

Before I start I gotta say it... love the quote!!

N E wayz, about buying the rights to the show, if anyone ever does Knuckles
should be in the "premiere" episode... that's bound to catch some nifty
ratings. I'd say re-title it Sonic & Knuckles (which would DEFINITELY catch
some ratings), but that'd be a little much, considering that an episode in
which Knuckles doesn't star or appear in wouldn't be thought of as a Sonic &
Knuckles episode.

Then again, they did it with Batman & Robin. :-)

Oh so true. I just got #36 (Date: 22nd of April, you know what year) and the
comic strip is great (but I won't spoil it). Also, the cover of #37 is okay,
but I don't know why everyone is making such a big fuss about it. Until I see
it up close and personal, I don't think it's that hot. Hopefully I'll be
eating my words when that comic is in my hands!

And that "mystery" knight (he he he) shocked me pretty good. Can't wait 'till
next month... oh, and to believe that last year I though things were getting
good! Now they're getting so good that... well... I can't think of a word to
describe it!

Yes, I know that he also meant to make that point clear. But do not forget
that SOA was having second thoughts about releasing Sonic The Fighters in the
US due to it being violent, and involving Sonic.

Back to the point, that is a good idea. Of course I doubt that he would have
the time to do such a thing, but it's worth a shot, and it doesn't hurt to
ask.

If they did get someone else to do Sonic's voice for a movie... who would it

About how Japan portrays Sonic, I agree that their hedgehog is way better
than ours (hypothetically speaking). It's such a shame that, here in the good
'ol US of A, those in high power perfer 'wussy' to 'awesome' (by youth rating
standards). I mean, come on!  People say that someday, the sloppyness and
weakness of the US will be its downfall...

Back to the subject, Sega should let down on Sonic easy. Apparently, Nintendo
will never let down on Mario (look at the game coming packed in with the
N64!!), but that's their problem. It's not anyone else's fault that they have
no imagination.

And about Nights... I've already heard of it. Hey, if it's being done with
one of the creators of Sonic, it already sounds interesting to me.

It says he lives off campus (which makes sense). It doesn't list an email
address for him, though it does for some other students there. I suppose
giving out the snail mail address won't hurt since it was publicized anyway.
Write to:

name: White, Jaleel Ahmad
address: PO BOX 580, AGOURA HILLS, CA 91376

Note: this is listed as his off-campus mailing address. I don't know how
often       he checks this. 

If you do write him, please be tasteful.

Once again , it's me promoting my fan-fics . This time it's a continuation
of the Of Foxes and Sorcery series and it's set immediately after the event in 
"The Persecuted" . You'll find out exactly what relation Tasha the Guardian
is to Bunnie , and some other stuff . Check out the description . It's called 
"Visions of Truth"

Tasha settles into life at Knothole as Tails' new mentor quickly . However ,
several Freedom Fighters start having strange visions in the form of dreams ...
Dreams that may be showing what the future holds for Tails .... and the only
one who has any idea what the dreams mean is Tasha ...

Well , if you find it interesting , you have two options .

E-mail me at vicl@pacific.net.sg for your own copy of the story ...

or 

You can read it at the Sonic Fan-Fiction Archives , which incidentally is
run by me , at http://home.pacific.net.sg/~vicl/

Enjoy !

The article just mentioned Jaleel's role as Steve Urkel on 'Family Matters'.
He mentioned how if a girl askes him to do an Urkel impression or imitates
Urkel by saying "Did I do that?" in a nasal whiney voice, then the date is
over.

I saw an interview with Jaleel and he was asked to do 'Do Urkel' (which he
refused) so I guess he gets pretty sick of it (based on personal
experience).  Back around 1985 I had done some voices for a home movie
featuring plush toys strung up like puppets.  I voiced 'Hubert' (A Hubert
Doll from the Harris Bank), and even though it was seen by only a handful
of friends and family, I had gotten sick of requests to 'do Hubert' rather
quickly. 

I can just see him coming out with a book in the year 2006 titled,
"I am not Urkel" after a few thousand more Urkel impression requests
where he vents his hatred for being typecast as a nerd and tells of his 
other, more serious, acting roles.

I can also see him coming out with another book in the year 2026 titled,
"I am Urkel"... ( alternately titled, "Did I do that?" ) where he lightens
up and gets over the fact that he had been typecast into 'nerd' roles.

Okay... Maybe not.  ... And now for something Sonic related:

I have to wonder if he feels the same about his role as Sonic the
Hedgehog.  I'm guessing he doesn't have as many requests for 'Sonic'
impersonations.  I also have to wonder if he thinks of 'Sonic' as 'just
another job' or if he has a greater regard for Sonic as a character. 

Its wishful thinking but I think it would be great if Jaleel White were 
to join this list even if he only posted about once a month.

About Jaleel getting mad when someone asks him to do impersonations, I
totally understand. When I was younger, I did several puppet play
performances, and had to do two different voices. After hearng a whole bunch
of kids ask me to do the voices a million times, I honestly GOT SICK OF IT!!!

And it would be cool if he joined this list... like it'll happen. (Shoot, if
it does, that'd rule.)

I have uploaded a new Merchandise List, v4.0.0x.

http://rat.org/sonic/merchandise.html

There are several new and revised listings.  I have had to also add a 
number of disclaimers and the like because of receiving e-mail from a 
fair number of people who seem to think the list is a "for sale" list or 
catalog, which it is not.

As always, submissions for unlisted items are welcome.  I also hope that 
someone can clarify the "unknown" item, #99-01.

I wish I knew.  He probably thinks of Sonic as another job, since he has
never mentioned it.  Yes, that would be 'way past cool' if Jaleel did join
this list.  I'm sure he'd get at least 30 letters a day.  Man, that would
take a lond time to answer all of them.  I'm sure he has his reasons.

I know this may be considered as off-topic, but I feel that this is an issue
which warrants a discussion about the rules here.
As many, if not all, of you know, I am currently in the process of writing a
fan-fic called Hearts of Steel.  The story is about Mecha-Sonic being freed
from Robotnik and joining the Freedom Fighters (if you want the full preview,
just check my first post).  Imagine how disappointed and upset I was to find
that someone had written a story using almost the same title and plot; I
announced Hearts of Steel about 2-3 weeks ago, and this story was added
between Monday afternoon and today.  By now I'm sure that some of you are
jumping up and down to tell me that this could just be a coincidence, but I
find that hard to believe.  I will not give the author or title, but I will
say that the title was similar enough that if you replaced one word with the
word "of", and switched the order around, you would get my title.  The plot
was way too similar (almost exactly the same), and the fact that it was just
uploaded makes me very suspicious that this is a minor case of plagiarism
that we're dealing with here, which makes me rather upset and angry. This
makes me very reluctant to share my ideas again, since I always thought that
it was safe to give a short preview of your stories without worrying that
they will be copied.  I thought we had a sort of code of honesty here! I am
writing this as a hope that the author will see this and feel at least a
little guilty for what they did and also to try and help prevent this sort of
thing from happening in the future. =(

P.S. to the author: You're welcome to use my ideas, but I wish that you had
let me know first! =(

It had to happen sooner or later: plot gridlock.

Part of it is in the nature of the players.  If you're going to write
about Mecha-Sonic, there really isn't much you can do with him/it.
Mecha-Sonic can either:

A) continue to harrass the Freedom Fighters
B) join them but eventually be recalled by Robotnik
C) join them

Everything else is a variation on the above themes.

What permits this situation is the fact that Mecha-Sonic is still a
relative unknown.  The character's character (if you follow me) is not
that well defined.  So fanfic writers like us are left to fill in the
blanks.  Do we make him sympathetic (a la Mr. Data) or a nemesis (c.f.
Packbell)?

That's why I almost prefer writing about Sally and the other Knothole
freedom fighters.  There's not as much ambiguity about their characters.
You know what the boundaries are and how they'd react in a given
situation; you also know what would be totally out of character for the
character (which was actually my biggest objection to the portrayals in
the infamous "Tail" story -- the characters just weren't true to
themselves).

As for plot disclosure, it's a fine art.  One should say enough to hook
the curious without saying too much.  It's more a tease than a
summation.  For instance, when discussing the plot of "Capture the Flag"
I let the main point be that the story takes place when most of the
freedom fighters were only ten years old, without going into any detail
as to what happens to them.  I had to walk an even finer tightrope when
discussing "Bloodlines" lest I tip off the plot alltogether.  And when I
go into serious detail, such as my mentioning a piece with the working
title "All She Wants To Do Is Dance" it's a sure sign that I've done all
I can with it and am abandoning work on it, if only for the moment.

Just a few things I learned along the way:

Well, duh. I mean, if I was the voice behind one of the dumbest, most
annoying shows in the word (the weekday morning one, mind you), I wouldn't
tell anyone either.
And the Saturday morning show wasn't on long enough for people to take much
notice ot it... most people hear "Sonic cartoon," and think "stupid kiddie
show that's on every day." It's true, you know.

before (and isn't going to be done by Archie) that has never been done before
is going to be created. Could someone please send me some sort of letter

There isn't any way a SONIC comic in America could be published by anyone
other than Archie. This person may be thinking of the British SONIC Comics,
or Japanese, if there is such an animal. And from what I'm aware of, SONIC is
going to keep coming from the Archie gang under the watchful eye of SEGA.

Besides, when would this book come out? We're already wrapping up projects
that'll be released by the end of the year and soon start working on '97.

lengthy list:

The following are needed:

The age, date of bith, height, eye color, species, names of KNOWN 
relatives, and origions (ie earth, mobius), and current conditions 
(ie Under robotnik's controll?  Robotisized but working for us?  
Where are they currently living?) of the FOLLOWING 
characters:

Dulcy
Sonic 
Rotor
Tails
Bunnie
Sal
Unc. Chuck
Mutski <Sonic's Dog>
Kunckles



FOR all concerned, <g> I'm doing a HUGE profile thingy on my web 
page.  I'm an idiot and probabyl forgot 8,912 characters so E-MAIL me 
YOUR characters and THEIR profiles if you'd like them to appear on 
the (soon to be) officiall profile page.  Blah.  BTW-pictures are 
ALWAYS welcome!  Although I cannot draw worth SQUAT, I'm sure YOU

Hi ! No , this post ISN'T about fan-fics ... but about the fan fiction
archives that I run . The Sonic Fan Fiction Archives , normally at
http://home.pacific.net.sg/~vicl/ is temporarily shut down . The reason is
that I'm currently relocating the Archives to another page . My original plan
was to have it ready by today , but I only found out some error with my account
AFTER I had removed the existing Sonic Archives at .../~vicl/ . So , please
bear with me these few days , and a revamped Sonic Fan Fiction Archives will
open at http://home.pacific.net.sg/~prower/ (I was lucky to get that name
for my account ...) by the 30th of April . I've changed the layout and added
more graphics and icons (ones that work and are displayed this time !)

Later .

I guess her Morgana (Darkwing Duck) voice falls in the last category; as 
did her "Ethereal" voice from Aladdin, and her "Weird Sisters" from 
Gargoyles (the last is three separate characters, and she does manage to 
make them sound slightly different...)

Thanks, Quozl, for the info!

I was wondering, why did the artists start drawing Sonic with the 
"Multi-Quill" format, refer to Sonic #12, compare to #14(I missed #13, 
subscribing ever since)

It was about at this time that the artists were given new modeling sheets on
SONIC from the people at SEGA, featuring a more 3-D look. Simple as that.

OK, you've given me answers, now I give you a page.  I've been working 
(patiently) on this very page all day, so bask in the glory!  I will 
(should) have it completed VERY SOON.  Do you folks have characters you'd 
like to see on the page?  I told you what to send me if you do, I'll tell 
you again:

Name (FULL name, & nick names if any)
age
birthday
realitives & status, (ie- decesased, whereabouts unknown, etc.)
Abilites (ie. tails can fly)
background (this is where you tell of your character... )
picture of character.  


I can <sigh> put your character's profile page up 
WITHOUT a picture, but they look so much better WITH pictures, ya know? 
:)  Well, anyhow, please me, send me a pic or two.


pretty easy?  


Good!  :P  Guys, this page will be sweet if we MAKE it sweet!  Any 
characters, (heck, I'm even gonna put up Nicole's stats) are cool. 

Here's what I've got done so far:

Dutch Bunny
Annie Coon
Kita Tiger
Mighty Fox <heh heh>
Miles "Tails" Prower

Here's what I hope to finish today:

Sal
Bunny 
Antoine
Dulcy
Nicole
Sonic
Chuck?
Muttski??

we'll see...
all is good.
I'll even do the bad guys, too, but it'll take a while, YEESH!  :)

welp, later folks!

Oh yeah... you probably want a page for all this, right?  Well... TOUGH!  
Not yet at least. :)  Later when I have more.  More submissions.  More 
power.  More spam.  Oh well.  Later all!

Try asking for something simple, like the moon!  It doesn't help that
the information that IS available gets garbled; thus, while "Drood
Henge" is the source for info that Sonic and Sally are 16, the people at
Archie Comics insist that they're 15!  Unless someone at SOA wants to
cut loose with a "bible" of the characters. the best any of us can
supply is an educated guess.  

But since when has that stopped any of us <g>?

   anything else.

> Rotor

   DOB: N/A
   Height: approx. 4'
   Eyes: blue
   Species: walrus

   living though under Robotnik's psychic control.
   Origin: N/A

> Tails; alial Miles Prower
   Age: 10 (Archie insisted that he was 4-1/2 but seems to have accepted

   the previous year.
   Height: approx. 3'
   Eyes: black

   Eyes: blue
   Species: rabbit
   Relatives: N/A
   Origin: N/A
   Condition: partially roboticized by Robotnik before being rescued;
   the process left her with a biomechanical left arm and legs (c.f.:
   "Rabbit Deployment" in the comics and Teitelbaum's _StH: Robotnik's
   Revenge_ for varying accounts of Bunnie's origin.  "Blast to the
   Past" establishes that Bunnie was a childhood friend of Sally.
   Member KFF.

   Age: 16
   DOB: N/A
   Height: approx. 3'

For myself, there's a certain quality difference between her Nicole and
her Sally.  The Ethereal sounded MUCH more like Nicole.  And I couldn't
help but hear her Lillian McGill (Rugrats) voice in the little girl from
"Do The Rat Thing" [Aladdin] who delivered the line about the Magic
Holiday Rat.  

Whatever.

Actually, Muttski was seen in a "Sonic the Hedgehog" episode.  It was the
one where Sonic and Tails traveled to Robotropolis to get some cotter
pins.  Muttski was roboticized in both body and mind.

       Hrm...odd thing about Archie's ages--they maintain that Sally and
Sonic are 15, but in the lead-in story to the Princess Sally miniseries,
we see a panel where her mentor (sorry--I don't have the issues with me 
at the keyboard, and I can't remember the titles or names off the top of 
my head) mentions being at her commencement ball--and that same panel has 
Sally dancing with Sonic. Unless Mobius uses a vastly different system 
than Earth, shouldn't Sally be at least 16 (though I may be getting this 
'commencement ball' confused with something else, I'm going on the 
assumption that its the same thing as a debutante ball or a coming-out 
party)?  All things considered, I'd put Sally and Sonic as being 19, 
maybe very early 20's, Antoine being maybe a bit older, Bunnie and Rotor 
being a couple of years younger than S&S, and Tails being about 13, given 
actions and attitudes. How much time has passed between that ball and 
current day, anyway? For that matter, how long *has* it been since Robo 
took over??

 Altho this applies to fanfic, and *my* character...

 Sonia the Hedgehog is Sonic the Hedgehog's fraternal twin. She would have
been *much* shorter (about Sally's height) if it wasn't from Packbell's
'experiments'. (David Pinstone, you've created the *perfect* Kurgan of
Mobius! Wait'll Brent [Duncan] teams up with Alex [watched 'Highlander the
movie--what could Alex's REAL name be....hmm...;D) Anyway...

 Sonia, in my stories and in David G's, is 18 going on 19. So Sonic might be
that age... or Sonia went thru some time warp! ;)

Just to say, if Sally and Sonic were 19, then Antione would be 22. :-)

Well, if Sonic was 15 when Tails was 10 (remember that superintelligent fruit
thing incident?), then if Sonic is 19 now Tails would be 14.

Well, let's see... going by info provided from the Saturday (now Sunday)
morning show and the video games, I'd have to say that it would've been about
fifteen years... man... doesn't seem like it's been THAT long....

If you take into account the Saturday version of Sonic, in the second 
season, in episodes 4&5 (Blast to the past) Sonic and Sally were, "only 
five-years-old!" when Robotnik took over, or began to take over, and if 
you also remember 3234 was the exact date, in which they were traveling 
back to.

SO...
Who are you gonna' believe?
( Personaly, I think that Sonic writers should post their time line, if 
any, in the next issue, no hostility in that statement at all.)

You don't know when  Sonic's,Tails' and Knuckles' birthdays are?  If you've
read Sonic #36 then you'll know, but here's a hint if you haven't: what are
the exact dates that Sonic 1, 2, and 3 came out (day and month)?

Just a short note informing all interested :

The Sonic Fan Fiction Archives will be up within an hour of this posting . The
URL is http://home.pacific.net.sg/~prower . All problems (like broken
graphics) have been fixed and the whole site has been revamped . If you
detect any new problems , please e-mail me at prower@pacific.net.sg . What
can you expect at this new Sonic site ?
Well...
A Fan Fiction Page (which seems sadly ignored by a lot of Sonic websites )
A "Bookstore" which contains zipped fan-fiction for easier download .
A teeny bit of info on Japanese Sonic stuff
and more....

To "commemorate" this "occasion" (This is a joke) , I am releasing two
fanfics which I spent the last few days writing . Both are continuations of
the "Of Foxes and Sorcery" series and are entitled "Trials" and "Touched by
Darkness" .

Here's a short description .

Trials :
Sonic discovers a hidden cavern by accident , and it contains several
ancient scrolls depicting several times in Mobian and other histories . Upon
closer examination of the scrolls , Tasha suspects that the cavern might be
the dwelling of the Watchers , the race that originally gave the Guardians 
posession of the Emeralds , and even more , could be the resting place of
the Great Emerald , source of the Master and Chaos Emeralds ...

Touched by Darkness :

Several parts of the visions the four Freedom Fighters had in "Visions of
Truth" have occurred . Does this signal the "time" the visions spoke of ? 

These stories and others are available at the Fan Fiction Archive . Or , you
can e-mail me for a copy . PLEASE NOTE THAT THE REQUEST SHOULD BE SENT TO
prower@pacific.net.sg NOT THE PREVIOUS vicl@pacific.net.sg .

Later

I've always had trouble with Julayla's comment about the "commencement".
The only thing I can figure is that Kanterovich & Penders must have
written it without reference to "Blast To The Past" which established
"canonically" that Sonic, Sally et al. were 5 when Robotnik took over in
3224 MA [Mobian Age].  That ep, plus "Drood Henge," are pivotal in
establishing the Mobian timeline.  Archie, unfortunately, has never been
held to be as canonical as the SatAM series, and has had to play
catch-up ever since, even with regard to character modeling.  For the
longest time the Archie Sally was off-color [if you know what I mean]
and apparently based on the Sally that appeared only once, in the
off-model "Heads or Tails" ep from the first season.

Much as I'd want to put the gang toward the shank end of adolescence,
"Drood Henge" leaves it as unambiguous that they're in their mid-teens
and that Tails is a 10-year-old.  As for time, 3224 from 3235 makes it
11 years that Robotnik has been in business.  That makes it more
interesting for Tails, who would have been born within a year of
Robotnik's takeover and thus would never have known what Mobius was like
pre-Robotnik.

 In 'Drood Henge' it mentions Sally is 2 years from 18, so that would her
and Sonic 16.  If they went back to the year 3224 (I think), they were 5 (as
above), then it would be 16 years since Buttnik took over.  But who knows
how long it's been since the beggining of the first season to the end of the
second season.

Just to settle the argument, Sally and Sonic were 13 at the commencement, and
they're currently 15 right now. The story with Julayla was written just
before "Blast to the Past" aired, as we were working from a script because we
needed to establish the character of Rosie. As I recall, the time-line wasn't
too established in the script we were working from, as the war was only going
on for a couple of years. 

We worked out our own timeline as a result, based on SEGA treating the
characters as if they aged at the same rate we do. If we treated them in
terms of how animals really age (so many of their years = one of ours), Sonic
and Sally would've been portrayed as battle-hardened adults by this time. As
further proof of this, when we portrayed Sonic and Sally married in the
future, there were a few comments about how old they should be to get
married.

To go by the timeline that the war started when Sonic and Sally were five
didn't make sense, especially when you factor in their current age. As far as
we were concerned, this was one time when the show got it wrong. However,
because it's TV, most people accept that version as gospel. My attitude is
that it's the games that establish the world of Sonic, with the series,
paperbacks and comics filling in the details, with neither one more valid
than the other. Mike and I tried to be consistent with all versions, but for
various reasons, couldn't always be.

Mike and I constantly disagree over what happens in the world of Sonic, as we
try our best to do the best stories we can. And our approach definitely
differs from the other writers involved in the series. That doesn't mean
they're wrong or bad. They just have a different slant on the characters and
series.

So go ahead, enjoy your take on the world of SONIC. Think of Sonic like some
of the other classic characters, and how many different versions of Batman
and Superman there are. I guess you could chalk it all up to artistic
interpretation.

However, if you ask a question to settle a debate, you're going to get my
interpretation that I work out with the editors at Archie and the licensing
department at SEGA, okay?

Ken:

Sorry that you only have to emerge from Lurkerland when there are these
kinds of discrepancies.  

My own interest in this matter, as you may have guessed, goes beyond
fandom.  I continue to maintain the FAQ File in part because of my
interest in theology.  Seriously, it's one thing to speculate on the
process of how the Old Testament, for instance, came to be canonized;
it's quite another thing to watch the process of canonization unfold in
the present.  THAT's how I consider the state of things in this corner
of Sonic fandom.  

And now, for a few particulars:

Has any other comic you've worked on become this complex?  Back home I
have (courtesy of a friend in New York State) a copy of the character
"bible" for the old Care Bears cartoon series.  it isn't just a single
sheet.  And over on a Disney animation group the similar bible for the
series "Gargoyles" has been described as huge!  Perhaps if Sega had
commissioned a similar bible these conflicts need never have happened.
But that's just 20/20 hindsight talking....

The fans generally seem to agree with the idea of aging at a human rate,
as it were.  And "battle-hardened" is the last term I'd use to describe
the Knothole gang.  Tactically, they prefer harassment and hit-and-run
to all-out assaults.

In Judaism, when there's a gap in the Biblical narrative that begs to be
explained, the process called "midrash" takes over.  Over in this group,
it's called "fanfic."  I wrote "Capture The Flag" to answer a number of
questions that never got satisfactorily answered either in the comics or
on TV:

   Where did Knothole come from?
   How did the kids live there?
   Who else was there with them?
   When did they start their campaign against Robotnik?
   How did the power ring generator get there?

Those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.  The
point is, I didn't have the luxury of thinking "the show got it wrong."
My task as a writer was: "OK, using the information I have, including
the fact that Robotnik took over when the kids were 5 years old, how do
I answer these questions?"  Where the fans have been having trouble has
not been in thinking "the show got it wrong" or Archie got it wrong; the
biggest debates, as you've no doubt seen, have come from open conflicts
of fact (15 v. 16 years old; ground squirrel v. fox, etc.).

Again, I don't think anyone is being overly critical of the comics,
though the degree of fan acceptance of the TV series is so strong that
when rumors of a Sonic movie were flying around here a couple weeks ago
I sensed a strong concensus that the character of Sonic wouldn't be
acceptable unless he were once more voiced by Jaleel White.  And IMHO
you and Mike Kanterovich are the strongest writers that Archie has
working on the series.  The burden of consistency, however, appears to
be resting on nobody's shoulders in particular.  Sega has given some
details about characters (Sonic's character guide is available on a
couple of fan home pages) but it's apparently broad enough to permit some
differences within and between media.  And (to bring it full circle)
that's why I continue to maintain the FAQ File -- to bring a certain
amount of order out of creative chaos.

Hey, I'm a librarian.  It's what I do.

Maybe what we need to do is convene the cyberspace equivalent of the
Council of Jamnia (which fixed the Old Testament canon around AD 90).
There'd be representatives of Sega, Archie (I nominate you and Mike),
and Pat Allee and Ben Hurst would represent the TV series.  The fans
would draw up a list of questions and you and the others would huddle
until they were answered.  Right now, the only alternative is that we
the fans take matters into our own hands and write fanfic.

Bet they never have these kind of problems in Riverdale High!

And now for the mushy sig:

Guys, I'm happy and I'm sad!  

Why am I :)?

A: because I've been getting many characters...which I will put up

Why am I :(?

A: because no one's including pics!  I'll put the characters up, but 
without pictures, it will still look nerdy.  Look to see some sign of 
this magical page by saturday.

Later all!

:)

Dan,

I would compare working on SONIC to be almost as complex as working on STAR
TREK, which I have done for both DC Comics and Malibu. When working on any
TREK-related series, the primary guideline was anything filmed was considered
"official" TREK history. It's only now that some novels or certain projects
contain "official" information considered part of TREK lore. Even so, nothing
printed in comics is deemed official. In fact, Roddenberry supposedly
disavowed the animation series he spearheaded back in the early '70's, even
though it features stories by such TREK luminaries as D.C. Fontana, David
Gerrold and Walter Koenig. Not to mention the voices of the ORIGINAL CAST!!!
As far as I'm aware, even though Gene's ashes are scattered out in space,
Paramount still doesn't acknowledge the animated series.

So if you operate on the premise that the source material is the official
history, it's hit or miss when transferring the characters, stories or series
to other media. By this thinking, whatever material SEGA puts out is
official. Anything else put out by other media, such as the comics or TV
series is official only as long as SEGA deems it so. If there are
discrepancies, and there are many too numerous to go into here, it's not
because anyone wants to deliberately confuse anyone. It's due more to a lack
of any dedicated resources co-ordinating details concerning the world of
SONIC.

Even Mike and I get it wrong ourselves. For instance, in A SENSE OF HISTORY
Part One, we showed a hedgehog pounding a sign into the ground with his
family standing nearby. We originally had on the sign "Future Site of
Knothole Village", as we thought it would be a neat bit to state that
Knothole Village stands where the Floating Island once existed. However, when
we wrote that, Mike Gallagher was only beginning to write the TAILS
mini-series. After he established the world of Downunda and Knuckles'
grandfather Athair, it was decided it made more sense since echidnas come
from Austrailia to have the Floating Island originate from Downunda. Due to a
rush of deadlines at this time, I wasn't even made aware of this until I saw
the printed story.

The only bible I ever worked with in regards to the SONIC comic series was
the one for the ABC Saturday morning series and character model sheets from
SEGA, and that was it. I had to depend on my 8-year-old son Stephen to keep
me in line regarding SONIC as he is a HUGE fan. (A side note here: I got
involved with SONIC because he is my son's FAVORITE character.)

When Mike and I started working on the series, we were submitting stories
based on what Mike Gallagher was doing, as he was the primary writer at the
time. With each passing story, we started getting subversive and began
emphasizing more of the adventure aspects and less of the bad puns, using
humor when called for, and not doing a gag at the expense of the story. If
you go back and reread those early issues, you'll see how we gradually began
to steer the book in the direction we wanted rather than maintaining the
status quo. However, we could not have done this had the folks at SEGA not
been receptive to what we were trying to do.

Of all the ideas we submitted, the original story proposal for the PRINCESS
SALLY mini-series is the one I'm sorry didn't get off the ground, but I think
we more than made up for it with the KNUCKLES mini-series.

"Battle-hardened" describes an attitude, not tactics. If Sonic and Sally and
company had been fighting for over ten years with Robotnik, they'd have the
attitude and look reminiscent of soldiers fighting in the trenches during
World War II. And we'd love to do that, but we can't because of our young
audience. As it is, in order to get anything with an edge through, we use
Disney as our guideline, as in: If Disney can do it in their cartoons, why
can't we in our comics.

As for Sonic's history, Mike and I have a rough timeline and what stories
we'd like to document about that timeline. For instance, if you read SONIC
#36, we mention Robotnik's mentor Kodos, who is going to feature very
prominently in the series after issue #50. In #17, we showed Robotnik taking
over Mobotropolis, and portray Julayla getting Sonic and Sally to safety.
Although we didn't have the room, Rosie was there as well, making sure that
Tails was escorted safely out of the war zone. Antoine and Rotor were at the
front lines, and beat a retreat to fight another day. Tails' parents were
among those roboticized, and we have yet to decide how or if we'll
incorporate them into the series. Y'see, we can answer your questions
regarding continuity, but this is the Archie version APPROVED by SEGA.

I apologize for rambling, but I tried to answer your letter the best way I
could to explain why things are the way they are. This is not meant to
detract from the fan-fic, which for reasons I'm sure you understand, I don't
read and can't comment on. If the fans want to fill in the blanks, that's
what TREK fans have been doing the past 30 years, and there's been no end to
any of the debate regardless.

Here's a form feed, for what good it does:

The cover:

AAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

That rotten UPC symbol covered up part of Sally's cute tush!!!

Note to Spaz et al: please take this into account when creating these 
masterpieces!  I was half-tempted to try drawing the rest of her in from 
the preview in Sonic #35...

Also, I think I kind of liked Sally better with black pupils with a white 
dot on them; this white pupil on a blue iris doesn't quite work for me (if 
anybody wants a sample of the former, I can e-mail sally.jpg to them...)

I didn't quite get the discussion re. "The void" vs. "The zone of silence", 
but maybe I didn't concentrate hard enough (or else I need to check those 
back issues mentioned...)

The bottom of page 8 was a bit confusing; are we to infer that Robotnik 
kept that "photon cannon" going from the time of King Acorn's imprisonment 
until just now?

I'll leave comment on the ID of the masked rider to others, and/or until 
after another issue or two :^)  Though it _does_ conflict with the show...

The Knuckles story:

Not sure why Dimitri had to hook up _sails_ to the island - didn't he have 
enough power to propel it himself?

How could fire ants chew through the wall in so short a time?  (hours?)  
This seemed a bit deus ex machina to me...  Also that with all that power, 
Dimitri could apparently be crushed to death by the collapse of the tower 
(and it wasn't clear that the skull-like (shades of The Phantom?) Mt. Fate 
was created by its collapse).

Well, well, a quote from Proverbs 6:6 :^)  Either this means Mobius is a 
future Earth (refuted by the letter column stating Tails is a Mobain fox 
not an Earth fox), or it was influenced by Earth culture/settlers, or that 
Star Trek episode about parallel planet development (Bread and Circuses) 
applies, but _that_ would have some interesting theological consequences :^)

I still think the decision to dismantle their technological society was a 
bit of an overreaction, but I'll accept it for the story's sake...

The preview of the cover for #38:

I'll leave comments on this to others who can do so without drooling all 
over their keyboards :^)  At least the UPC symbol will only cover part of 
her boots this time...

Keep up the good work!

RDB
