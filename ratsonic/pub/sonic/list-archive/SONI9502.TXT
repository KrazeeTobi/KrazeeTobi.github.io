>From The Desk of Sonic The Hedgehog@huey.csun.edu

HELLO Everybody!  Just thought I'd hop in and introduce myself....  I'm a
way past cool fan of the Sonic The HEdgehog cartoon and comic book.  My
name is Bryant Melesko and I am a student here at California State
University at Northridge.  I am a computer science major, with a strong
interest in computer art and artwork alike.  

To the point...... 

	I have about 40 megs of Sonic Artwork in my archives which is
considered the largest collection anywhere(currently as of 04/02/94) seen.
 If anyone has a larger archieve than I, I'm willing to share my images. 
There's a lot of potential here in this mailing list, so keep it alive! :^)
I think you all are WAY PAST COOL!

Welcome to virtual Knothole!  We don't have very many subscribers yet, so 
if you could, please repost your into about in a week or so.

We may be getting use of a ftp site for images; I'm waiting to hear back
from Ratman on that.  I also told him I'd upload my .WAV files. I just
thought that he may be able to set up for us a Knothole Homepage on the
WWW site as well.

Did either of you watch yesterday morning?  That was the first episode of 
the cartoon I saw.  It was good to come back to it as I now understand 
what was happening much better, and I know that's not really a typical 
episode (we didn't see much of Robotnik or his 'bots).  I still don't 
like their use of a dual title card.  Both this time and last time, I 
didn't realize the first segment was over until a few minutes into the 
second one.  Seperate title cards would have fixed that problem.

It was a change to see Antoine get so hysterical rather than just collapse 
like he usually would do when overanxious.  Too bad the female robot didn't 
make him any more aware of what Sally must feel like when he pursues 
her.  Anyone know what Sonic's chili dog recipe is?(g)

I was looking at the K-Mart ad in today's (Feb 5) paper, and athe bottom-left
of the first page is a picture of StH Valentine cards.

Now this I have got to see.  Most of the time, Sonic doesn't seem to be all
that receptive to forming a relationship with Sally.  And Sally is even less
receptive to Antoine.  It really makes me wonder how the cards' desginers used
the characters.  For 99 cents, it won't hurt me to find out tomorrow.

Anyone interested in a Sonic merchandise list?  I'll submit everything I know
about which I know is not comprehensive.

This was one of 2 episodes which have 2shows in one.  Coincidentally, they
are both about Antoine and they are both very annoying(IMHO).
I wish I knew WHY Antoine keeps becoming more and more of a main character...
he has almost no redeeming qualities!  If he is ever going to become an 
interresting
character in my book, he's going to have to accomplish something useful 
(besides screwing up Freedom Fighter missions)

A change? better watch more of the show before you say that ;)

This last week's show was just fluff.  Nothing happened to expand upon the 
plot, and
was probably used for the sole purpose of filling time. 

Final: I wouldn't mind A show dedicated to expanding on Antoine's character, 
but 4!
         c'mon,  the writers must have better ideas than this...
P.S. - I don't like Antoine very much.  <REALLY?>

That's true.  I hope you eventually get to see "The Doomsday Project", 'cause
the Sonic +  Sally relationship takes an interresting twist...

As long as I'm on the subject, what is the rule about discussing plot points?
I know that almost NO rules are established yet, but I don't want to spoil 
the show
for someone who hasn't seen it yet!  Perhaps a disclaimer at the top would be
best...but that should be decided upon.

I am. please send it out...after it's sent, the individual members will get 
a chance to 
expand upon your list...

His parts are probably the easiest for the writers to write.  Just have 
him do something that's silly at best and throw in a few "sacre blue 
chesses"'s for good measure.  Presto!  You've just written several 
minutes of program time in, well, several minutes.

A change as in this_time!=other_times.  It makes things less 
predictable.  Whether it's a change for the better is another matter.

Filling time could be one reason, or maybe the only reason.  Maybe they 
had to meet some kind of deadline on this show or for another show they 
write for.  How experienced are the writers anyway?  It takes time to 
perfect one's craft and you have to start somewhere.  DIC hasn't been 
around all that long, and it's going to be tough for them to hire away 
writers from Warner Bros., Disney, Hanna-Barbera, etc.

I also wonder about how much direction DIC takes from Sega.  For whatever 
reason, it could be Sega wants Antoine developed but DIC doesn't know how 
to do it right.

It would be way past cool if we could get representatives of Sega and/or 
DIC to subscribe and participate.  But until that happens, all we can do 
is speculate.

I don't want to lay down a lot of rules, especially in the beginning.  
I'm sure others besides myself appreciate your desire to not spoil things 
for others.  The Subject line (like the date) can be used for a brand new 
episode and/or a notice in the message.  Otherwise, as you said, just a 
warning in the message itself.  Let's not get really technical about 
requirements, but what I, personally, do is add a --------- line across

This is one case where I think it is worthwhile to include the games.  
That's what most of the merchandise is.  Once more-or-less complete, the 
list can become a retrievable file just like the FAQ now under 
development.  For (non-game only?) merchandise, I think we should also 
include the manufacturer's address or some other purchasing guide.  I'm 
not so sure about prices.  Pricing is subject to change, local market 
conditions, and foreign exchange rates (we will be getting >=2 non-US 
subscribers)  -- and I don't want anyone to try to hold me to a price.

I've been having trouble mailing to him lately.  My messages to him 
frequently bounce.  I got my list of game codes to him on second 
attempt.  And I've tried three times to tell him that the FAQ can be made 
a file retrievable by list subscribers through the mailing list 
software.  I hope he gets whatever's wrong fixed soon or he will have 
trouble participating in this list.

I have a directory for sonic stuff in my ftp directory.

put stuff in /pub/users/rat/incoming/
and if it doesn't blow, I'll put it in the sonic directory

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS

Welcome to the only mailing list that's way past cool  -- Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In this mailing list, we discuss the comic
book and cartoon based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

To post to the list, send your message to sonic@sard.mv.net.
There will soon be a FAQ for the list.  Once ready, it will be
a file retrievable by subscribers via mail.

This list is archived, and the archive can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as a file (just like the FAQ).  To
get a list of files you can retrieve, send this text to
majordomo@sard.mv.net:
    index sonic
    end
Once you have the filename of the file(s) you want, retrieve them
by sending this text to majordomo@sard.mv.net:
    get sonic file1.txt
    get sonic file2.txt
    end
Use one "get" line for each file you want.

Let's all try to not get bogged down in rules and policies.  You
may post information and opinions related to the characters and
stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  If you feel you must flame someone (other than
Robotnik (g)), please do so in mail directly to that person.  And
as on most areas of the 'net, legally obscene material and posts
of a commercial nature are not welcome here.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

Many thanks to Ratman (Paul Hurley) for giving us a virtual Knothole.

FTP SITE
--------
There is a ftp site to go along with this list.  Just ftp to
ftp.mv.com and go to /pub/users/rat/sonic.  Upload files to
/pub/users/rat/incoming.  Sounds and images are welcome.  Older
archive files may be available here in the future.

Other Internet Resources
------------------------
rec.games.video.sega
    A Usenet group for discussion of Sonic the Hedgehog and other
    games from SEGA.  Use r.g.v.s instead of this mailing list if
    you want to discuss the Sonic games, get codes/cheats, etc.
rec.arts.animation
    A Usenet group for discussion of animated cartoons.  Please
    read that group's FAQ before posting there.
alt.binaries.pictures.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting image files related to cartoons.
    This group is not widely propogated.
alt.toon-pics
    This Usenet group was supposed to be replaced by a.b.p.c but
    some sites continue to carry a.t.p too/instead.
alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting digitized sound files related to
    cartoons.  This group is not widely propogated.
Veronica
    Try looking up the word "hedgehog" and a *few* Sonic files
    should turn up.  Most of what you'll find will not be at all
    related to Sonic.
WWW
    Sega has a home page (http://www.segaoa.com/), but you won't
    find much information there, but have your credit card
    ready (g).

Juice time, outta here!

Sure have... they're everywhere out here.  Alas, they suck rox big time.
They're terribly generic (which I expected), have lousy artwork (which
I was afraid of but hoped wouldn't happen anyway), and have only
three different cards- Sonic and Robuttnik (don't ask), Sonic,
and Tails.  O, for a Bunnie valentine...

Here are the beginnings of a Sonic merchandise list.  Let's try
to make it more complete and in time make it a retrievable file.
Although the Sonic list isn't for games, I think it would make
sense to include them here.  I'm not including the comics in
this list; I think they should get their own list, possibly along
with summaries too.

TAX ALERT:  The plush toys are made in China and may be subject to
the 100% tarriff the President is laying down.  If you want them,
BUY NOW!

GAMES
-----
1. (handheld game) I only remember seeing it about a month ago.
   Can anyone else supply details?
2. (wrist game) This was offered when you bought >=1 video cassette
   and sent back the proofs of purchase.  The offer has already
   expired.  Is it available from other sources?
There are more, so how 'bout it guys?  Maybe some brief descriptions
of all the games too.

TOYS (NON-GAME)
---------------
1. Sonic plush toy.  It's of Sonic, about 12".  Made by Caltoy, a
   division of C&H Toy of America Inc. at La Palma, CA.
2. Tails plush toy.  It's of Tails, also about 12" and from the
   same manufacturer.

FOOD
----
0. I've seen a commercial for Honey Nut Cheerios featuring Sonic and
   its bee mascot.  Watch the General Mills section of your grocer's
   cereal aisle in case there is a Sonic cereal in the future.

CLOTHING
--------
1. Boys' briefs from Fruit of the Loom.  Size 5 (and others?).  I
   didn't buy a pack so I don't have a full description.
Anything in adult sizes (not necessarily underwear)?  And what about
something with Sally for little girls?

CARDS AND COLLECTIBLES
----------------------
1. Valentine's Day cards.  I found them in a K-Mart ad, but I've not
   yet found the cards themselves.  Anyone else?

VIDEOS
------
All listings are VHS cassettes.  Laserdisc availability???
1. Super Sonic (Buena Vista 2850)
   "Super Sonic", "Sonic and Sally"
2. Hooked On Sonics (Buena Vista 2849)
   "Hooked On Sonics", "Warp Sonic"
3. Sonic Racer (Buena Vista 2851)
   "Sonic Racer", "Sonic Boom"

I don't have complete information on the "Adventures of Sonic the
Hedgehog" video series, so I didn't include them.  All the listings
above are Sat-AM shows.

Hello, fellow Mobius Freedom Fighters!

Thank you for the indoctrination to the organization that hopefully
will save the planet from Robotnik.  I'm 20 years old, a student at
UT-Austin, a geology major, and I love just about everyone in the
Sonic shows (excluding Robotnik, Snively, SWATBots, etc.).  I've
seen nearly all of the Sonic shows (that's "Sonic the Hedgehog",
not "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog";  "ASH" is verrry bad (IM
HO)).  I haven't read any of the comics, but I'm aware that there's
at least 2 available:  "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Princess Sally".
I can talk to anyone concerning the shows, and I'll try not to spoil
the ending in advance if you haven't seen it (notify me first).

Chow y'all.  Later!

Shawn Wolski, N5UNA

Need more information about Sonic products?  Sega of America
is selling clothes with Sonic (some include Knuckles as well).
Go to the Sega Web (at:  http://www.segaoa.com), then click on
"Sega Mall".  There you will find Sonic accessories.

Warning:  Access to this address (at least from my location) has
been unstable.  The address IS correct;  Internet has apparently
been misbehaiving all day (2-6-94).  If you can't get to the Sega 
Web, blame it on Internet.

Welcome aboard!  I'm sure the Freedom Fighters on Mobius are glad to be 
finally getting some help from us stuck on Earth.  We'll all see to it 
that Robotnik is defeated once and for all.  When that happens, what 
should happen to Robotnik and Snively (assuming they are not killed in 
action)?  Should we start lobbying for a Marshall Plan for Mobius?

There's a "regular" series, a Sonic mini-series, the forthcoming Sally 
mini-series, and a special "In Your Face" issue (which will be 
followed-up soon).

Issues 1-7 of the "regular" series, the IYF special, and the Sally 
mini-series can all be ordered by mail.  Look for the coupon is Issue #21 
on sale now.

Thanks for posting that.  I have, actually, listed the Sega Web page 
already.  Look in the intro text under "Other Internet Resources".  So 
far, I haven't logged on there and compiled the information.  If anyone 
wants to "beat me to it", go ahead.  I don't think they list anything not 
from Sega themselves there.  I wanted to make sure everyone gets to find 
out about non-Sega products too.

The FAQ is still under development.  Contact: drazen@andrews.edu.

What problems are you having?  Maybe we can help.  For the moment, send

That's pretty lame.
They could have fit him into the story so that he was older, yet isn't
necessarily "looked up to".
Or they could at least not make him look so poorly drawn!!
Oh well, I'm just complaining... I like most everything else about the 
show, except the "filler" episodes that lack plot.

I have a VERY general outline of how we (yes, the people on Earth) can 
help the Mobius Freedom Fighters put an end to Robotnik's plans once
and for all!  Here's the idea:

-Build a time machine.  Go about 4 centuries into the future (after all, we
 are supposed to have warp drive technology by then, right?), and take
 (read:  appropriate) a starship (my bet's on the U.S.S. Enterprise-D).
-Use the starship to travel back in time (it worked on ST [original series]
 and ST 4:  TVH) to the point of time BEFORE Robotnik managed to 
 cause all this trouble.  (It's critical that we get the information on the 
 exact date that the coup occured from Sally or whoever might remem-
 ber WHEN it happened to the day.)
-Travel to Mobius, Warp 9.  Take the appropriate action against Robot-
 nik to stop his evil plans. (NOTE:  Must be dune under ABSOLUTE 
 secrecy, to decrease the involvement of others in the equation.)
-"Leave" information that Robotnik (in that time, Julian) had a fatal 
 accident.  Must also be performed covertly.
-Return to our time period.  Either send back or destroy the starship.
 If send back is desired, data concerning the mission must be dele-
 ted, and the ship be under control by the computer.

Yes, there are a few technicalities in the mission plans.  Wouldn't it
be great if we could do it, though?

We can use some short descriptions of the games for the merchandise 
list.  You can also talk about how things in the games tie in (or don't!) 
with the cartoon.  But for serious game discussion, cheats, etc., please 
use Sega's newsgroups.

My local stations don't carry the "Adventures of" series; the closest 
station that does is 75 miles away.  I can't see if there is any 
significant difference in staff, but there could be.  A weekday series 
needs more shows, and if DIC compromised quality for quantity, it 
wouldn't be the first time such a thing happened.

I thought that was you lurking in the corner, listening intently with 
tape recorder on, while Robotnik and Snively were making their plans this 
morning.  Now we need to have <name??> fly back to Knothole with a note to 
warn the others.

Sonic and Sally did go back in time to do this.  They didn't succeed but 
did save Rosie and got the plans used for the making of the roboticizer.  
It may have been Sonic's lack of concentration that got them into 
trouble, so maybe we would have an advantage.

That will require lots of planning, and some backup plans.  We'll need to 
first send a ship to gather and communicate information, and make sure 
that ship is not discovered.  Does anyone know where Mobius is?  If it 
revolves around Alpha Centauri (the closest star other than our sun), it 
will take four years for radio signals to reach us.  We'll need to plan 
for that somehow.

We'll also need to delete all information about the mission from the 
brains of those who participated so there's no possibility of accidental 
divulsion.  We also need some way to account for those KIA, if any.

Mondo cool!  It's going to take a lot of planning, but you got to start 
somewhere.

I believe the major reasons for the change in appearence were 
1)new season - alot of visual improvements took place, although I wouldn't 
call this
                       an improvement!
2)new voice - the original Rotor voice from the 1st season was replaced - that
                   alone could explain his lack of character development, 
and could                             also be a reason for changing his 
appearence.

Not from where I stand...what kind of lame adventures could you cocieve to 
happen without the coup taking place?  (i.e. Sonic would probably end up
a large tub-o'-lard eating chili dogs since he would be getting no workout 
from Robotnik)
I also don't understand how a small group of "covert" agents from our time 
(humans)
could "fit in" to Mobius' society and kill the head leader of Mobius' armed 
forces!)
Just think about how difficult it would be to go after someone with that 
power...

HOWEVER, I am a true believer in the idea that Mobius is a FUTURE EARTH.
(which could change the plan you suggest)

I had a long discussion about this with a fellow Sonic fan & would LOVE to 
hear any opinions on the subject of Mobius being Earth...
and if you DISSAGREE, I'm prepared to defend my possition...
If you AGREE, welcome to the club...

Let me start by saying:
I hate Sally's new jacket.

It is a true eye sore on that lovely vixen's body!  One which I have long 
podered over.
All I've heard about it so far (in a.f.f & r.a.a) is praise for how great an 
improvement
it is over the 1st season look.  I dissagree.  I think it is the only true 
shortcoming
that the new season offered.

Any comments?

Hi, fellow Sonic fans!

I'd have to agree with Jeff ( jpegnato@vt.edu) about the introduction
of Sally's jacket (or is it a vest) in the 2nd year of showing.  It hardly
even covers her decently (if that is what the producers ultimately
wanted), and she was never nude as in "offensively" nude.  Why 
bother with it?

Another thing that Jeff brought up:  her species.  It's pretty easy to
tell that Sonic is a hedgehog (even the the title says that), Tails is
unmistakably a fox, Bunny is a rabbit, Rotor is a walrus, etc.  Sally
to me has been somewhat of a mistery as to what species she is.
According to Jeff, she's a vixen (?)  I used to think that Sally was more
of the deer persuasion, but after seeing that her father had a tail
(though it didn't seem to fit the general fox tail, but hey, this is the car-
toon universe), I'm not so sure.  If she is a fox, where's her tail?  All
I see is a small stub of fur on her rump.  Does it grow in when she
comes of age (becomes 18 years old), or was there an accident in
the past where the tail was lost?  If we go on the assumption that
she is a fox, that may explain why Tails calls her "Aunt Sally" all the
time, though this could be more the result of a "status nickname",
since Tails lost his family sometime after the coup.  The title could
come from years of Sally taking care of Tails after his family was
lost.  Then again, anything is possible.

Any further input would be appreciated.

	The thing is, the times have changed and the feminism of cartoons
have generally caused the introduction of politically correct clothes on
cartoon characters.  Nobody thought it would be offensive to draw a nude
Sally which wears just boots in the original esposides in the first season
run.  I suppose someone whined and the people immediately revamped Sally's
image.  Who knows, I could ask the people who work behind the scenes at
DIC, as I have access to the Sonic Art Team myself.

	In a issue of Sonic the Hedgehog comic book, the editor replied to
a similar question asked by Jeff and the others -- the answer from the
editor was that Sally is a fox, if I remember correctly.  But I can
backtrack and check on that fact.

	According to the editor of Sonic The Hedgehog comic books, Tails
got his second tail from Antione which explains why Antione has no tail. 
And Tails family was captured by Robotnik during an raid.  Sally was hence
assigned to care for Tails and become Tails' aunt.  This is an theory...
anybody come up with a better theory for Tails' existance with Sally.

I hope no one minds me butting in but here is what I think. It might be that
sallys mother was squral (SP.) But I do know, after seeing sallys father, he IS
a fox and sally looks like a cross between a fox (Her face) and a squral. Now
all that needs to be explaned is what happend to sallys mom, That would help a
lot. Now I have a question. What happend to tails mom and dad and how did he
meet sally and the other freedom fighters. I'm always looking for info on tails
as he's my favorit freedom fighter.

Well, previous poster dilikes Sally's vest.  I like it, and it makes a
practical sense.  In "Sonic -- In your Face!" she makes the simple and
intelligent observation, "I always wanted pockets."  Now, is it fair for
your focusing on her corpus for her to go unpocketed?

    On a variant topic-- How many (probably many) have noticed that in
the comics, Bunnie Rabbot's whole lower torso is roboticised, but in the
show, either it is flesh still or she wears a leortard from false
modesty?  (The latter is unlikely, since all Sally wears is boots and
the aforementioned vest.)  Any ideas on the continuity theories there?
(Maybe she wears chrome trunks in the comic.  Hey, It's been done
before.  Pick up anything from Image. (: )

She still uses her boot for Nicole though...
What does she need to carry?

Nothing really.  In my opinion, at least as far as the cartoon goes, is 
that they gave her a vest because the TV censors were getting nervous.

I read that she's a ground squirrel.  I don't remember which issue that 
was, but it is a recent one and won't take me long to find.

I think that was #16.  They said Antoine gave his tail to Tails so that 
Tails would be able to fly.

Well... I've read similar discussions by animators before, and what
it usually boils down to is 'color interest' in cases like this.
For example, in the original Alladin movie, Genie wore shackles because
he was ensalved to the lamp; yet in the series he still has them.
As the producer put it, without them the character was nothing but
'A big blue blob' and not as interesting visually.

Now, before anyone bonks me for claiming Sally isn't visually
interesting... :) I'm not saying she isn't.  However, I personally
feel she *does* look better in the jacket; IMHO she's gotten the best
new character design this season by a substantial margin.  This is
partly just a personal fetish of mine; I always get so tickled when
a toon is shown wearing (gasp!) a *different set of clothes* than the
usual never-changing outfit (or lack thereof).  I'm hoping they change
it again next season; heck, I'd settle for a different color jacket.

-Ronnie, thinks Sally would look great in green

Hello fellow Sonic fans.

Because I'm posting from Germany I'm not quite familiar with all the
'way past cool' stuff about Sonic. But I got subscriptions for the comic  
books and was also able to get a few cartoons on video. If you don't mind  
my bad grammar and vocabulary I would be glad if you would allow me to  
join your discussions.

Now here are a few questions I would like to ask:

Which cartoons are discussed here? The weekday cartoon (roughly drawn in  
which Robotnik is a nuthead with sidekicks like Grounder, Scratch and  
Coconuts) or the Sathurday morning cartoon (well made, interesting stories  
and Robotnik as a cleverly acting dictator)?

Which comics are discussed here? The one from Archie Comics Publications  
(with Sonic, Tails, Princess Sally, Bunnie, Rotor, Antoine etc., stories  
mainly based on the cartoons) or the one from Fleetway Publications (with  
Sonic, Tails, Amy Rose, Johnnie Lightfoot, Porker Lewis etc., stories  
mainly based on the games)?

Best wishes

Hi.

Has anyone seen the Sonic action figures they are always talking about on  
the Sonic-Grams page in the comic?

Quite all right.  I live in America, and have probably seen even less 
than you of Sonic's stuff.  (Funds go to things other than Sonic comics,

As far as I know, this question was first asked in issue #5 by Graham  
Smith, Turkey Creek, KY. The answer was that Sally is a _squirrel_, not a  
fox. This was asked again in #14, #16 and #17, always with the same  
result. In issue #19 there even was a question if Sally is a tree squirrel  
or a ground squirrel.

> According to the editor of Sonic The Hedgehog comic books, Tails

This was mentioned in issue #2 (regular series) in the story 'All the  
mail's about Tails!'. They took the funniest opinions of their readers  
about Tails two tails and put them into a two-page story. This particular  
idea came from Tom Kilroe, Tega Kay, SC.

Of course, I wouldn't rely too much on what the editors of the comic book  
tell you. To my opinion they tend to guess if they don't know the correct  
answer or they just try to avoid it. In issue #7 someone asked Sonic "Why  
are you so good-looking and smart and how old are you?". The answer was  
"The only way to remain _good looking_ is to be _smart_ and never reveal  
your _age_.".

However, in issue #16 someone said he had a chapter book that says Sonic  
is fifteen years old, and the editors immediately fell for it and approved  
it. Well, the only 15-year-old I know of is Knuckles (mentioned in the  
manual for 'Sonic III'.

Only my opinion... don't flame me

After reading all these responses and arguments and opinions about my 
reference  to Sally's species, I must input a vital issue...

It seems that for a very long time (respectively) the comic book artists/writers
and the SatAM show artists/writers were not conversing on just what SHOULD
BE the one true version of this epic "tail";)...As a result, each is having 
trouble
deciding on what to do next.  (ie. since Sally has apparently been refered to
as a ground squirrel in the comic, it's hard to say what she is in the cartoon)

I personally have always thought of her as a vixen (female fox), however, I
also have only been exposed to the cartoon show - which has never stated 
what she is one way or another.  Vixen status seemed to be reinforced 
after seeing her father, but I've even heard  arguments that HE isn't a fox! 
(those arguments were lost,BTW)  You may dissagree because it said 
different in the comic book, but as I said before, those 2 media haven't been
keeping tabs on one another very closely.(I don't know why)

Also, the Sonic books differ from both the comic & the show!

As for her mother, well, usually in royalty cross-breeding is discouraged.  
Besides, if you were going to write in a girlfriend for Sonic what better choice
than a vixen!  <droool> (followup in a.f.f) 

AS A RESULT, we have a big mess.  Unless the different media can work out a 
single, unified plot line with character development which explains Sally's 
species
(among many other things) there may never be an answer to this all important 
question...Sally, What is your name? 
(I fear that soon even this simple question could be skewed by the different 
media)

P.S. "Princess Sally Allicia" is what has been revealed in the show
        (In case you were wondering ;)      )

Which means the medical technology available to the rebels handles the 
problems of transplant rejection and nerve generation (not just 
*re*generation) almost trivially.  Not to mention the physics of the 
whole thing.  Unless they used magic.  (:3  Personally, I can't see 
myself parting with any of my own bodily parts unless they were 
threatening to tear other bodily parts out, but this adds a whole new 
dimension to Antoine's character.  Such as it is.  (;3

I have to admit, though, I have a weakness for the Happy Fun Fox (Tails, 
silly) myself, and have considered where his second tail comes from and 
how he uses it.  I had an image once, brainstorming late at night, of a 
dark future in which Robotnik's dealt some serious blows to the Freedom 
Fighters, one of which is Miles having had his trademark replaced by 
cybernetics...

By the way: there's a code in "Sonic 2" that changes all appearances of 
the word "Tails" in the game to "Miles".  Was his nickname added for the 
American version of the game and not in the original Japanese version?  
Anybody know?

EVERYBODY IS NEW HERE!

This list was officially open since the 3rd of Febuary! That's right, 5 days.
So please, write stuff! Don't be shy!
There are now 28 people on this mailing list. Get to know each other! 
Let's talk about more about sonic stuff.

I already said that I hate the new Rotor. Especially since he's now more 
of a decoration than a character. He was my favorite character until they 
cheezed him.
 
But Antione! We have got to get of him. Either that or have the rest of them
seriously start training him. A good ass kicking is what he needs! Though I
wouldn't mind him as a bad guy... Have I written this message before? I
honestly can't remember. Oh well, you have to read this, not me. :-)

I'm not sure how to add other poeples texted into a message but as far
as tail's tails goes, That was issue 2 and it was more or less a joke. It also
had other ideas from "Readers" which where listed like he is a mutant, even
showing him in an x-men type outfit. What you are talking about was that in one
panal, it said that "Tails actually has antoine's tail." Sonic says to antoine
that "Look like he's got your hair too." It was a joke. However, one idea that
I feel is a good one is that he IS kind of a mutant. With all the polution from
robotniks places, it could have caused Miles "Tails" To be born with two tails
insted of one. Just my idea.

I've never seen the weekday one, and probably you'll find that the list 
as a whole prefers the Saturday series.  I did intend the list to be open 
to both series.

I've never seen the Fleetway comics.  IMO, the games themselves are 
adequately represented in the Sega newsgroups and do not require further 
representation here.  I see no problem with stories based on the games, 
so let's include both comics series.  What I want to avoid is creating 
another place for "What are the cheats for...." and the like.

Hello again. I hope my messages are getting throu. Due to the fact that I have
NO idea how to add someone elses text in my message, I will have to try to
point my message the right way. Someone was talking about sally and how the
weekend show and the comic book where not quite the same. For those of you who
have most of the comic books like I do, You know that it was not until the last
5 or 7 issues that they started getting her color right. Up until then she was
a pinkish color. In the comic book, her name is sally acorn. I think what they
need to do is write up some kind of guidelines that both the tv show and the
comic book must fallow. Other wise, there is always going to be this big gap
between the show and the comic. I still think that tails is the best of the lot
but they never really went into a lot of background on him which is sad. Maybe
in up-comming issues and shows. By the way, Does anyone know when the new
season is going to start?
 
Craig / Tails

No, but I've seen some Sonic stuffed "animals".  They were out around 
X-mas but quickly disappeared *:(.  BTW, anyone know where I can get a 
Sonic keychain like the one they show on the Rear View Mirror of Rad 
Mobile or the Sega Planner in Game Players magazine.  (I think it was 
Game Players).

Well, since my first message, apparently didn't make it, I'm trying 
again.  I was going to say that if anybody here is interested in some 
Sonic fan-fiction and you have WWW access, feel free to stop by my 
homepage at:

http://www.primenet.com/~rotor

My FTP site will be up in a few days; I still have some bugs to work out.

P.S. -- For those of you wondering about Tails' second tail, try readin 
"Tails' Tale" in the above site.  The story isn't about his second tail, 
but Ido make a brief reference to how he got it.

See ya. . .

Hiyas.  Wow.  We're off to a big start here aren't we (re: This list)
Anyway.  Last night I went through all the Sonic comic books I had and
compiled the beginnings of what could be a FAQ list.

Before I get to it I wanted to make a few comments on what I've seen so far.

Alessandro Sanasi:  Don't worry about your English, its fine...  also, you
  mentioned a comic book by Fleetway Publications.  I never heard of it 
  before.  I also don't have anything to view ANSI graphics.. Hrm

Jeffery Pegnato:  Its true she doesn't have your typical squirrel tail
  (some ground squirrels have short tails) but I really can't envision her
  as a fox (well.. as a vulpine species).  I personally think she was 
  adopted or daughter by marriage.

List manager guy Majordomo: The address to mail to the list is kinda hidden
  in the welcome file.  Also, unless people provide .sigs with their e-mail
  address the mail headers I get don't have the return address.  ELM will
  attempt to send the mail to the whole list if I simply hit 'r' to reply.
  Is there a way to fix this from your end?  I've seen it done before but
  know next to zero about setting up a mailing list?

Sally's Vest & Species posts: I like the vest.  Gives her a bit more class.
  As for her species and the age of sonic.. I have some info about that in 
  my FAQ list.

Sonic Action Figures:  I haven't found any.  I have found two types of 
  plush sonics though (one from Sears and another I find in a videogame
  store.. Plush Tails too however I don't think his tails are big enough :)
  Mark Young.. that videogame store seems to still keep the plush sonics
  in stock [Its a chain called 'Software Etc.']

Tails's 2nd Tail:  The most plausable idea I've come up with is he's a 
  post-nuclear (or post-robotnik-pollution) mutant although SonicGrams in
  the comic book has a few others [see the FAQ list].

Mark Young:
Other comments... I've seen both the Weekday and ABC weekend series (although
Madison only gets the weekend series) and I prefer the weekend series by
far.  Probably because it takes everything way too seriously alot. :)

Yo Ratman!  You're absolutely right.  Rotor looks more like an ugly plush 
toy than a walrus.  Bring back the old style Rotor!  Antione is really 
annoying too.  The Princess Sally Miniseries #1 intro said Antione is 
around for his military skills...  Well, why don't they portray THAT once
in a while (have him at least do 'something' good for the group even if he's
a klutz and a fraidy-cat).

Hrm.  This letter is getting pretty long.  I'm going to send the FAQ as a 
separate file.

>>Fun info!

Sonic's Speed Settings  (From Sonic Miniseries #0)
1 Sub-Sonic:   For underwater work -- understand?
2 Ultra-Sonic: To look dashing while dashing!
3 Super-Sonic: When I've got the need for more speed!
4 Trans-Sonic: For passing fancy!.
5 Hyper-Sonic: Up to twice the speed of sound... don't 'mach' me out!
6 Warp-Sonic:  Lite speed - 1/3 faster than your regular bulb!

(7) Sonic Spin dash!

Robotnic's Rules (From Sonic #3)
1 No Reading
2 No Laughing
3 No Live Plants
4 ... (I don't have issue #3.. can someone help me?)


>>Questions and Answers!

Q:  What speed setting does Sonic have to go for his legs to turn into 
    those swirly things?

A:  Trans-Sonic


Q:  What color is Sally's hair?

A:  Good question!  
    In Sonic Miniseries 0 it was blond with red fur.
    In Sonic Miniseries 1-3 and Sonic 1-15 she's a brunette with pink fur.
    Sonic 16 and after she's a red-head with brown fur, just like on TV.  
    (They explained the color changes in SonicGrams #16; Archie writers had 
    little material to base her on until the TV series came out)

    In a side note:  The comic book tends to follow both the Saturday and
    Weekday television series but follows the Saturday series more closely.


Q:  What species is Sally?

A:  Squirrel! (Given in SonicGrams #5, #14, #16 and #17)
    (Ground squirrel according to SonicGrams #19)


Q:  What species is Antoine?

A:  Fox (Given in SonicGrams #12)


Q:  Sonic's Favorite Food?

A:  Chili Dogs!  "My favorite food gives me alot of.. 'Jet Propultion'"
    (Yup.. thats what Sonic said in SonicGrams #12 .. eeeww)


Q:  How did Tails get his 2nd tail?

A:  Reader mail in Sonic #2 gives a few possibilities:
      (1) Tails is a mutant!
      (2) Tails was created in Dr. Frankenstein's Lab
      (3) Tails has Antoine's tail!
    [(3) is my favorite]
    A reply in SonicGrams #9 states he was born that way.
    A reply in SonicGrams #16 states Antoine gave his tail to Tails so he
    could fly.  Hrm.. I guess (3) is Sonic's favorite answer too!
    
    Added comment:  (1) is the most plausable in my opinion.  With 
    Robotnik polluting everything you're bound to find some mutants.

Q:  How did Bunnie Rabbot get her robot arm and legs?

A:  Sonic saved Bunnie from being Roboticized but not before she gained 
    some robotic parts. (Given in SonicGrams #16)


Q:  Why is Miles Prower called Tails?

A:  Its a nickname.  He prefers Tails over Miles (wouldn't you?)


Q:  How old is Sonic?

A:  Back in SonicGrams #7 Sonic didn't want to reveal his age, but he 
    eventually said he was 15 (SonicGrams #16 and #18)


Q:  How old is Sally?

A:  Also 15 (SonicGrams IYF#1 and #20)


Q:  How old is Tails?

A:  Somewhere I heard he was 4 (perhaps a Sega Vision's magazine.. I 
    couldn't find it in SonicGrams) but a recent TV episode said he's 10.
    This seems a bit more plausable given Tail's personality.


Q:  Where is Mobius?
 
A:  SonicGrams #9 says the planet is in an unspecified point in space.
    (Cop-out answer)


Q:  Who was the king of Mobius?

A:  Sonic #10 shows a picture of the king.  He looks alot like an old male
    version of Sally.  This contradicts the TV series where he looked alot
    like a fox.  Sonic #17 first shows the king as he appears on TV as a
    fox (in Princess Sally's Crusade).

    Added note:  Very strange to be a squirrel princess while having a 
    fox king.  Perhaps Sally is an adopted daughter (or a daughter by
    marriage)

Feel free to make additions and corrections.  Remember this is based

Also.. Anyone know where I can get Sonic Miniseries issue #3?  I can 
back-order the others which I don't have.

Somebody (in r.a.a. maybe?) noted that the opening theme seems to have two 
different versions, one in which a certain furry is seen, and one in which 
he isn't.  I don't know about that, but the ones I've seen indicate that 
it's Tails with one _large_ tail.  Hmm, also, they're shown at their 
current ages, not the ones in Blast to the Past; oops, another continuity 
glitch... :^)

Then there's the suggestion (again, I forget by whom) that the giant foxbot 
seen in the opening credits is one of Tails' parents...

This is *exactly* what I meant by quality control.
The drawing you did wasn't bad, but you can see the lines on the notebook
paper! That's not exactly something that I would want to save on disk.
So please, only way past cool graphics.

Majordomo is the name of the software that manages the list.  Ratman and 
I are co-owners of the list.

I usually use pine for mail, and I've not had that problem.  The list 
messages arrive with both "From:" and "Reply-To:" fields in the headers.  
When I use "r", pine asks if I want to use Reply-To instead of From.  The 
Reply-To field is set to the list and the From field is set to the 
message's writer.  Elm should be configurable to work that way, but never 
having used it, I can't tell you what you need to do.

I'll review the intro file to see about moving the address for posting, 
and maybe make a few more tweaks at the same time.

I got my Sonic from Toys 'R' Us and Tails from Babbages, and Tails was 
much harder for me to get.  I'd like to see one of Sally.

	Night had fallen over the Great Forest.  All throughout Knothole, 
freedom fighters were retiring for the night.  Summer had just started, 
but the nights remained a little chilly in the Forest, considering it's 
somewhat high altitude.
	Tails lay in bed trying to go to sleep.  It was that time between 
getting in bed and actually going to sleep when one's mind wanders to all 
sorts of different thoughts and ideas.  Tails thought about lots of things 
during this time.  He turned his head slightly and looked out the window to
the stars above.  It's a beautiful night out, he thought to himself.  
Whenever he looked at the stars, he always paid attention to one specific 
constellation.  It was one that he remembered seeing all the time over 
his old home. 
	Home, he thought.  A day had never passed that he didn't think of 
it.  The peace, the tranquility, his parents.  He missed his parents a good
deal.  Missing them wasn't so bad, the problem was he didn't know if they 
were alive or dead, and, if they were alive, if they were robotizized or 
not.  It hadn't been that long ago when they were separated, only three 
years.  That had been when he was seven, but the memories were still 
fresh in his mind as if they had happened yesterday...

	The village of Bluebrook was a quiet little place populated by 
people living normal lives.  It was quite a distance away from Robotropolis.
So far in fact that, combined with the concealment by the natural landscape,
most thought that Robotnik would never find them.  All they had to do was 
keep a low profile.  It had been Tails' home for a long as he could 
remember.  His parents, Elrond and Sarah Prower, were kind, loving parents 
that tried to make their son's life as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.  
The one part of his life, however, that he had never agreed with was their 
choice of names.  When he was born, they had named him Miles.  It was a 
name that he had never liked, and, when he was four, started calling 
himself Tails because he thought that it suited him far better.  The 
young fox had, in fact, been born with two tails.  Not actually a birth 
defect, it was simply the result of a normally suppressed gene that had 
become dominant in his case.  Other than that, Tails' life was 
uneventful, but all that was about to change.

	Cmdr. Packbell sat at his desk in his secret room looking over 
information on his computer terminal.  He had been getting reports 
recently of freedom fighter activity from various locations around the 
planet, and it was up to him to eliminate them if he could.  It wasn't 
something that he was particularly concerned about given his perfect 
track record, except that he was always having to convince Robotnik of 
his ability.  He really hated Robotnik.  He found it hard sometimes to 
have the patience to wait for that one day when he would crush Robotnik 
and take his place as ruler of Mobius.
	Oh well, he thought.  He looked down the list of possible freedom 
fighter locations.  The list had ten names on it.
	No problem, thought Packbell, I'll just lay out a flight plan 
that takes me through all ten of them and nail whichever ones I can. 
	He smiled to himself as he began to lay out his strategy.

	Meanwhile, back in Bluebrook, life went about it's business.  
Elrond Prower was talking with the leader of the village, one Riff 
Underwood, a swift, smart rabbit with natural leadership abilities.
	"I think we might have a problem," Riff was saying "Recent 
reports indicate that there's been a good deal of activity in 
Robotropolis as of late."
	"Do you think it poses any type of threat to us?" asked Elrond.
	"Not at the moment, but it might," Riff replied "I'm going to 
order that this village keep as low a profile as possible.  If we draw any 
attention to ourselves in anyway the results would be disastrous."
	"Then it's to be hoped that we don't draw any attention," 
responded Elrond.
	He checked his chronometer.
	"Well, it's getting late," he said "I need to get home."
	"Good night, Elrond," said Riff.
	"Good night."
	
	Elrond arrived at his home to find his wife and son waiting for him.
	"So, what did you and Riff talk about all day?" asked Sarah as 
they sat down for dinner.
	"Not much," replied Elrond, glancing at Tails briefly "just the 
weather and the party next week."
	"That's good," remark Sarah.  She knew from his expression that 
he had more to say, but neither of them ever talked about such things in 
front of their son.
	"Oh, by the way," said Elrond "Riff and I are going to inspect 
some of the forest areas around the village tomorrow for possible look-out 
sites so I might be getting home a little late."
	"You always come home late, Dad," said Tails.
	"I know, Miles," said Elrond "but it's all for the good of the 
community.  You wouldn't want nasty old Robotnik to show up because we 
didn't take any precautions, would you?"
	"Bring him on!" said Tails excitedly "I'd run circles around him 
and beat him into the ground just like Sonic!"
	"You really believe in him don't you," remarked Sarah.
	"You bet.  Sonic's my hero," said Tails "Can I be excused."
	"Sure," said Elrond.
	Tails got up and left the room.  After he left, Sarah turned to 
her husband.
	"I think he listens to that travelling storyteller too much," 
Sarah said.
	"Well, it's good that he should have something to believe in," 
said Elrond "especially during times like these."
	"True enough I suppose," said Sarah "Now, what were you and Riff 
really talking about?"
	"There's been some concern lately that Robotnik's forces might 
locate this village," said Elrond quietly.
	"How much concern?" asked Sarah.
	"Well, it's not a real danger yet, but Riff feels we'll need to 
start taking more precautions from now on," said Elrond.
	"Well, I just hope that Robotnik never finds this place," 
remarked Sarah.
	"So do I," replied Elrond.
	The two foxes cleaned off the table as night fell into place.

	Later that night, Sarah entered Tails' bedroom and sat down 
beside him.
	"Would you like to hear a story before you go to bed Miles?" she 
asked, knowing what he'd say.
	"Yes!" he replied as he settled further into his bed.
	"What do you want to hear?" she asked.
	"Tell me more about what it was like before the war," he asked 
sleepily.
	Sarah smiled at her son.  Tails had been born one year after 
Robotnik had taken control of the planet.  For as long as he could 
remember, there was the war and nothing else.  Sarah sat back in her 
chair and started to speak.
	"Before the war, there was clean air and sunshine.  People were 
free and could go where ever they wished.  We were ruled by a good and wise 
King.  He made sure that every citizen was provided with what they 
needed and that the balance between nature and technology was  maintained. 
There were pure white clouds in the sky.  There were large open fields 
where you could run and play and not feel yourself in any danger.  You 
didn't have to hide yourself away when certain people came by.  In 
Mobitropolis, there was once a beautiful fountain outside the royal 
palace.  In the diamond mountains there was a time where you could 
surround yourself in rainbows if the light from the rising sun struck 
them just right.  Mobius was a place of beauty, peace, joy, and freedom."
	Sarah looked down at her sleeping child.  Despite all the love 
she held for him, it hurt to see him sometimes.  He was growing up in a 
world that would not allow him to take advantage of the things she 
herself had once known.  The world of a peaceful Mobius was just a 
fantasy in his mind instead of the wonderful reality she had taken for 
granted.  These days she only held one true hope in her heart and that 
was that her son should have a chance to see a peaceful Mobius.  One 
that wasn't at war.  Neither she nor Elrond mattered now.  She wanted 
her son to know peace.  She wanted him to know, to feel, the wonderful 
feelings and experiences that she and Elrond held in their memories.  
Standing quietly, she turned out the light and left the room.

	As the night passed, Pacbell's forces moved swiftly but silently 
through the skies.  Pacbell was feeling very pleased with himself.  He 
had managed to capture 245 freedom fighters so far and there were only two 
village names left on his list.  With any luck, he decided, he should 
have them taken care of by noon the next day.

	The next morning as promised, Elrond left to go meet Riff at the 
edge of the village.  They had only been exploring the area for twenty 
minutes when their sensors picked up something.
	"What is it," asked Riff.
	Elrond studied the reading a moment longer.
	"I think it's a robotropolis attack force," Elrond said nervously.
	"We've got to get back and warn the village!" exclaimed Riff.
	The two ran back to the village as fast as they could go.

	Meanwhile, deep in The Great Forest, at the top secret freedom 
fighter village of Knothole, life was proceeding normally.
	Princess Sally was sitting in front of her communications 
monitoring console fixing a few things when it suddenly picked up a faint 
transmission on a coded frequency.  Dropping what she was doing, Sally 
had NICOLE break the code and display the resulting message on the screen:

PRIORITY MESSAGE TO ROBOTROPOLIS CENTRAL COMMAND

FROM: CMDR. PACKBELL
SERVICE NO.:  546003-3F

REPORT:
	SEARCH AND CAPTURE MISSION IS A SUCCESS.  CURRENTLY FINISHING 
OPERATION ON BLUEBROOK VILLAGE.  NUMBER CAPTURED AS OF THIS TIME -- 304.  
ESTIMATED TIME TO FINISH -- 5:00 MINUTES. . .

--- PACKBELL

	Realizing the urgency of the situation, Sally jumped up and ran 
to get the others.

	Meanwhile, the village of Bluebrook was in utter chaos.  
Creatures were fleeing in every direction to escape the Swat-bots 
marching through the village.  Some tried to fight them, but it was a 
hopeless battle.  Through the panic, Packbell walked confidently, taking 
pot shots at everything that moved, not really caring what he hit.  As 
he walked through the village, he relished the screams of terror and the 
sight of panicked creatures fleeing for their lives.  To a twisted mind 
like his, this was paradise.
	When it was finally over, he totalled up the captures as the 
surviving prisoners were marched into the transports.
	"25 foxes, 43 ferrets, 12 rabbits, 13 raccoons, and 5 hedgehogs," 
he noted to himself "not a bad score at all."
	He smiled a little as he turned and went back to his private 
shuttle to return to Robotropolis with his latest catch.

	A short while later, a stolen shuttle landed in the middle of 
what was once a village of peace.  Sally, Bunnie, Rotor, and Bookshire 
emerged as Sonic raced up to meet them.
	"We're too late," Sonic said "the place is deserted."
	The five were silent for a moment before Sally spoke.
	"Very well," she said "It looks like all that left is to clean 
up.  Bunnie and I will check for anything salvageable.  Sonic, you can 
patrol the perimeter for danger.  Bookshire and Rotor will count the 
casualties."
	The five went about the grim task that Robotnik's forces left for 
them.

	"Well done, indeed, commander," Robotnik was saying "I'd promote 
you if you weren't already in one of the highest positions in the central 
command."
	"Of course, sir," responded Packbell.
	"So, since I can't promote you, you can just keep doing what 
you've been doing and be happy with that," said Robotnik.
	"Thank you, sir," answered Packbell flatly.  He turned on his 
heel and left, kicking Snively roughly to one side as he passed.
	Packbell went down to the main robotization center where those 
whom he had captured were being put through the Robotizizer.  As they went, 
some shouted defiance and threats, others begged for mercy and their 
lives, others simply cried.  Some where still in shock and remained silent.
	As Packbell watched, he noted two foxes with calm, collected 
expressions. Two who had apparently resigned themselves to their fate.  
Either that or they what to be Martyrs sacrificing themselves for their 
cause, thought Pacbell.
	"Oh well," he said to himself "too bad there's no one around to 
make a note of it for the history books."
	Pacbell turned and left the machines to their work.

	At the site of the ruins of what was once the village of 
Bluebrook, the freedom fighters continued with their tasks.
	Bookshire was crouched by a fallen creature looking for 
identification when Rotor walked up.
	"There are two more back behind that building," he said.
	Bookshire sigh in response.  He located and ID card and silently 
read it.
	"Riff Underwood, village leader," he said quietly "what a loss."
	"This is a nightmare," grumbled Rotor.
	"I know," responded Bookshire as he stood "Well, that just about 
does it, let's find Sally."
	
	Sally and Bunnie were picking through the wreckage looking for 
anything they might be able to use.  As they picked through the rubble of 
one of the houses, they suddenly heard a noise that sounded as if it had 
come from one of the back rooms.  The two walked carefully through the 
debris and into what must have, at one time, been a bedroom. The room 
wasn't quite as messy as the rest of the house.  Apparently, the bots 
didn't search it.  As they enter the room, Sally and Bunnie heard something 
under the bed.  When they bent down to look, a surprising sight met 
their eyes.
	Crouched under the bed with his face buried in his arms and 
trembling uncontrollably was a small fox that couldn't be any more than 
seven or eight at the most.  The two tried getting his attention, but it 
soon became obvious that he had been terrified out of his senses.
	"Bunnie," said Sally "we need to get at him.  Can you move this bed?"
	"Sure thing," replied Bunnie.  She seized the bed with her 
robotic arm and moved it easily to one side.
	As they knelt down next to him, Bookshire and Rotor entered.  
They were momentarily startled by the appearance of a survivor, but they 
continued with their report.
	"We're all finished," said Rotor "we counted thirty-five."
	"Thank you very much," said Sally "This disaster, as you can see, 
has taken a new twist."
	Bookshire knelt down beside the fox and examined him.
	"Looks like extreme shock," he concluded.
	"Yes, that was my guess too," said Sally "Needless to say, we'll 
take him back to Knothole with us when we leave."
	"Good idea," said Sonic as he raced up "there's a swat-bot patrol 
heading this way."
	Bunnie picked up the fox and they ran back to the shuttle where 
they took off and headed back to Knothole at top speed.

	When they arrived back at Knothole, the fox had been placed in a 
spare room just adjacent to Sally's room where he began his recovery from 
the terrible events he had witnessed.  It wasn't until three days later 
that he came around and was actually conscious of his surroundings.  
When he first opened his eyes, Sally and Sonic were sitting beside the bed.
	"You don't need to be afraid," Sally assured him "you're with 
friends."
	"Who are you?" the fox asked a little shakily.
	"My name is Sally, and this is Sonic," replied Sally "and what's 
your name?"
	"My real name is Miles, but I like Tails," Tails replied "Are you 
really Sonic the Hedgehog?"
	"Indeed I am," said Sonic "You've heard of me?"
	"Are you kidding?" exclaimed Tails, brightening up considerably 
"You're my hero!  Every time the traveling storyteller came to my 
village, he did nothing but talk about you!  Are you really as fast as 
they say you are?"
	"Am I fast!? Am I fast!?. . .,"began Sonic.
	Sally rolled her eyes.  Here we go again, she thought.
	"Is the sky blue, is dirt dirty?  I'm the fastest thing on the 
face of the planet!" said Sonic, proudly.
	"Wow," remarked Tails.  He was completely awestruck.  After all 
of the stories he had heard, he had finally met his hero.
	Oh well, thought Sally, at least that should make his recovery 
easier.

	And, in fact, the recovery went very smoothly.  It did take some 
time for Tails to come to terms with the fact that he had been separated 
from his parents and that it wasn't likely he'd see them again for quite 
a while, but he accepted it eventually.  His parents had taught him well to 
accept whatever life gave him.  It didn't mean he liked his situation, 
but he had accepted that that's the way it was.  During one of the first 
nights he spent in Knothole, he promised himself that he'd find his parents 
again one day, and, until then, he had good friends that would look out 
for him and take care of him until he did.  One day, he'd find them again.
	One day . . .

	Tails drifted of to sleep quietly that chilly night at the 
beginning of Summer. Those last words and the images of the past were 
that last things in his mind before it collapsed into sleep.
	Night passed in The Great Forest.  Every freedom fighter slept 
peacefully.  Each one held the dream that one day they would find true 
happiness again with loved ones they had lost.  each one waited patiently 
for that one day when peace would once again reign over Mobius and they 
would be able to live normal lives again.  Deep in their hearts, they 
knew that day would come.  All these things would almost certainly come to 
pass. . . 

. . . one day.

I suppose that's one of the advantages of hating my stories, I'm 
downright surpirised and glad when someone says something good about 
them.  I agree that the show should do an episode like that and, in this 
next season, I certainly hope they do.

P.S. -- In case anybody was wondering about the extra characters in that 
story, Bookshire Draftwood is a 36 year old raccoon who's been and 
unofficial member of the freedom fighters for about five years.  Cmdr. 
Packbell is an android constructed by Dr. Robotnik. He is one of the more 
feared ememies on the face of Mobius.

The comic from Fleetway Publications is available in England. Translated  
versions have already spread into at least three other countries (Germany,  
Holland, Italy and France).

You may order some of them yourself, if you like. The price is 1.10 pounds
sterling for each issue, including postage & packing. Minimum order is
4.40. Checks must be payable to _Fleetway Editions Ltd._ and must be in
pounds sterling.

The mail address is:    SONIC BACK ISSUE ZONE
                        Aim Ltd.
                        PO Box 10
                        Sunderland, SR4 6SN

To order by phone with a credit card you have to dial 01144-91-5102290
(hope this is the correct number to do it from the U.S.)

The title is 'Sonic The Comic' the latest issue so far is #43.

I never thought that I would write this, but I have to admit that I like  
the Sonic comic from Fleetway a little more than the one from Archie. The   
artwork is great, the stories are thrilling and interesting and not just a  
put-together of scenes from the game without a 'real' plot like Archie did  
it in issue #6 (The spin doctor) or issue #13 (This island hedgehog).

The Fleetway stories even have a well-developed background about Sonics  
origin and all that. Maybe one of you has seen the Sonic comic that was  
printed as an advertising supplement in 'Disney Adventures Magazine'
Vol. 2 Number 1 in November 1991 (the issue with Michael Jordan on the  
cover). The Fleetway comic uses the same background information.

[snip]

Basically, everything starts on the day when Sonic accidentally burrows  
into Dr. Kintobors secret underground laboratory. At this time he looks a  
lot like an average hedgehog with brownish color and _lots_ of quills. The  
doctor shows him his newest invention, the Retro Orbital Chaos Compressor  
(ROCC, for short), a device that attracts all evil forces on Mobius and  
locks it inside the six emeralds within the machine.

Sonic and the doctor become friends. To test Sonics speed, the doctor lets  
him train on his experimental supersonic treadmill. But Sonic runs so fast  
that he breaks the sound barrier and is turned into the blue speedster we  
all know. Because he burnt up his sneakers Kintobor makes him a pair of  
frictionless red shoes to wear.

Later Kintobor asks Sonic to bring him a soda and a hardboiled egg for  
lunch. By accident the doctor spills the soda over the control panel of  
the ROCC. The following explosion shatters the ROCC's containment rings  
and emeralds everywhere and zaps Kintobor with 10.000 volts of pure evil  
energy, turning him into an evil, hardboiled, robotic nutcase. From this  
time on, Kintobor is known as Robotnik (Kintobor spelled backwards). Since  
then Sonic is collecting all the lost rings, because he wants to put the  
ROCC back together and reverse the process.

[snap]

All right, now lets count all the grammatical errors I've made (just  
kidding...)

The current group of Freedom Fighters in the Fleetway comic are:

Sonic the Hedgehog (of course)
Tails              (Sonics trusty little buddy)
Amy Rose           (Sonics lady hedgehog friend from the 'Sonic CD' game)
Porker Lewis       (a pig with ambitions in computer and technology)
Johnnie Lightfoot  (a hare who joins Sonic in the fights against Robotnik)

I wouldn't want that eighter. There are far enough postings like 'What are  
the cheats for Sonic & Knuckles' and the like in the SEGA newsgroups.

They corrected Sallys color in issue #16. However, Sally _has_ pink fur  
and dark hair in the sathurday morning cartoon episode 'Heads or Tails'.

To my opinion the comic is a mixup of _both_ cartoon series _and_ the  
video games, making a complete mess out of it. However, the first three  
issues of the mini-series (drawn by Scott Shaw!) were the best I've seen
for years, both in artwork and storyline.

The comic editors claim to work 'hand in hand' with SEGA, but I believe  
they just do what they want including the use of characters from other  
comics (issue #8 'Bot's all, folks' or issue #19 'Night of 1000 Sonics')
or adaptions from well-known movies/books like Frankenstein or King Kong  
(issue #17 'Gorilla Warfare').

Maybe the editors just _don't know_ anything about Tails background...?

Just my opinion - don't flame me

Actually, there is no problem with the address.  Everyone I've spoken to 
so far had no problems accessing it.  Perhaps the problem might have 
something to do with your location.  Perhaps the address is different for 
people in other countries.  Also, I think that if your network doesn't 
have links to the right networks, or if the links are temporarily down, 
then you get the UNKNOWN SERVER. These are all just theories.  I really 
am not sure why you can't access.  

By the way, I posted "Tails' Tale" here on the list I hope you got it.  I 
know it got posted because it got sent back to me and I'm been getting 
responses from it.

Oh, and here's something more useful, think of it a reward

I have a directory for sonic stuff in my ftp directory.

ftp.mv.com
/pub/users/rat/sonic/

put stuff in /pub/users/rat/incoming/
and if it doesn't blow, I'll put it in the sonic directory
tree somewhere.

ANSI is not a graphics file format. It's something like a con-driver or
display-driver. Let me explain:

When you want to display a short textfile on your screen (hope
you are using a DOS machine) you just write 'TYPE FILENAME' or
'COPY FILENAME > CON' at the DOS prompt and the text will be
displayed on your screen.

An ANSI file is nothing else but a textfile containing some characters of
the actual charset. But the ANSI codes that are added to each character
allow it to give them different colors. When this is cleverly arranged, it
produces a picture like ASCII-art, but with color in it.

To view the file I sent to you, just copy it to the screen. It's as simple
as that. If your computer doesn't support ANSI, try looking for ANSI.SYS
in your DOS directory, insert the line 'DEVICE=ANSI.SYS' in your
CONFIG.SYS file, boot your computer and try again.

Best wishes


A. Sanasi

A cartoon merch store in my area (Newcastle, Australia) keeps itself
well stocked with high-quality (& expensive..:( Sonic adult+children
sized T-shirts (boxers, bike helmets, pillowsheets??).  The majority
of the gear is made in this country by "Acme", but under licence.

(Everyone here is invited to remind me to check that place out again
ASAP and get descriptions of everything :o) and maybe compare with
what's already listed on SegaOA's Wpages.  Don't have IP, so I can't
check for myself..)

>>Questions and Answers!

Q:  What color is Sally's hair?

A:  Good question!
    In Sonic Miniseries 0 it was blond with red fur.
    In Sonic Miniseries 1-3 and Sonic 1-15 she's a brunette with pink fur.
    Sonic 16 and after she's a red-head with brown fur, just like on TV.
    (They explained the color changes in SonicGrams #16; Archie writers had
    little material to base her on until the TV series came out)

    Sally _had_ pink fur and brunette hair in the sathurday morning TV      
    episode 'Heads or Tails'


Q:  Why is Miles Prower called Tails?

A:  Its a nickname.  He prefers Tails over Miles (wouldn't you?)

    I believe they wanted to do something like a 'word joke' with that      
    name: Miles Prower -> miles per hour


Q:  How old is Sonic?

A:  Back in SonicGrams #7 Sonic didn't want to reveal his age, but he
    eventually said he was 15 (SonicGrams #16 and #18)

    It was Ben Fraser, Cranbrook, BC who said it. To my opinion the         
    editors just fell for it because they didn't know any better and
    the argument that Ben saw Sonics age in a chapter book sounded
    reasonable.


Q:  How old is Tails?

A:  Somewhere I heard he was 4 (perhaps a Sega Vision's magazine.. I
    couldn't find it in SonicGrams) but a recent TV episode said he's 10.
    This seems a bit more plausable given Tail's personality.

    The manual for the game 'Sonic the Hedgehog II' says that Tails is six  
    and a half years old (of course, the age of a character is nothing      
    that is fixed forever...)

Thanks for the additions...

I typed that up quickly in one night.  After looking it over it could use 
some editing.  Also, that other guy (Dan) had come up with his own Sonic
FAQ listing which seems overall more complete.  At least I answered the 
infamous "when does Sonic's legs become those swirly things" question.

> Sonic's Speed Settings  (From Sonic Miniseries #0)

I don't know why I didn't include this line.

I remember that 'Heads or Tails' episode.. I gotta re-watch it.  I don't 
recall the color changes but I DO recall that it was one of the only episodes 
where Tails actually flew (in the first season).  Didn't it also have lots of 
minor differences such as:
  No Nicole... Sally used some other computer
  Rotor was the big 'eating machine'
  The robots weren't the same as in other episodes
  Sonic with his guitar
  Robotnic's plan was overall pretty silly (Hedgehog-seeking missle?)
The episode also introduced what happened to Uncle Chuck and Muttski.

My guess is it was a 'pilot' episode before they worked out what they wanted
to do with the series.  Can anyone confirm that?

Another note.. I FINALLY got this 'Miles Prower -> Miles PerHour' joke 
(about an hour or two before getting your e-mail).

And now for something completely different:  Who is that purple guy in the
Sonic 'Triple Trouble' (for Game Gear) game and how come we haven't seen 
him anywhere else?

I had a similar experience. I told someone his take was "miles prower" and he
tought I said miles per hour. He didn't even know I said miles prower! Oh
well, had I said it out loud before, maybe I would have gotten it! :-)

That episode was remarkably similar to the comic book. My guess is that 
it was the pilot episode, and the look of it and the plotline were lifted 
straight from the Archie comic. ABC sent it back and told them to write 
the rest for an older age bracket. (this is all just theory here) So DIC 
went ahead, wrote the "game robots" (buzz bomber and the like) out of the 
plot and redid the look. I don't mind in the least.

No, as far as I know of.  That's supposed to be in the FAQ we've been 
expecting from drazen@andrews.edu.  Anyone heard from him lately?  I 
don't think he's even subscribed to this list yet.

Please do post or mail a list of what they offer.  Then I'll see if I can 
splice together all of our findings for a beta version of the merchandise

Q: How old is Tails?
A: In the weekday show, He is 4 3/4 (Almost 5.) In the weekend show he is 10.
Possable tie in to weekend show and weekday show would be that Sonic (biing
about 10-11) and tails meet the others some time after that. Note that in drood
henge that sonic said "I've been doing solo missions when I was 10" When
defending the choic of letting tails go on the mission. However, This is just
an idea and by no means the way it is. But it could be.

   You never know, he could be a spy.  Or an outcast.  Robotnik didn't even

I've been trying to figure out how the characters and places that are used 
in the show were named... 

For starters -

Sally is the pet name for Sarah, which means (guess) - "princess"

Sonic is obvious enough - as in the speed of sound

Bunnie, Rotor, Snively, Robotnik and Tails are also obvious from their 
respective traits. (However "Miles" needs research)

I have no explanation yet for  "Mobius".  There must be some kind of 
significance
in this name - I doubt they just made it up.

More to come...

What about Antoine?  OK, the French part is obvious.  But Antoine is a 
form of Anthony, and my name dictionary says of Anthony: "inestimable, 
priceless one".  Considering how he fell asleep and let a power ring get 
appropriated -- among many other things -- he's not exactly the most 
valuable of the Freedom Fighters.  Not that I'd want him roboticized, but 
doesn't he ever do anything useful?

As for Uncle Chuck, the name comes from Charles which my name dictionary 
defines as "strong, manly".  Though he may be getting older, no ordinary 
hedgehog would choose to fight Robotnik the way he does.

"Nicole" is a good name to have on our side.  It's defined as "victorious 
army, victorious people".

I've got to really be curious about Rosie.  That's defined as "queen of 
flowers".  And Dulcie (Dulcy) is "Sweet one".

how about the end of the 11year war against Robotnik? Come  to think of it,
Antoine is probably fighting for what all the other freedom fighters are 
fighting for - 
the chance to once again live in peace with the ones they love (family ties are
often the strongest against any other)  Love is a powerful motivator, but 
Antoine 
seems to regard a relationship with Sally more as a status symbol rather than 
a true love relationship.  This is seen in several episodes where he fawns over
her in a very drool manner (Like Pepe le Pew).    (IMHO, of course)  ;)

BTW, where did  Antoine say he wanted to be "king of Camelot"?

On the cartoon, we often hear about quadrants and sectors, and Nicole 
sometimes gives us information about places too.

Does DIC do any location planning when preparing new scripts?  Or has 
Sega already done it?  Ultimately, is it possible to draw a map of 
Mobius?  Obviously, a map would need to be drawn in such a way that it 
won't reveal exactly where Knothole is, just in case Robotnik or Snively 
should get their hands on one.  But we net.freedom-fighters can keep a 
secret.

My first thought after seeing that there was a Sonic mailing list
available:

"Cool.  Maybe I can learn a little more about the games and possibly
find out if the cartoon is worth watching."

My first thought after receiving the welcome file:

"That was quick!  Less than two minutes!"

My first thought after viewing my first round of messages:

"Sonic, Tails, waitaminute...who in the world is Sally?"

That'll teach me to skim thru and quickly file away the "Welcome"!
But now, a few days later, I've become enlightened to what this group
is really about.  And (needless to say?) I am entranced.

Y'see, I've always had a fascination for animal fiction.  I list
_Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH_ as one of my all-time favorite books,
I've enjoyed just about every movie that Don Bluth has put out
(at least until Rock-a-Doodle), and I kept up with the weekday cartoon
of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, before the writers ditched the
continuity and turned it into the usual children's cartoon drivel.
One of these days, I'm gonna find a copy of _Watership Down_ to read,
since it's been almost a decade since I last saw the movie.
And need I mention the excellent tongue-in-cheek humor of the
Animaniacs?  I'm even attempting to create my own such fiction,
with one story revolving around Felicia, the cat-woman from the
video game "Dark Stalkers."

Unfortunately, such works are few and far between.  So, when something
new comes along that promises good story telling involving such 
"humanly animal" characters, I'm all ears.  And what a story "StH" is!
A small, renegade group of animals doing whatever they can to stay
alive and fight against an evil, Hitler-esque ruler.  This battle
has raged on for more than a decade.  Families have been lost, friendships
torn apart.  Of the main characters, one has had to helplessly watch her
father's kingdom plundered and run into the ground, another lost his
entire family barely after he learned how to talk, and still another
questions exactly what he is fighting for or against, when the bad guys
don't seem to pay him any attention, and the good guys chastise him for
his accidental nature (sorta like Harold Lauder from _The Stand_).
Combine all this with the sci-fi/fantasy setting of powerful, mysterious
crystals and the cruel combination of biology and technology...
THIS is the stuff of classic literature!!

And so, I dove in...or at least attempted to.

It seems I'm having a little trouble getting my "Sonic fixes".  After
looking in the TV Guide, I found out our local ABC affiliate has
dropped almost the entire Sat. morning line-up for a news program.
Some of the shows got farmed out to local independant channels, but
"StH" is lost in the cracks.

Then, I went out to one of Atlanta's most reknown comic book stores,
"Oxford Comics" and bought all I could find---which turned out to
be only two issues, #17 and #21.  And after reading these two and reading
the synapses of the cartoon shows from the Sonic FAQ, it looks that the
cartoon pays much better attention to the story telling than the
comic book does (why in the world did Archie Publications have to
pick this one up?!).  Oh well, I'll keep trying.

And so, I have a request.  Does anyone know if the cartoons have
been released on video yet?  If not, does anyone happen to have
the cartoons taped, and would be willing to mail me a copy?  I'd
gladly pay the cost of videotape and shipping.

Well, sorry if this intro went a little overboard, but I just wanted
to convey what an excellent forum this is.  Here's hoping there'll
be a 3rd season to the show, and that Channel 2 will finally start
showing the @#$^$% things!! :-)

later---Kris

Just a figure of speech Jeff!  I'm sure Ant isn't up on Earth history!
What I mean by king of Camelot is that it seemed that, as you said,
Antoine saw a union with the Princess as a status symbol, and that
his persuit of her seemed based upon a childish dream and not real
love.  I'm sure he loves her, don't get me wrong.  But if you think of
it, the poor guy hasn't really adjusted to life after the coup and one
can't blame him for wanting to escape into dreamland. He wants peace and
freedom as badly as the rest of the FF do!   Of course,
finding true love won't solve all his problems, but it sure would be a
good start!  The fellow's not getting any younger!

To a free Mobius!
Long Live Princess Sally!

Greetings!

I'd just like to take this opportunity to announce that I have a WWW site 
where I store my fan fiction for Sonic.  At the moment it just has the 
four short stories I wrote for my friends on AOL.  Eventually, it will 
have Sonic screen shots as well.
If you have access to the WWW then go to the following URL:

http://www.primenet.com/~rotor

If enough people tell me they don't have Web access, I might post them here.

See ya in cyberspace!

Fleetway Publications???  Now that's a new name to me.  I thought the 
Archie comic was the only one.  Could you please post some subscription 
information?

Isn't it interesting that two posts I made four days ago suddenly showed 
up now?  Hey, list owners, whats happening here?

To CamCoon:
You're right the Antoine probably loves Sally, but I will definitly agree 
with you that he wants to marry her for the status.  His general behavior 
throughout the series suggests that if she were anything other than a 
Princess and the next in line for the throne, Antoine, most likely, 
wouldn't have much to do with her.  His attitude to individuals of lower 
status is inexcusable.  In one episode, in fact, he refers to the others 
as lowly phesants.  This is a sure sign of a person that thinks he's 
better than everyone else and only he desrves to be on the throne.  

I once said:
"Bottom line Antoine -- Get a life or get the heck out of here."

Now, more than ever, there's nothing truer than that.

I don't know, it seems to me that there's one simple rule that DIC uses 
to come up with new locations:
Pick some kind of terrain (Forest, Swamp, Jungle, Mountains)
Add the word "Great" in front of it. (the Great Forest)

I know that this isn't the rule that they use 100% of the time, but 
still, it's kinda funny that Mobius has all its greatest land features in 
such close proximity.

Yet another person who likes "The Secret of NIMH".  That was one heck of 
a good movie.

They have, in fact, released SOME of the Sonic cartoons on video. You 
have to look real close at the packages to tell the differnce between the 
weekday sholw and the weekend show.  They're also priced at about twelve 
bucks a tape which has two episodes.  I'll tell you what I'll do:  I have 
all the episodes from the first season and all the episodes from this 
season except the last two, which will air again in about two and three 
weeks.  If you like, I'll ship you the entire collection when it's 
finshed in that time(which amounts to approx. 26 episodes) for only $10.  
I believe that will cover the two video tapes and postage needed.  If 
you're intersted, please respond by private E-mail

Also, if it's been a decade since you've seen "Watership Down", I think I 
should tell you that they released it on video from Warner Bros. Home Video.
I noticed that screen shot from the movie are also available for downlaod 
at ftp.mv.com/pub/users/rat/watership.

ANNOUNCEMENT TO EVERYONE:
My FTP site is now active.  It only contains my Sonic short stories now, 
but, soon, it will have screen shots from, "Sonic the Hedgehog", "The 
Secret of NIMH", and "Watership Down".  The address is

I put the mailing list on our fastest machine. Most appropriate for a 
"sonic" mailing list, wouldn't you say?

Me too! Check out my ftp directory. I have some NIMH pictures. Rats are a 
hobby of mine.

I also have some Watership Down pictures.

And of course, I have a sonic directory. :-)

See my signature for the location of my ftp directory.

I will restate this for those who don't know:

YOU ARE ALL NEW HERE.
This mailing list is under 2 weeks old.
I know that you might have known that, but I'm writing this so everyone

You were right. I tried it again and it worked fine.

You have really great stories there. You should post them _ALL_ here for  
those who can use e-mail only.

There must be at least one other episode in which the Freedom Fighters  
meet Sonics roboticized uncle Chuck. By using a power ring uncle Chuck  
regains his memory about his non-robot existence before the transformation  
and helps destroying one of Robotniks machines. However, Sonic has to  
leave his uncle behind because the effect of the power ring wears off  
before they can escape.

This episode _might_ already been listed above, but I don't know the  
title. Please check for yourself.

Who says 'Heads or Tails' isn't worth describing?? Of course this episode  
has _some_ 'fun' elements like the 'hedgehog seeking missile' or the
not-so-intelligent buzzbomber robots. But apart from that, it has  
_everything_ that made the sathurday morning cartoon so famous and  
fascinating. This episode really is _not_ like the weekly series or the  
comic, which have nothing but slapstik and horrible artwork all over.

Just my opinion - don't flame me

After several requests, I have decide to post all of the short stories 
which I've written on the list.  They will make up the next few posts 
from my address and consist of the following:

Character Profiles -- This will be a list of three original characters 
that I developed specifically for this series.  You'll see them turn up 
every now and again.

"Ill Will" -- Sally and Tails have been captured by Robotnik.  On top of 
that, Tails is very sick.  Can Sonic rescue them in time?

"Bunnie Rabbot" -- My little theory on how bunnie was robotizized.

"Merry Christmas" -- A lot of people told me that they don't have 
Christmas on Mobius and they're probobly right, but, it was December and 
it's all I was in the mood for writing.

"Tails' Tale" (repost for those people who weren't here two days ago)
The story of how Tails joined the freedom fighters.

Sonic the Hedgehog:  Character Profiles
by David Pistone
The author of this work will accept questions and comments via E-mail at 
any 
of the following addresses:
67116@ef.gc.maricopa.edu      bookshire@aol.com    rotor@primenet.com

	This is a list of descriptions of the three original characters 
that I created for my Sonic The Hedgehog stories.  This document's 
purpose is simply for reference when you encounter one of the characters 
in the story.

Profile: 01
Name:  Bookshire Draftwood
Species:  Raccoon
Sex:  Male
Age:  36
War Standing:  rebel sympathizer
Occupation:  Great Forest Freedom Fighter (unofficial)
Specialties:  computer and medical technology

Summary:  Bookshire is a middle-aged raccoon who, before the take over, 
made a living doing numerous jobs from computer hacking to doctor.  He was 
always bouncing around from one job to another because he had never been 
exactly sure what he wanted to do with his life.  
	He was fortunate enough to be vacationing down on the southern 
continent of Mobius when Robotnik took control of the capital city and 
slowly began to conquer the entire planet.  He managed to slip by 
Robotnik's forces and return to the capital city which was then in 
ruins.  He was almost captured by a patrol when he tried to break into 
the computer system from a workstation.  By some miracle, he managed to 
escape and spent the next two years wandering about aimlessly, unsure of 
how to handle all that had happened.  During his wanderings, he had a 
few run ins with robotnik's patrols.  During one of these encounters, he 
fell and broke his right leg.  The break had never healed quite right 
and it left him with a permanent limp.
	After two years he wandered into the Great forest where he 
accidentally ran into the freedom fighters who convinced him to stay with 
them.  Since then, he has proven to be a valuable asset, first busting 
into Robotnik's mainframe, as well as numerous other services.


Profile:  02
Name:  Packbell
Species:  Artificial Lifeform  (humanoid)
Sex:  Male simulation
Age:  8
War standing:  Robotnik sympathizer
Occupation:  Commander, 1st class, Robotropolis Central Command
Specialties:  offensive and defensive battle strategies, robotizizing 
people, pushing Snively around

Summary:  Packbell is the first android in the history of Mobius to be 
declared a fully functioning artificial lifeform.  He possesses 
intelligence, self-awareness, as well as basic emotions.  He was a 
prototype designed by Robotnik just after the takeover, but the fact 
that the android turned out to be as smart as he was caused Robotnik to 
scrap the entire project.
	Since the takeover, Packbell has been personally responsible for 
the location and destruction of twelve groups of rebel freedom fighters and 
the consequent capture and robotization of over 400 citizens.  He track 
record is flawless, and he never loses.  Despite having basic emotions, 
most freedom fighters throughout the globe know that he never shows 
anyone any mercy.  
	When he's not terrorizing rebels, he hangs around the 
Robotropolis Command Center either goofing off or finding ways to annoy 
Snively.  He is considered to be arrogant and conceited.  What is not 
well known is that, under his loyal exterior, he waits patiently for the 
time when he can overthrow Robotnik and rule Mobius himself.


Profile:  03
Name:   Sandra Nightweaver
Species:  Fox
Sex:  Female
Age:  29
War standing:  neutral
Occupation:  Global informant and spy
Specialties:  breaking into places, ability to get information out of 
anyone or anything.

Summary:  Sandra is a loner who, before the take over, made her living 
getting and selling information to whoever made it worth her while.  She 
has even had brief run ins with the authorities before the take over.  
	Now, in this time of rebellion, she has found that her profession 
has escalated and she has been known to do espionage and spy work for 
both the rebellion and for Robotnik.  She doesn't care who is in charge so 
long as she's allowed to go about her business.  When she's not spying, 
she's usually found around places such as the Mystic Caves, the 
Mountains of Peril, as well as several other locations.  She is 
constantly on the move and contacting her for the first time has be 
known to be quite a chore.
	Neither side trusts her much, in fact, there is a rumor among the 
freedom fighters that she had helped Robotnik steal the Robotizizer plans 
form Sir Charles Hedghog's database.  This rumor has yet to be proven.

I am very impressed with the Princess Sally solo stories (Sonics
#17,18; InYourFace special; & Princess Sally mini series)!  The
pencils of Art Mawhinney captures the beauty and personality
of our favorite lady brilliantly!  Bravo!  I urge everyone who likes the
new series to write Archie Comics and thank them!  I'd E-mail them
monthly if I had their address (anyone know it?)

I hope this is a sign that the Sonic comics are evolving from the 
slapstick humour (don't get me wrong, slapstick is great, but some
how I think it doesn't seem to fit Sonic's universe) and the hybrid-schizoid
mix of syndicated and ABC styles.  It makes the mind reel!  If enough people
support it I think it will be here to stay!

To a Free Mobius!
Long Live Princess Sally!
(and Art Mawhinney!)

Sonic the Hedgehog:  Ill Will 
by David Pistone

	It was raining.  It had been raining hard for several days, and
there was no sign that it would let up any time soon.  Deep in the Great
Forest at Knothole Village, there was little or no activity.  Most of the
creatures stayed indoors and out of the rain.  Tails lay in bed.  The
coldness and dampness had gotten him a small cold.  Consequently, he was
under Sally's orders to stay in bed and rest.  Fortunately, he seemed to
be getting better, and soon he would be well again.
	Deep in Robotnik's territory, at the capital of Robotropolis, all
operations had slowed to a crawl.  Due to some crafty sabotage on the part
of the Freedom Fighters, Robotnik's main rain shields were disabled and
much of his city was shut down.  At the main control center in the middle
of the city, Dr. Robotnik sat in his large chair gazing at the status
screens on the wall.  What he saw was not good.  If something wasn't done
soon, the entire city would be completely malfunctioning.  As he sat
watching the screens, a short, nervous looking man entered the room.
	"Dr. Robotnik," he said.
	Robotnik's chair turned around so he could face the small man.
	"Report, Snively," said Robotnik
	"The repairs on the rain shield are nearly completed," said Snively
"We should have them fixed within the hour."
	"Excellent," replied Robotnik "How long before Robotropolis is up
and running?"
	"We should be back to full operational status within three days."
	Robotnik turned back to the screens and was silent for some time
before continuing. 
	"Tell me again Snively," he said "How is it that Sonic was able to
disable our shields?"
	Snively shuffled his feet nervously.
	"Didn't you say something about weak security?" said Robotnik in a
strangely calm voice.
	"Yes sir," replied Snively.
	"There must be some way to neutralize that pesky hedgehog!" said
Robotnik.
	"If I may offer a suggestion sir," said Snively as he walked over
to the main control panels.  He typed in a few commands and the pictures
of two individuals appeared on the screen, Princess Sally and Tails.
	"Unlike us," said Snively "the hedgehog has people that he cares
for.  If we could get our hands on either of them, we could use them to
keep the hedgehog at bay."
	Robotnik was not impressed.
	"Tell me Snively," said Robotnik "how do you propose to do that? 
Princess Sally is not easily caught off guard when she comes here to
sabotage my city, and the small fox hasn't even been seen outside The
Great Forest."
	"We could send spies into the Great Forest and catch them when and
where they least suspect."
	Robotnik thought about this for a moment.  Then, an evil smile
came across his face.
	"Excellent!" he exclaimed "Dispatch the Stealth-bots immediately!" 
	Back at Knothole Village, the rain was beginning to subside. 
Tails, who had been feeling better as of late, was sitting in bed trying
to convince Sally to let him go out and play. 
	"I feel fine Sally," Tails was saying "honest." 
	Sally, who was sitting beside his bed wasn't buying it. 
	"You may only think you're feeling better," she said "but you
haven't fully recovered." 
	"Yes I have," said Tails. 
	Sally thought for a moment. 
	"All right," she said "If you feel as good tomorrow morning, then
you can go outside." 
	Tails hugged her "Thank you Aunt Sally!" he exclaimed. 
	"Now I think you better get some more rest," she said "If you're
going to be well enough to go out tomorrow, you'll need rest." 
	Tails laid down and closed his eyes.  Within minutes, he was
sleeping peacefully. 
	Sally got up carefully and left the room.  As she walked down the
hall, she met Sonic who was going to see Tails. 
	"How's the big guy doing?" he asked. 
	"He's feeling better," Sally said "He thinks he's well enough to go
outside, but I told him to wait until tomorrow.  He's sleeping right now
so don't bother him." 
	"All right," replied Sonic "I'm sure he'll be all right tomorrow." 

	As Sonic was speaking, three Stealth-bots, Robotnik's silent
robotic aircraft, were cruising at a low altitude over The Great Forest
scanning for Tails and Sally. 

	The next morning, as Tails thought, he was feeling better, and
Sally gave her grudging permission for him to go outside.  As she watched
Tails run out into the surrounding forest, Bunny Rabbot came up beside
her. 
	"Do you think he'll be all right?" Bunny asked. 
	"I hope so," replied Sally "Still, I think I'll ask Sonic to keep
an eye on him today." 
	"That would be a good idea," Bunny said "In fact, there he is now." 
	Sonic was walking toward them while talking with Rotor. 
	"Hey, Sonic," Sally called. 
	"Good morning ladies," replied Sonic. 
	"Good morning," replied Rotor. 
	"Sonic," said Sally "could you do me a favor and watch Tails today
and make sure he's all right." 
	"Sure thing," answered Sonic. 
	"Good," said Sally "If his cold acts up again, I'd like someone
watching him." 
	Suddenly, a scream split the air.  All present recognized Tails'
voice screaming for help.  Immediately, they rushed off to the direction
of the screams.  They soon arrived at a clearing where they saw a
Stealth-bot carrying off Tails in one of it's robotic arms.  Sonic was the
first to race after it, and the others followed.  Suddenly, another
Stealth-bot swooped down from the sky toward the group, dividing them in
all directions.  Meanwhile, Sonic, who had been racing after the first
Stealth-bot, was almost in range of jumping up and catching the
Stealth-bot.  However, he wasn't looking where he was going and crashed
into a tree. 
	Back at the clearing Bunny, Rotor, and Sally were trying to
regroup and retreat, but, before anyone knew what happened, a Stealth-bot
sped down out of the air and caught Sally in it's robotic arm.  Sally
struggled to get free, but the Stealth-bot was to strong.  All of the
Stealth-bots, with Tails and Sally in their custody, sped back to
Robotropolis with all speed. 
	Bunny and Rotor caught up to where Sonic was recovering with his
encounter with a tree.  Sonic was sitting next to the tree holding his
head.  He looked up as the others approached and asked them what happened. 
	"The Stealth-bots got Tails and Sally!" exclaimed Rotor "They've
taken them back to Robotropolis." 
	Sonic jumped up in alarm and made ready to race after them, but
Rotor held him back. 
	"You know you can't go to Robotropolis," said Rotor. 
	"And why not?" snapped Sonic "They just ran off with two of our
best friends!" 
	"You need a power ring first," answered Bunny. 
	Sonic knew she was right, but he still grumbled about it as they
walked back to Knothole to break the news to the rest of the Freedom
Fighters. 

	Dr. Ivo Robotnik was sitting in his big chair in the main command
center looking quite pleased with himself.  Snively had just brought him
the news that Tails and Sally had been captured and had just arrived at
Robotropolis.  He was looking out the window at what he called a
wonderfully polluted city. He was trying to think of all the ways he would
be able to control Sonic now that two of Sonic's friends were now in his
possession.  The door to the command room opened.  Robotnik turned to face
who he knew was coming. 
	Sally and Tails were being carried into the control room.  Each
one was in the tight grip of a Swat-bot.  Tails was near petrified with
fear.  Sally, who usually kept a cool head, was looking about her to try
to find a way to escape.  As soon as she saw Robotnik, she did not
hesitate to protest. 
	"You'll never get away with this Robotnik!" she exclaimed "If you
think for one instant that whatever plan you have will work, you are
sorely mistaken!" 
	"I think not my dear girl," Robotnik said "This time, I shall see
to it that Sonic never finds you.  Surely you know that, as long as I have
you two as prisoners, Sonic will have to do everything I say." 
	"The least you could do is let him go," said Sally, indicating
Tails "He's just a child!" 
	"All the more reason for me to keep him," said Robotnik as he
walked over to the petrified Tails and patted him on the head "I know how
much this young one's life means to Sonic." 
	"If you hurt that fox," Sally warned "so help me I'll see to it
that you severely regret it!" 
	Robotnik turned towards Sally. 
	"You are hardly in a position to make threats of any kind." 
	He looked up at the Swat-bots. 
	"Take these two to the transport shuttle," ordered Robotnik "I'll
be there shortly." 
	The two Swat-bots carried Sally and Tails from the room.  As they
were leaving, Sally heard Robotnik say "We'll see what some time in
Ironlock prison does to them." 
	Robotnik's mad laughter could be heard throughout the entire
building. 

	The Power Ring were probably the most unusual thing to be
invented.  Sonic's uncle, Professor Charles Hedgehog, had developed the
technology shortly before Robotnik's invasion.  A few months before the
invasion, Charles placed a device that automatically constructed power
rings at the bottom of a small, deep pool of water near Knothole Village. 
	Sonic was now pacing back and forth next to that same pool,
waiting for a ring.  Ring construction was extensive and the device could
only turn out one ring every eight to twelve hours.  Strangely enough
Sonic was the only creature that could use the power in a ring.  When he
held one, he was able to run at just over Mach one.  Normally his top
running speed was only two hundred and fifty MPH. 
	The pool suddenly started to glow. Sonic stopped pacing and
waited.  A large glowing ring levitated up out of the pool and hung in mid
air.  Sonic grabbed it quickly.  He could feel it's immense power rushing
through him.  Not one to waste time, he quickly charged off to
Robotropolis.  He exceeded Mach one in less than ten seconds. 
	Sonic arrived at Robotropolis in three minutes, and forty-five
seconds.  Sneaking into the prison block was not going to be easy.  Sonic
stealthily sneaked through the city.  As he approached the prison block,
he heard a shuttle taking off and looked up.  A large subtle was taking
off from the main control center.  Sonic dismissed it as another transport
ship off to mind it's own business.  Sonic continued his search for Sally
and Tails.  The shuttle coasted through the air. 

	On board the shuttle, Robotnik was gloating to Snively about how
well his plan was succeeding.  In the back of the shuttle was a small cell
in which was Sally and Tails.  Tails was beginning to come out of his
fearful trance and was now trembling uncontrollably.  Sally held him close
to her, trying to comfort him.  After a time, he slowly calmed down and
stopped trembling.  Sally found that he had fallen asleep.  Sally
carefully laid him down on the bench she was sitting on and rested his
head on her leg.  As she sat there listening to the soft roar of the
shuttle engines, she wondered how Robotnik could be cruel enough to make a
child go through this.  She looked down at Tails and saw him cough in his
sleep.  She dismissed it as the result of all the pollution in the air,
but something in the back of here mind vaguely suggested that it might be
something more. 
	The shuttle continued its journey toward Ironlock Prison. 

	Back at Knothole Village, Sonic had just come back from
Robotropolis.  He was quite upset that he hadn't found any sign of Sally
or Tails.  Sonic decided that his next move should be to go ask Bookshire
if he knew where the pair might be. 

	Bookshire was an unusual person.  He lived near the northern most
edge of Knothole Village.  His main interests were in computer and medical
technology.  The thing that made him such an asset to the rebellion
against Robotnik was that he had established a link between his computer
and the Robotropolis Main Computer Core.  This provided much information
about almost any aspect of Robotnik's operations.  Sonic, along with Bunny
and Rotor arrived shortly at Bookshire's residence.  The middle-aged
raccoon welcomed them and asked what he could do for them. 
	"Sally and Tails have been kidnapped by Robotnik," said Sonic "We
want you to find out where he's taken them." 
	"Come in then," said Bookshire "I'll see what I can do. 
	He led the three down into his home which he had constructed just
under the surface.  They went into his computer room where Bookshire sat
down in front of the computer and turned it on.  After some initial button
pushing, Bookshire switched the computer into voice activation mode so he
could speak directly to it. 
	"Computer," he said "access Robotropolis Main Computer Core using
Cryptosmasher software." 
	The computer contacted the RMCC and quickly broke through the
encryption security lockouts.  It then displayed The RMCC main menu of
operations. 
	"Computer, determine security level for information regarding the
location of prisoners." 
	"Access to Robotropolis Prisoner Status Files requires Level One
Priority Clearance," said the computer. 
	"Can such clearance be forged through the use of any code-breaking
software in your memory?" asked Bookshire. 
	"Affirmative," replied the computer "with a probability of being
discovered of sixty-eight percent." 
	"What does that mean?" asked Bunny. 
	"It means that we need to fake and access code to get into these
files," said Bookshire "and there's a sixty-eight percent chance that
Robotnik's security programs will catch us and lock up the system." 
	"Well I think that that's a risk we have to take," said Sonic. 
	"You're right," said Bookshire "Computer, attempt access of said
files.  Upon access, search for information regarding Princess Sally and
Tails." 
	The computer screen was suddenly filled with incomprehensible data
as the computer attempted access.  Shortly, the main menu for the prisoner
status files appeared.  The computer then searched for the requested
information. 
	"There are no files on record for Princess Sally or Tails," said
the computer. 
	"Great," said Sonic, annoyed "What do we do now?" 
	"Well," said Bookshire "apparently they're not being kept in
Robotropolis.  What we have to do now is figure out where they could have
been taken." 
	"And how are we supposed to do that?" asked Rotor. 
	Bookshire thought for a moment. 
	"Computer," he said "exit Prisoner Status Files and access records
for all transports departing Robotropolis in the last twenty-four hours." 
	The computer quickly carried out the command. 
	"There have been 297 recorded departures from Robotropolis." 
	"Which transports were transporting prisoners?" asked Bookshire
	"No transports were reported with prisoners." 
	"That would make sense," remarked Bookshire "I guess Robotnik
didn't want anyone to know where they were taken." 
	Suddenly, Sonic got an idea. 
	"Maybe we could find out if any of the transports were destined for
other prisons," he said. 
	"Great idea!" exclaimed Bookshire "Computer, how many of the
previously mentioned transports were destined for any known prison?" 
	"Transport NO. 14578-K5-78598-B departed Robotropolis Main Control
Center at 1100 hours today. Reported destination:  Ironlock Prison, Pilot: 
Swat-Bot #457-S, Passengers:  3.S
	"Ironlock Prison!" exclaimed everyone. 
	"Well," said Bookshire "Now you know where they are.  Perhaps it
would be in everyone's best interests if you were to go get them.  Now!" 
	This broke the others from their stunned trance.  They thanked
Bookshire and immediately raced off to Ironlock prison. 

	Ironlock Prison was one of the oldest structures on the planet. 
It had been built in 1593 near the very heart of the Dark Swamp.  It was
used for over 300 years until it was abandoned in 1894.  Now, the old
building was crumbling, but there were still some parts that were still
intact.  One of these parts was a small cell block on the fifth level that
was, at that moment, being guarded by ten Swat-bots.  In one of the cells
was Princess Sally and Tails. 
	Tails was lying, trembling on what was left of the bed.  He was
getting sick again.  Sally had done just about all she could think of to
comfort him.  She had covered him with an old blanket she found in the
cell, but it was getting colder and colder as night started to set in. 
Being unable to think of much else to do, she sat down next to him and
started singing something soothing.  She had been singing to Tails for
some time before she was interrupted when she noticed Robotnik standing at
the bars. 
	"What a lovely singing voice you have Princess," remarked Robotnik,
smiling "Perhaps you would be good enough to sing for me once." 
	Sally was appalled at the mere thought. 
	"In your dreams, Doctor," snapped Sally. 
	"Too bad," replied Robotnik "I just stopped by to see if you are
enjoying your new home." 
	"I'd rather see you behind bars Robotnik," said Sally "How can you
be so cruel as to lock up a sick child!" 
	Robotnik smiled. 
	"Just another part of my wonderful personality I guess," he said. 
	"When Sonic finds us, he'll make you regret the day you were born!" 
exclaimed Sally. 
	"I think not my dear girl," said Robotnik "He has no idea where you
are, and even if he did, my Swat-bots will handle him.  In the meantime,
enjoy your stay." 
	Robotnik chuckled to himself as he walked away. Sally turned back
to the sleeping fox and felt his forehead.  It was extremely hot.  Sally
was getting more and more worried that, if help didn't come soon, it would
come too late.  She began to sing to Tails again as night fell into place. 

	Sonic, Bunny, and Rotor arrived outside the main gate of Ironlock
Prison shortly after eight o'clock.  It wasn't going to be easy getting in
there.  Carefully secluded behind some trees, the three planned their next
move. 
	"There are four Swat-bots guarding the main gate," said Bunny "How
are we going to get past them?" 
	"Maybe we won't have to," said Rotor "If any of the stories I've
heard about this place are true, there are at least three secret entrances
to this place." 
	The trio moved silently through the surrounding swamp until they
arrive at a small pond. 
	"I think there should be a tunnel into the prison at the bottom of
this pond," said Rotor. 
	"I'll go down and have a look," replied Sonic. 
	Sonic dove into the murky water.  Although he could barely see, he
was able to make out a dark tunnel near the bottom.  He swam back to the
surface. 
	"I found it," he told the others "let's go." 
	Bunny and Rotor dove in and followed Sonic down through the water
and into the tunnel.  Just as they were about to run out of air, they
surfaced in a dark cavern.  As they climbed out of the water Rotor pulled
out his flashlight. 
	"I don't think any living thing has been in here for ages," 
remarked Bunny. 
	"You're probably right," said Sonic "Let's get going." 
	The three proceeded down the dark cavern.  It was some time before
the cavern opened out into an abandoned corridor somewhere deep inside
Ironlock. 
	Rotor pulled out a scanner he had brought with him and swept the
area. 
	"I think I have something," he said "I'm reading two life forms
about five floors above and to the northwest of us." 
	"Then let's get going," said Sonic impatiently. 
	The three moved up the prison as fast as they could go.  When they
reached the fifth level, it was crawling with Swat-bots.  They moved
silently down a corridor and peeked around the corner.  One of the cells
down the next corridor was guarded by a bunch of Swat-bots. 
	"That's gotta be where they are," whispered Sonic "you guys wait
here, and I'll handle the Swat-bots." 
	Sonic raced out of hiding, and, before the Swat-bots could react,
he leaped into a Sonic-spin and tore through each and every one of them. 
When he finished they were nothing more than piles of metal.  Rotor and
Bunny came out of hiding as Sonic opened the cell door. 
	"Sonic!" exclaimed Sally "Am I ever glad to see you.  Tails got
sick again and its even worse than before! We've got to get him out of
here!" 
	Bunny came in a gently picked up the still trembling fox in her
arms. 
	"Alright," said Sonic "we gotta find a quick way out of here." 
	I think I saw a patrol craft in the courtyard as we came up," 
said Rotor. 
	"Great, "said Sally "If it's still there then we're in business." 
	They ran down to the courtyard as fast as they could.  As they ran
out into the yard, a loud alarm sounded.  The were momentarily startled,
but they quickly snapped out of it as the yard began to fill with
Swat-bots.  Sonic ran ahead and destroyed the two bots guarding the craft. 
the group barely made it inside when the bots opened fire on the craft. 
	Bunny laid Tails down on one of the benches as Rotor began to try
the controls. 
	"You do know how to fly one of these don't you, Rotor," asked
Sally. 
	"Uh...I think so," said Rotor as he flipped various switches. 
	"HEDGEHOG!" bellowed a deep voice from somewhere outside. 
	"You'd do extremely well to surrender now, hedgehog," said Robotnik
"we have you completely surrounded." 
	"In your dreams, Robuttnik!" yelled back Sonic. 
	Just then, Rotor hit the vertical thrusters and the craft shot
straight up for over a mile.  Suddenly it stopped. 
	"Well," said Rotor, visibly shaken "I think I got it." 

	The trip home was somewhat shaky, but everyone survived.  After an
examination, Bookshire reported that they got Tails home in time and he
would be okay.  Three weeks later, Tails and Sally were back having the
same conversation.
	"I feel fine Sally," Tails was saying "honest."
	Sally, who was sitting beside his bed wasn't buying it.
	"You may only think you're feeling better," she said "but you
haven't fully recovered."
	"Yes I have," said Tails.
	Sally thought for a moment.
	"Not this time, Tails," said Sally "Now I think you should get some
sleep."
	"Aw, Aunt Sally, "began Tails.
	"Come on, Tails" said Sonic from the doorway " if you go to sleep
now, when you're well, you can go on a race with me through the forest."
	Tails didn't need a second invitation.  He laid down in his bed
and went to sleep.
	After Sally and Sonic had left the room, Sally turned to him. 
	"You definitely seem to have a way with children," said Sally.
	"Yeah, I understand children real well," Sonic boasted.
	"Takes one to know one, right," said Sally. 
	"Right," said Sonic"...hey, wait a minute!"
	Sally burst out laughing. 
	"That's not funny, Sal," said Sonic. 
	"Sure it is," replied Sally.
	Sonic was about to say something else, but he started laughing
too.
	The pair walked through Knothole playfully making fun of each
other as night once again closed in on the Great Forest.

To rotor. It would be a good Idea to post them here. I, myself only have e-mail
and usenet groups and can not get to your other storys. Please post them here.
I would (As I think most everyone else as well,) like to read the other storys.

	on characters created by Archie Comic Publications

	NOTE:  Tails does not appear in this story because,
	according to the way I wrote history, Tails had not joined
	the freedom fighters at this point.

	Night had settled over The Great Forest.  Most creatures were asleep 
and dreaming various dreams.  The inhabitants of Knothole Village were no 
exception.  Every freedom fighter was in bed sleeping peacefully, except for 
Bookshire.
	Sitting in front of his computer, Bookshire sat back and groaned.  
For the last two months he had been trying every trick in the book and then 
some in order to access the Robotropolis Main Computer Core and he hadn't 
been having any luck whatsoever.
	Bookshire looked at the computer screen and rubbed his eyes.  It 
was filled with complex mathematical calculations and at the bottom it said 
"ACCESS DENIED".  Very early on in the project Bookshire had discovered that 
all outside links to the RMCC were protected by complicated data encryption 
algorithms.  
	"This is ridiculous," he said to no one in particular "At this rate 
I'll never crack the access code."
	He sat back and thought for a moment.
	"What I need is a direct terminal."
	Of course, that meant actually going into Robotropolis and using one 
of the many workstations located throughout the city.  Cracking the entry 
code for one of the stations wouldn't be a problem, but getting caught would 
be, and, with his bad leg, he wouldn't get far if he was discovered.
	"Oh well," he said as he turned off the computer "maybe one day..."
	He turned out the lights and went to bed.

	The morning found the freedom fighters going about their business as 
usual.  Rotor was sitting at a table next to his hut with both a pitcher and 
a mug of hot chocolate and a small pile of papers that he was looking over.  
He looked up for a moment to take a sip from his mug when he saw Bookshire 
limping by with cane in hand looking rather depressed.
	"Hey, Bookshire," called Rotor.
	Bookshire looked up.
	"Oh, hi Rotor," he said
	"Would you like some hot chocolate?" Rotor asked.
	"Sure," said Bookshire as he walked over.
	Rotor poured another mug as Bookshire sat down opposite him.
	"So," said Rotor "Is something bothering you?"
	"I guess you could say that," said Bookshire "I've been working on 
trying to break into Robotnik's main computer for the last two months and I 
haven't been having any luck at all.  It wouldn't be so hard if I had access 
to a direct terminal, but the only ones are in Robotropolis."
	"Yes," replied Rotor "I can see how that would be a problem."
	The two sat in silence for a moment or two before Rotor spoke again.
	"I have an idea," he said "why don't we send someone into 
Robotropolis to try to break in for you."
	"I doubt it would work," said Bookshire "so far as I know I'm the 
only one in the Village that can't even begin to try to decode Robotnik's 
computer network."
	"We wouldn't need a computer expert," replied Rotor "wait here a 
moment."
	Rotor went back into his hut and emerged a few minutes later 
carrying a small, flat box which he set down in front of Bookshire.
	"What is it?" asked Bookshire.
	"Its a mini computer and long range communications set," said Rotor 
"All we would have to do is have someone use the computer to tap into the 
mainframe while you give them directions through the comm. link from here."
	"Yeah, that might just work," said Bookshire brightening up 
considerably "why don't we go see what Sally thinks about it."
	The two finished their hot chocolate and went over to Princess 
Sally's hut.  Sally liked the idea and, soon, Sonic and Sally were headed 
toward Robotropolis, while Rotor, Bookshire, and Bunnie sat down in front 
of Bookshire's computer and waited.  

	Deep in Robotropolis, Robotnik was standing by a window, gazing out 
at the city when Snively entered.
	"Did you trace it?" asked Robotnik without turning.
	"Well...no, sir," replied Snively "we traced the transmission to a 
relay station just north of here and then we lost it."
	"I trust, Snively, that you are doing everything in your power to 
trace this transmission," said Robotnik, his temper rising "I will not have 
rebel freedom fighters breaking into my system!"
	Snively just stood there unable to think of anything to say.
	After a moment, Robotnik calmed down.
	"Did you send for Commander Packbell?" he asked.
	"Yes, sir," replied Snively "He should be arriving within the hour, 
sir."
	"Actually, I should be arriving now."
	Snively was grabbed from behind and tossed to one side and a cloaked 
figure entered the room.  Robotnik turned away from the window to face him.
	"Well, well, well," he said "Commander Packbell, and how is my 
favorite android today?"
	"I'm your only android, sir," Packbell replied. 
	"Packbell, I have a new assignment for you," said Robotnik "Someone 
on the outside has been trying to break into the computer system.  You're 
job is to track them down."
	"That's it?" asked Packbell.
	"Yes," replied Robotnik.
	"Hum, somehow I expected something challenging from you, sir," said 
Packbell.
	"Just do it!" snapped Robotnik.
	"Very well," answered Packbell.
	He turned to leave. As he walked toward the door he grabbed Snively, 
who was in his way again, and tossed him over his shoulder.        
	"Excuse me, please," said Packbell as he passed by.

	In another part of the city Sonic and Sally had managed to make it 
into an abandoned service crawl way.  After a few minutes, the two emerged 
into and empty room with a workstation in it.     
	"Well," said Sonic "we're here.  So, what now?"
	"Just stand and watch," said Sally.  She went over to the workstation 
and opened Rotor's computer. 
	"Stand and watch?!," said Sonic in disbelief "I can't just stand!"
	"Try to have some patience," said Sally.
	"Hey, patients are for hospitals.  We're in Robo-country, and that 
makes me edgy," replied Sonic.
	Sally sighed as she began to make the connection to Knothole.
	
	Meanwhile, back in Knothole, Bookshire, Rotor, and Bunnie were still 
waiting for Sally's signal.
	"Tell me again," said Bunnie "How is it that you can get into Robo's 
computer without being traced?"
	"It's rather simple really," explained Bookshire "My computer has a 
random signal path generator.  Every time I send a signal to the system it 
gets routed though a completely random selection of relay stations and 
satilites throughout the planet.  Since the path keeps changing with each 
signal it's impossible to trace."
	Suddenly the speaker crackled to life.
	"Knothole, this is Sally, over"
	"This is Knothole," replied Bookshire "we read you loud and clear."
	"I've located a workstation and I've hooked your computer into it," 
reported Sally.
	"Excellent," said Bookshire.    
	Bookshire leaned forward and turned on his monitor.
	"Sally," said Rotor "on the computer is a button marked "screen 
transmit", push it."
	Suddenly, Bookshire's monitor laid out a menu of options.  At the top 
of the screen it said:  ROBOTROPOLIS MAIN COMPUTER CORE ACCESS STATION 
#1245-B.
	"Wonderful," said Bookshire "now all we have to do is fine out what 
the code is for getting in from the outside."       
	"Well," said Sally "I suggest that we start with system security.  
I'm logging in with Rotor's cryptosmasher software."
	Getting in was surprisingly easy and, soon, they believed that they 
had found what they were looking for.
	"I think I have something," said Sally "It's a code labeled 
'global access'."
	"Yes," said Bookshire "I see it.  I think that that's it.  Hang on 
one moment."
	Bookshire pulled out a blank optical disc and placed it into his 
optical recorder and hit the record button.
	"Okay, Sally," said Bookshire "transmit the file."
	"Transmitting..."
	The screen filled up with incomprehensible data all of which they 
now had on disc.
	"Great," said Rotor "that should do it, so disconnect and come home."
	"You got it," said Sally "we're on our way."
	
	"Finally," said Sonic impatiently.
	"Oh, come on," said Sally as she disconnected the computer "it wasn't 
that bad."
	"Wasn't bad!  My legs fell asleep!" exclaimed Sonic.
	"Well wake them up," she said "we've got to go."
	Sonic and Sally tore out of Robotopolis as fast as they could.

	When they arrived back at Knothole they immediately went down to 
Bookshire computer room.
	"Did it work?" asked Sally as they entered.
	"You bet it did," replied Bunnie "that ol' genius has a direct link 
into the system."
	"Excellent," replied Sally.
	"Now we should be able to get any info on what ever we need," said 
Bookshire.
	Rotor yawned.
	"Well," he said "I think that it should wait until morning."
	The others agreed and they left to go back to their huts.  Bookshire 
stayed at the terminal and looked through a few files.  Interesting, he 
thought to himself.  He turned off the computer and went to bed.

	"What do you mean you lost it!" exclaimed Packbell.
	The Swat-bot turned from the computer to face him.
	"The signal was traced to a relay station in the Great Swamp and 
then it was terminated," it reported.
	Packbell grumbled in suppressed anger.  He walked over to the wall 
where there was a rack of laser rifles.
	"You know I don't like failure," he said.
	Quickly removing a rifle from its place, he turned and blasted the 
bot out of its seat.  Replacing the rifle, he walked over to the comm. panel.
	"Bot Distribution, could you send me another Swat-bot.  The other 
one displeased me."
	"Acknowledged," came the reply.
	Packbell turned towards the computer.
	"I swear, when I find the rebels that are doing this, they're going 
to be on their knees begging me to robotize them."

	The next morning, Bookshire was back again in front of the terminal, 
examining Robotnik's system.  At one point, he came across a directory 
labeled, "CURRENT OFFENSIVE PROJECTS".  As he began to read through the 
terrible ideas that Robotnik was devising to eliminate the freedom fighters, 
he came across a recent entry that stated that an intense acid rain factory 
would be on-line in less than one day.  After reading enough of the entry, 
he leaped out of his chair and ran to warn the freedom fighters.

	"I knew that terminal would come in handy," said Sally.
	Sally, Bunnie, and Sonic were crouched near a junk heap on the 
outskirts of Robotropolis.
	"So, what's the plan Sally girl?" asked Bunnie.
	"You and I are going to break into the control room and disable the 
security devices while Sonic plants the explosives to destroy the factory."
	The three freedom fighters made their way toward the factory.  They 
split up just outside the factory.
	"Good luck you two," said Sonic " as he raced off.
	For some reason, Sally and Bunnie found it surprisingly easy to get 
inside the factory.  While carefully avoiding the security devices, the two 
made their way to the control room.  When they arrived, they were somewhat 
surprised to find that there weren't any bots manning it.
	"That's odd," Sally remarked as she began to look for the security 
override switches "We shouldn't have gotten in here this easily."
	"Do you think it's a trap?" asked Bunnie.
	"I'm not sure," Sally replied.  
	"I found the security switches," said Bunnie.
	"Excellent," said Sally.  She examined the switches and panels.
	"Wait a minute," she said "According to this display, there's more 
than one set of security overrides.  The two sets have to be deactivated at 
the same time."
	"So," said Bunnie "Where's the other set?"
	"It's on the other side of the factory," Sally replied.  She handed 
Bunnie a comm. link "Take this.  I'll go over to the other set and we'll 
shut them off at the same time."
	"I'll be waiting," said Bunnie "Good luck."
	"You too," said Sally as she walked out of the room.
	After a few minutes, Bunnie examined the panels again.  She knew a 
bit about computers, not as much as Sally or Bookshire, but the knowledge 
she did have had been helpful in the rebellion.  As she began to look at 
one of the panels, the door to the room slammed shut. She turned in alarm as 
a previously unnoticed door slid open and a dozen Swat-bots came in.
	"FREEZE PRISONER," declared the leader.  Each bot had a laser rifle 
aimed directly at her.  Bunnie froze where she was, too startled by their 
sudden appearance to react in any other way.
	
	Sally made it to the extra set of overrides and turned on her 
comm. link.
	"Bunnie, this is Sally, do you read," she said.
	No answer,
	"Bunnie?" she asked again, slightly alarmed.
	Still no answer.
	She ran back to the other room to find it completely abandoned.

	A transport docked at the main prison block on the other side of 
Robotropolis.  A group of Swat-bots escorted their prisoner into a large 
meeting room where Commander Packbell was eagerly waiting.
	"Well, well, well," he remarked as Bunnie was escorted in "whom do 
	we have here?"       
	He walked up to her and glared. 
	"You know, I may not have been able to trace that transmission, but 
the false info about the acid rain factory did the job equally well," he said 
"Only a group of freedom fighters that had access to the system could have 
known it was there.  You shall be an example to the rest of the rebellion.  
I'll show all of them what can happen when they try to break into Robotnik's 
computer system.  First however, if you are willing to tell me about your 
friends and how they broke in, I might go easy on you."
	"In your dreams, commander," Bunnie replied.    
	"Oh well," said Packbell.  He signalled to the bots. 
	"We'll see what some of my devices do to change your mind."
	The Swat-bots escorted her from the room.

	Soon, Bunnie was beginning to wish she hadn't come on this mission.  
Packbell had strapped her into a machine that delivers controlled bursts 
of intense electricity to the victim.  Bunnie was only half conscious and 
her breathing was short and shallow.
	"Still not talking, huh," said Packbell "Oh well.  It looks like 
I'm not going to get anywhere with you."
	He turned to one of the Swat-bots.
	"Revive her fully and take her to the robotizizer," he said "I'll 
be there shortly."
	
	Meanwhile, Sally had located Sonic and told him that Bunnie had 
most likely been captured.  They decided that Sally would wait there while 
Sonic charged off towards the prison block.

	Bunnie had been encased in the giant glass cylinder in the massive 
robotizizer.
	"During these last few moments of your natural life, I might be 
convinced to stop the procedure if only you would tell me what I want to 
know," Packbell was saying.
	"Then I guess that's the end of my natural life," said Bunnie 
defiantly "I'm taking their secrets with me."
	"Very well," said Packbell.
	He turned to the control bot.   
	"Is this thing charged yet?" he asked.
	"Five minutes to full operational charge," the bot reported.
	Suddenly the comm. panel sprang to life.
	"Urgent!  Commander Packbell, report to the dragon robotizizer 
immediately.  Prisoner escape attempt under way."
	 "Well," he said to Bunnie "As much as I hate missing a rebel 
robotization, I hate missing a dragon more."
	He turned to the bot.
	"Take over.  Use standard procedures," he said.
	As he walked from the room, Bunnie called after him.
	"You may get me, and you may get a hundred more, but one day the 
freedom fighters are going to beat Robotnik!"
	Packbell paused at the door and said "I doubt that."
	Then, under his breath he said "because I'll get to him first."
	Suddenly, the machine indicated that it was ready to begin.  The 
bot turned it on.

	Bunnie was enveloped in a yellow beam of energy.  A sudden pain 
shot through her as the machine began to alter her body on the molecular 
level.  The feelings and sensations moving through her body were intense.  
After a few moments she passed out.

	Then, without warning, Sonic the Hedgehog shot into the room and 
slammed into the control bot, tearing it to peaces.  He shut off the 
robotizizer as fast as he could.  Running over to the cylinder, he opened 
it.  Bunnie's limp form fell out onto the floor.  Sonic gasped in shock.  
Her legs and left arm had been completely transformed into robotic limbs.  
After he recovered from the shock, he examined her.  She was still breathing, 
but her pulse was weak.  He picked her up and ran from the room.  After 
meeting Sally at the outskirts of the city, they raced back to Knothole at 
top speed.

	Bunnie lay still as death in her bed.  The only indications that she 
was still alive were the soft beeps of Rotor's pulse monitor and Bookshire's 
brain wave scanner.
	"Is she going to be alright?" Sally finally asked.
	Rotor and Bookshire looked up from the numerous books they were 
reading.
	"We don't know," Rotor admitted.
	"There isn't anything in any of these books on a person being 
partially robotizized," said Bookshire.
	"This is totally new stuff," said Rotor "Bunnie is the planet's 
first cybernetic life form, possessing both organic and artificial parts.  
No one knows how to deal with such a concept."
	Can't you at least give me a best and worst case scenario?" pressed 
Sally.
	The two hesitated for a moment.
	"Well," began Bookshire "the worst that could happen is her brain 
never recovers from the shock, the brain waves break down, and she dies."
	"Or," continued Rotor "the best that could happen is her body makes 
the adjustments and she fully recovers.  Of course, any of a hundred of 
things in between those two could happen."
	"Well," said Sally "let me know if her condition changes."
	"You can count on it," said Bookshire.
	Sally left and went for a walk.
	
	As she walked down by the power ring pool, she saw Sonic sitting 
by himself on a log.  She walked up and sat down next to him.
	"How are you?" she asked.
	Sonic looked up as if noticing her for the first time.
	"Okay I guess," he replied.
	"What's wrong?" Sally asked, her voice filled with concern.
	Sonic sat there without answering.
	"Come on, Sonic.  You know you can talk to me," she continued.
	"I was too slow," answered Sonic, quietly.
	"What?"
	"I wasn't fast enough to save her," he continued.
	"Sonic, it wasn't your fault," she said.        
	"Yes it was," Sonic insisted "If only I had been faster."
	"Look, I know no one blames you for what happened," said Sally.
	"How do you know Bunnie won't," said Sonic.
	"If anything Bunnie will probably be thankful that you saved her at 
all," Sally said "If it hadn't been for you, she'd be getting shipped off 
to some factory by now."
	"Maybe you're right, "admitted Sonic "but I'll have to think about 
it for a while."
	"I understand," Sally said.  she stood up and left him to his 
thoughts.

	After she finished her walk, Sally returned to Bunnie's hut where 
a surprising site met her eyes.  Bunnie was conscious and crying into 
Bookshire's arms.
	"She regained consciousness a few minutes ago," explained Rotor 
"When we broke the news to her she burst out in tears."
	After a few minutes, Bunnie calmed down a little and laid back in 
bed.  Sally sat down next to the bed.
	"It's not as bad as you think," said Bookshire.
	"And how's that?" demanded Bunnie "Look at me!  I'm a freak!"
	"No you're not," said Sally.
	"Then what would you call me," Bunnie insisted.
	The three hesitated for a moment.
	"You're just who you always have been," said Sally "a kind, loving 
creature who's dedicated, smart, and great to be around.  You may have 
changed physically, but you're still the same person we all know, and love."
	"It will take time for you to adjust to those changes," said Rotor 
"but it can happen.  You'll be back to your old self in no time."
	"Perhaps," said Bunnie.
	
	One month later, Bunnie had progressed at a surprising pace, and 
she was learning to use her new arm and legs to her advantage.  Bookshire, 
Rotor, and Bunnie were thrilled as were the rest of the freedom fighters.  
Bunnie was thrilled that she was getting back to normal and that her name 
would be recorded in history as the first cybernetic life form, and Rotor 
and Bookshire were thrilled because they would be known for perfecting 
cybernetic therapy.  One day, Bunnie was relaxing by the power ring pool 
when Sonic, who had been somewhat distant, approached her.
	"Bunnie," he said "I have a question."
	"What is it," she asked.
	"Do you blame me?"
	"For what?"     
	"For not saving you in time."
	"Well now what ever prompted an idea like that," asked Bunnie "If 
anything, you saved me in the nick of time.  If you had been any longer, 
the process would have completed and I'd be a robotic slave in Robotnik's 
work force."
	"Really?" asked Sonic.
	"Really," confirmed Bunnie "and hopefully, one day, we'll find a 
way to reverse this."
	"Yes," said Sonic, turning to gaze at the setting sun in the west.
	"One day..."

	The snow lay thick on the ground.  Deep in the Diamond Mountains, a 
rebel village lay in total ruin.  Huts had been destroyed, fires burned in 
the remains of homes.  Blast marks left by powerful laser rifles scorched 
the surrounding mountains, and a few of the surrounding trees had either 
been destroyed, or were burning.  Among all the destruction, a lone shuttle 
sat on its own with a lone passenger inside.
	Commander Packbell sat in front of his computer in the shuttle 
writing his report.  It had been about four hours since the last of the 
prisoner transports had departed.  Whenever he successfully located and 
overpowered a group of freedom fighters, he always stayed around for a while 
writing the report that would be turned in at Central Command.
	The raid had gone very well.  His forces charged in, eliminated the 
resistance and captured the survivors.  They had managed to capture 103 
freedom fighters this time around.  That brought Packbell's personal total 
to 613 captured freedom fighters.  The losses had been minimal, ten bots on 
his side and fifteen rebels on the other side.  As soon as he finished his 
report, he stood up and went outside to survey all the damage.
	Everything was in ruin.  As he strode through the remains, he came 
across a hut that had somehow managed to stay standing.  Upon entering, he 
found the inside to be in utter chaos.  Apparently the result of rebels 
scattering in fear as Swat-bots busted in.  As he looked about, he noticed 
something lying on the floor in the corner.  Packbell bent down and examined 
it.
	Christmas tree, he thought to himself.  He had never understood the 
concept of Christmas.  The very idea had appeared to him to be absolutely 
pointless.  He had judged the holiday to be inefficient.  Nothing important 
ever got done during this time.  What was the point of wasting time giving 
gifts when one could be working to better himself like Packbell did.  
Granted, Packbell did hang around the Command Center often, doing nothing, 
but he didn't call that wasting time, he called that waiting for orders.
	"Well," he said, standing "no Christmas for these rebels."
	He pulled his laser pistol and fried the tree into ashes.
	Returning to the shuttle, Packbell headed back to Robotropolis.

	Meanwhile, deep in the great forest, the freedom fighters of 
Knothole where celebrating the season.  Everywhere one looked, there were 
signs of the Christmas spirit. Sonic and Tails were having snowball fights, 
Bookshire was helping Sally decorate the huts, Antoine was trying to decide 
what to give the Princess for Christmas, and Dulci and Rotor were busy 
putting up a hundred foot Christmas Tree in the center of Knothole.  Dulci 
would move it into position while Rotor calculated the optimum angle in 
which the tree should be positioned so that it wouldn't fall down in case of 
a snow storm.
	Once the tree had been set, all the freedom fighters gathered around 
to decorate it.  the decoration of the tree was something the freedom 
fighters looked forward to every year, and, as with all the years before, 
when the decoration was complete, Tails would fly up to the top and place 
the star on top of the tree.
	The ceremony had gone well.  Afterwards, Sally, Rotor and Tails went 
over to help Bookshire decorate his tree.
	"You know," remarked Bookshire as they came in "I don't think the 
tree has ever looked better."
	"Yeah," replied Rotor "we did a real good job on it."
	"How would you all like something to drink?" said Bookshire "I've 
got freshly made eggnog in the fridge."
	"Great!" said Rotor and Tails.
	"No thanks," said Sally "Eggnog is real fattening."
	"Relax, Sal," replied Bookshire "It's totally low in fat and 
cholesterol.  I made it without any egg yolks; only egg whites."
	"Well," said Sally "I suppose."
	"Great," said Bookshire as he went into the kitchen.
	"So," said Rotor "What are you two asking Santa for for Christmas?"
	"Peace and good will," said Sally "I ask for it every year.  One 
of these years I'm sure my request will be granted."
	"I'm asking for some new running shoes," said Tails "The ones I 
have are wearing out." 
	"Sounds good," said Bookshire as he returned with four cups of 
	eggnog.
	After decorating the tree they all went to bed.

	Meanwhile, back in Robotropolis, Packbell was pacing the hallways, 
deep in thought.  He had decided to get Robotnik something close to a 
Christmas present in order to better understand what the big deal was.  If 
he was ever going to overthrow Robotnik, he decided, it would be nice to 
know about these things.  However, he had encountered two problems: (1) how 
to give the gift without Robotnik suspecting it was a present and (2) what 
to get him.  He stopped in the hallway a thought for a moment.
	"What does Robotnik want more than anything in the world?" he asked 
himself.
	After a few moments an evil smile spread across his face.
	"The location of Knothole Village," he answered simply.  It would be 
a tall order, but Packbell was confident that he knew who could find out for 
him.  Turning on his heel, he walked back to the docking platform to get a 
shuttle.

	Packbell's shuttle flew silently through the dark of night.  After a 
time, it came to rest at the edge of the Great Swamp.  After leaving the 
shuttle, Packbell walked into the swamp.  He took various routes, making 
several turns before he arrived at his destination.  He entered a small 
clearing, stood in the center, and waited.
	"Well, well, well, its only been a week," said a voice, suddenly 
"does the high a mighty Packbell need my assistance again?"
	Packbell was not impressed.
	"Knock it off, Sandra," he said into the darkness "You should know 
by now that your mysterious front doesn't impress me."
	"Very well," said Sandra "what can I do for you this time?"
	"Very simple, really.  I would like the location of Knothole 
Village," said Packbell.
	"Knothole?  Isn't that where Princess Sally hides out?" asked Sandra.
	"Correct," replied Packbell.
	"A tough assignment," said Sandra "You understand that you are 
asking me to betray a member of the royal family."
	"Of course," said Packbell "but I don't see a problem.  Unless, you 
are actually loyal the her."
	"Of course not!" snapped Sandra "I'm loyal to no one but myself."
	"Then you'll do it?" asked Packbell.
	"I'll have to think about it," replied Sandra "What would you give me if I gave you this information?"
	"What do you want?" asked Packbell.
	"Well," replied Sandra "in that case, get me the Crown Jewels of 
Mobius and I'll think about it."
	"Done," said Packbell.   As he turned to leave, he heard a rustling 
in the bushes to his right as Sandra sprinted off into the swamp.
	"One day," he thought "I'll find out what she really looks like."
	
	Sandra Nightweaver sprinted through the Great Swamp as a breakneck 
pace.  Her black fur blended with the night so as to make her virtually 
invisible.  Soon she arrived at her hideout.  She sat down at her desk and 
opened a map of The Great Forest.  It was going to be tricky, but she was 
confident she would pull it off.  She gathered up a few things and departed 
for The Great Forest.

	As Christmas came ever closer, so did the spirit of Christmas come 
with it.  The Christmas celebration in Knothole was in full swing. On top 
of everything else, Bookshire had managed to locate a database on his 
computer that had some Christmas music in it by a little known group called 
Mannheim Steamroller.  It was a unique kind of instrumental music that had 
been done entirely with synthesizers as well as traditional instruments.
	"I am a little concerned," Sally was saying to Sonic as they walked 
along.
	"What about?"  asked Sonic.
	"Well," she said "What if Robotnik tries something that will ruin 
the magic of the season."
	"Then I'll go bust it up like I always do." replied Sonic.
	"You really think you could handle anything?" asked Sally as they 
stopped walking for a moment.
	"Oh sure," replied Sonic "I can handle anything.  I'm fully 
qualified."
	"Oh really," said Sally laughing a little bit "And what are your 
qualifications?"
	"I'm fast, determined, way past cool, and sneaky," replied Sonic.
	"Sneaky, huh, " said Sally "Prove it."
	"Easy," said Sonic "look up."
	Sally looked up a saw a sprig of mistletoe that Sonic had hung up 
above where they were standing.
	"So,"  said Sonic "what do ya' say!"
	"Well," said Sally, pretending to hesitate "I suppose."
	The two embraced and, after a moment gazing into each others eyes, 
they engaged in a kiss.
	
	Later that night, a dark figure moved though the surrounding forest.  
Sandra Nightweaver had been searching for three days, and now she had found 
them.   She moved closer to Knothole to get a better look at it.

	Bookshire was sitting in front of his computer playing a video game 
when, suddenly, a quiet alarm went off.  Completely startled, Bookshire 
fell back off of his chair.  Standing, he moved over to another monitor 
and turned off the alarm.  He examined the  monitor carefully.
	"Looks like we have company," he said to himself.  Quickly grabbing 
his coat and cane,  he headed out into the night.

	Sandra concealed herself behind some bushes on the fringes of 
Knothole.  After examining the place for a while, she stood carefully and 
ran from the village.  Suddenly, someone appeared before her.
	"And just where do you think you're going?" asked Bookshire, 
stepping into the moon light.
	Without answering, Sandra charged forward, intent on escape.  As 
she passed by Bookshire, he quickly stuck out his cane, catching her legs.  
Sandra tripped and fell face first into the snow with such force that it 
knocked her out.

	Sandra didn't come around until the next morning.  When she did, 
she found herself in a bed with Rotor, Sally, Sonic and Bookshire standing 
over her.
	After a few moments of tense silence Sonic spoke.
	"Who are you," he asked simply.
	"No one you need to know about," replied Sandra.
	"Don't give us that," said Sally "You're Sandra Nightweaver aren't 
you."
	Sandra said nothing.
	"My father told me about you on more than one occasion," said Sally 
"Breaking and entering, theft, espionage.  I believe those have been you're 
crimes.  I believe that you also tried to rip off the royal treasury at one 
point didn't you."
	"Well, your highness, it looks like you've got me cold," said Sandra.
	"Why are you here," asked Rotor.        
	"Just gathering a little information," she replied.
	"You're planning to sell us out to Robotnik aren't you," said Sally 
"I've got half a mind to arrest you for treason right now."
	"Go ahead," said Sandra, smiling "you can't keep me here.  Your 
father's high tech prisons couldn't hold me and I don't think whatever you 
have now can either."
	"She's right you know," said Bookshire "Know matter what we do, 
she'll probably escape somehow.  So, I suppose the real question is what 
will she do?"
	"Are you really going to sell us out, Sandra?" asked Bookshire.
	"I'm still thinking about it," replied Sandra.
	"Oh yeah," said Sonic "Well, think about this.  If you sell us out 
we'll make sure every freedom fighter on the planet hears of your betrayal.  
You'll never be welcome anywhere ever again."
	"Perhaps," replied Sandra "However, aside from that not happening, 
what else would you offer me to keep my mouth shut."
	"I'll tell you what," said Sally "You keep our location a secret 
and I'll consider granting you a full pardon at the end of the war."
	"However, your winning the war is not a sure thing," said Sandra.
	"Perhaps, but this a far better deal than anything Robotnik would 
give you if you were talking to him instead of me," said Sally.
	"Like I said before, I'm still thinking about it," Sandra replied.
	"As you wish," said Sally.
	The group left her alone, and, later that evening, she slipped 
unnoticed from the village."

	Meanwhile, Packbell was walking through the halls of the central 
command center, feeling so pleased that he was going to get the location of 
Knothole that he couldn't resist whispering a short tune he invented.
	"Jingle bells, 'buttnik smells
	Snively is a geek
	Compared to me, its plain to see
	they're idiots of the week!"
	He laughed a little as he finished and headed for the docking bay 
to go meet Sandra.

	Packbell's shuttle landed at the edge of the Great Swamp once again, 
and once again he took the same route to the same clearing to see what 
Sandra had to say.
	"Sandra," he called out into the darkness.
	"I'm here," came the reply.
	"Did you get the information I requested?" asked Packbell.
	"Yes," replied Sandra "I suppose you want it."
	"I kind of had that in mind," said Packbell.
	There was a long pause.  Sandra sat in her hiding place trying to 
make up her mind.  Finally, she reached a decision.
	"Well," said Packbell "let's have it."
	"Actually," said Sandra "I don't think I'll tell you."
	"What?!" exclaimed Packbell.
	"I told you I was still thinking about it, and I've decided that, 
when it comes down to it, I'm not going to betray a member of the royal 
family," announced Sandra.
	"I don't believe this!" exclaimed Packbell as he got angry "You know, 
Sandra, if you were a Swat-bot standing in front of me, I'd blast you into 
scrap metal so fast you wouldn't have time to realize what had happened!"
	He turned and stormed out of the clearing.  Suddenly, he stopped 
and turned back one last time.
	"Know this, Sandra Nightweaver," he called out "from now on you are 
a freedom fighter to me, and if you I ever get my hands on you, you will be 
treated as such!"
	"And proud of it!" called Sandra as she sprinted off into the swamp.
	Packbell stood there for a few moments clenching his fists, and 
wishing he had something to strangle.  After a moment he calmed down.
	"Christmas sucks," he said.
	Packbell turned and walked back to the shuttle.

	A few days later, Christmas Eve arrived and a sort of pleasant 
peace settled over Knothole.
	"Don't the stars look wonderful," remarked Sally as she and sonic 
walked down the path.
	"They sure do," replied Sonic.
	"Do you think Sandra turned us in?" asked Sally.
	"Doubtful," said Bookshire walking up behind them "Despite all the 
claims she's made at being a loner, she still needs some support from the 
rest of us."
	"Do you think we'll ever see her again?" asked Sonic.
	"Who can say," said Bookshire "in this crazy war, anything's 
possible.  Well, good night you two."
	Bookshire turned and walked toward his house.
	"You know, Bookshire's right," said Sonic "I don't think she did it."
	"You're probably right, Sonic," said Sally.
	Christmas Eve slowly slipped away...

	The next morning was a time for celebration. The entire morning was 
spent opening presents followed by a huge feast.  Everyone got something 
they had asked for.  The only thing that had not come was global peace and 
good will.  However, the important thing was the, in the heart of every 
freedom fighter was the idea, the belief, that one day soon, they would be 
able to celebrate without having to worry if they would make it to the next 
year.  They would finally have what they fought so hard for year round... 
freedom.

THE END

This is Bookshire sending a message to all of you in cyberspace, to 
everyone in the country and all over the world, to everyone in this 
universe and where ever life exists... Merry Christmas.

	Night had fallen over the Great Forest.  All throughout Knothole, 
freedom fighters were retiring for the night.  Summer had just started, but 
the nights remained a little chilly in the Forest, considering it's somewhat 
high altitude.
	Tails lay in bed trying to go to sleep.  It was that time between 
getting in bed and actually going to sleep when one's mind wanders to all 
sorts of different thoughts and ideas.  Tails thought about lots of things 
during this time.  He turned his head slightly and looked out the window to 
the stars above.  It's a beautiful night out, he thought to himself.  
Whenever he looked at the stars, he always paid attention to one specific 
constellation.  It was one that he remembered seeing all the time over his 
old home. 
	Home, he thought.  A day had never passed that he didn't think of 
it.  The peace, the tranquility, his parents.  He missed his parents a good 
deal.  Missing them wasn't so bad, the problem was he didn't know if they 
were alive or dead, and, if they were alive, if they were robotizized or 
not.  It hadn't been that long ago when they were separated, only three 
years.  That had been when he was seven, but the memories were still fresh 
in his mind as if they had happened yesterday...

	The village of Bluebrook was a quiet little place populated by 
people living normal lives.  It was quite a distance away from Robotropolis.  
So far in fact that, combined with the concealment by the natural landscape, 
most thought that Robotnik would never find them.  All they had to do was 
keep a low profile.  It had been Tails' home for a long as he could 
remember.  His parents, Elrond and Sarah Prower, were kind, loving parents 
that tried to make their son's life as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.  
The one part of his life, however, that he had never agreed with was their 
choice of names.  When he was born, they had named him Miles.  It was a name 
that he had never liked, and, when he was four, started calling himself 
Tails because he thought that it suited him far better.  The young fox had, 
in fact, been born with two tails.  Not actually a birth defect, it was 
simply the result of a normally suppressed gene that had become dominant in 
his case.  Other than that, Tails' life was uneventful, but all that was 
about to change.

	Cmdr. Packbell sat at his desk in his secret room looking over 
information on his computer terminal.  He had been getting reports recently 
of freedom fighter activity from various locations around the planet, and it 
was up to him to eliminate them if he could.  It wasn't something that he 
was particularly concerned about given his perfect track record, except 
that he was always having to convince Robotnik of his ability.  He really 
hated Robotnik.  He found it hard sometimes to have the patience to wait for 
that one day when he would crush Robotnik and take his place as ruler of 
Mobius.
	Oh well, he thought.  He looked down the list of possible freedom 
fighter locations.  The list had ten names on it.
	No problem, thought Packbell, I'll just lay out a flight plan that 
takes me through all ten of them and nail whichever ones I can. 
	He smiled to himself as he began to lay out his strategy.

	Meanwhile, back in Bluebrook, life went about it's business.  Elrond 
Prower was talking with the leader of the village, one Riff Underwood, a 
swift, smart rabbit with natural leadership abilities.
	"I think we might have a problem," Riff was saying "Recent reports 
indicate that there's been a good deal of activity in Robotropolis as of 
late."
	"Do you think it poses any type of threat to us?" asked Elrond.
	"Not at the moment, but it might," Riff replied "I'm going to order 
that this village keep as low a profile as possible.  If we draw any 
attention to ourselves in anyway the results would be disastrous."
	"Then it's to be hoped that we don't draw any attention," responded 
Elrond.
	He checked his chronometer.
	"Well, it's getting late," he said "I need to get home."
	"Good night, Elrond," said Riff.
	"Good night."
	
	Elrond arrived at his home to find his wife and son waiting for him.
	"So, what did you and Riff talk about all day?" asked Sarah as they 
sat down for dinner.
	"Not much," replied Elrond, glancing at Tails briefly "just the 
weather and the party next week."
	"That's good," remark Sarah.  She knew from his expression that he 
had more to say, but neither of them ever talked about such things in front 
of their son.
	"Oh, by the way," said Elrond "Riff and I are going to inspect some 
of the forest areas around the village tomorrow for possible look-out sites 
so I might be getting home a little late."
	"You always come home late, Dad," said Tails.
	"I know, Miles," said Elrond "but it's all for the good of the 
community.  You wouldn't want nasty old Robotnik to show up because we 
didn't take any precautions, would you?"
	"Bring him on!" said Tails excitedly "I'd run circles around him and 
beat him into the ground just like Sonic!"
	"You really believe in him don't you," remarked Sarah.
	"You bet.  Sonic's my hero," said Tails "Can I be excused."
	"Sure," said Elrond.
	Tails got up and left the room.  After he left, Sarah turned to her 
husband.
	"I think he listens to that travelling storyteller too much," Sarah 
said.
	"Well, it's good that he should have something to believe in," said 
Elrond "especially during times like these."
	"True enough I suppose," said Sarah "Now, what were you and Riff 
really talking about?"
	"There's been some concern lately that Robotnik's forces might 
locate this village," said Elrond quietly.
	"How much concern?" asked Sarah.
	"Well, it's not a real danger yet, but Riff feels we'll need to 
start taking more precautions from now on," said Elrond.
	"Well, I just hope that Robotnik never finds this place," remarked 
Sarah.
	"So do I," replied Elrond.
	The two foxes cleaned off the table as night fell into place.

	Later that night, Sarah entered Tails' bedroom and sat down beside 
him.
	"Would you like to hear a story before you go to bed Miles?" she 
asked, knowing what he'd say.
	"Yes!" he replied as he settled further into his bed.
	"What do you want to hear?" she asked.
	"Tell me more about what it was like before the war," he asked 
sleepily.
	Sarah smiled at her son.  Tails had been born one year after 
Robotnik had taken control of the planet.  For as long as he could remember, 
there was the war and nothing else.  Sarah sat back in her chair and started 
to speak.
	"Before the war, there was clean air and sunshine.  People were free 
and could go where ever they wished.  We were ruled by a good and wise King.  
He made sure that every citizen was provided with what they needed and that 
the balance between nature and technology was maintained.  There were pure 
white clouds in the sky.  There were large open fields where you could 
run and play and not feel yourself in any danger.  You didn't have to hide 
yourself away when certain people came by.  In Mobitropolis, there was once 
a beautiful fountain outside the royal palace.  In the diamond mountains 
there was a time where you could surround yourself in rainbows if the light 
from the rising sun struck them just right.  Mobius was a place of beauty, 
peace, joy, and freedom."
	Sarah looked down at her sleeping child.  Despite all the love she 
held for him, it hurt to see him sometimes.  He was growing up in a world 
that would not allow him to take advantage of the things she herself had 
once known.  The world of a peaceful Mobius was just a fantasy in his mind 
instead of the wonderful reality she had taken for granted.  These days she 
only held one true hope in her heart and that was that her son should have a 
chance to see a peaceful Mobius.  One that wasn't at war.  Neither she nor 
Elrond mattered now.  She wanted her son to know peace.  She wanted him to 
know, to feel, the wonderful feelings and experiences that she and Elrond 
held in their memories.  Standing quietly, she turned out the light and 
left the room.

	As the night passed, Pacbell's forces moved swiftly but silently 
through the skies.  Pacbell was feeling very pleased with himself.  He had 
managed to capture 245 freedom fighters so far and there were only two 
village names left on his list.  With any luck, he decided, he should have 
them taken care of by noon the next day.

	The next morning as promised, Elrond left to go meet Riff at the 
edge of the village.  They had only been exploring the area for twenty 
minutes when their sensors picked up something.
	"What is it," asked Riff.
	Elrond studied the reading a moment longer.
	"I think it's a robotropolis attack force," Elrond said nervously.
	"We've got to get back and warn the village!" exclaimed Riff.
	The two ran back to the village as fast as they could go.

	Meanwhile, deep in The Great Forest, at the top secret freedom 
fighter village of Knothole, life was proceeding normally.
	Princess Sally was sitting in front of her communications monitoring 
console fixing a few things when it suddenly picked up a faint transmission 
on a coded frequency.  Dropping what she was doing, Sally had NICOLE break 
the code and display the resulting message on the screen:

PRIORITY MESSAGE TO ROBOTROPOLIS CENTRAL COMMAND

FROM: CMDR. PACKBELL
SERVICE NO.:  546003-3F

REPORT:
	SEARCH AND CAPTURE MISSION IS A SUCCESS.  CURRENTLY FINISHING 
OPERATION ON BLUEBROOK VILLAGE.  NUMBER CAPTURED AS OF THIS TIME -- 304.  
ESTIMATED TIME TO FINISH -- 5:00 MINUTES. . .

--- PACKBELL

	Realizing the urgency of the situation, Sally jumped up and ran to 
get the others.

	Meanwhile, the village of Bluebrook was in utter chaos.  Creatures 
were fleeing in every direction to escape the Swat-bots marching through 
the village.  Some tried to fight them, but it was a hopeless battle.  
Through the panic, Packbell walked confidently, taking pot shots at 
everything that moved, not really caring what he hit.  As he walked through 
the village, he relished the screams of terror and the sight of panicked 
creatures fleeing for their lives.  To a twisted mind like his, this was 
paradise.
	When it was finally over, he totalled up the captures as the 
surviving prisoners were marched into the transports.
	"25 foxes, 43 ferrets, 12 rabbits, 13 raccoons, and 5 hedgehogs," he 
noted to himself "not a bad score at all."
	He smiled a little as he turned and went back to his private shuttle 
to return to Robotropolis with his latest catch.

	A short while later, a stolen shuttle landed in the middle of what 
was once a village of peace.  Sally, Bunnie, Rotor, and Bookshire emerged 
as Sonic raced up to meet them.
	"We're too late," Sonic said "the place is deserted."
	The five were silent for a moment before Sally spoke.
	"Very well," she said "It looks like all that left is to clean up.  
Bunnie and I will check for anything salvageable.  Sonic, you can patrol 
the perimeter for danger.  Bookshire and Rotor will count the casualties."
	The five went about the grim task that Robotnik's forces left for 
them.

	"Well done, indeed, commander," Robotnik was saying "I'd promote you 
if you weren't already in one of the highest positions in the central 
command."
	"Of course, sir," responded Packbell.
	"So, since I can't promote you, you can just keep doing what you've 
been doing and be happy with that," said Robotnik.
	"Thank you, sir," answered Packbell flatly.  He turned on his heel 
and left, kicking Snively roughly to one side as he passed.
	Packbell went down to the main robotization center where those whom 
he had captured were being put through the Robotizizer.  As they went, 
some shouted defiance and threats, others begged for mercy and their lives, 
others simply cried.  Some where still in shock and remained silent.
	As Packbell watched, he noted two foxes with calm, collected 
expressions. Two who had apparently resigned themselves to their fate.  
Either that or they what to be Martyrs sacrificing themselves for their 
cause, thought Pacbell.
	"Oh well," he said to himself "too bad there's no one around to make 
a note of it for the history books."
	Pacbell turned and left the machines to their work.

	At the site of the ruins of what was once the village of Bluebrook, 
the freedom fighters continued with their tasks.
	Bookshire was crouched by a fallen creature looking for 
identification when Rotor walked up.
	"There are two more back behind that building," he said.
	Bookshire sigh in response.  He located and ID card and silently 
read it.
	"Riff Underwood, village leader," he said quietly "what a loss."
	"This is a nightmare," grumbled Rotor.
	"I know," responded Bookshire as he stood "Well, that just about 
does it, let's find Sally."
	
	Sally and Bunnie were picking through the wreckage looking for 
anything they might be able to use.  As they picked through the rubble of 
one of the houses, they suddenly heard a noise that sounded as if it had 
come from one of the back rooms.  The two walked carefully through the 
debris and into what must have, at one time, been a bedroom. The room wasn't 
quite as messy as the rest of the house.  Apparently, the bots didn't search 
it.  As they enter the room, Sally and Bunnie heard something under the 
bed.  When they bent down to look, a surprising sight met their eyes.
	Crouched under the bed with his face buried in his arms and 
trembling uncontrollably was a small fox that couldn't be any more than 
seven or eight at the most.  The two tried getting his attention, but it 
soon became obvious that he had been terrified out of his senses.
	"Bunnie," said Sally "we need to get at him.  Can you move this bed?"
	"Sure thing," replied Bunnie.  She seized the bed with her robotic 
arm and moved it easily to one side.
	As they knelt down next to him, Bookshire and Rotor entered.  They 
were momentarily startled by the appearance of a survivor, but they continued 
with their report.
	"We're all finished," said Rotor "we counted thirty-five."
	"Thank you very much," said Sally "This disaster, as you can see, has 
taken a new twist."
	Bookshire knelt down beside the fox and examined him.
	"Looks like extreme shock," he concluded.
	"Yes, that was my guess too," said Sally "Needless to say, we'll 
take him back to Knothole with us when we leave."
	"Good idea," said Sonic as he raced up "there's a swat-bot patrol 
heading this way."
	Bunnie picked up the fox and they ran back to the shuttle where they 
took off and headed back to Knothole at top speed.

	When they arrived back at Knothole, the fox had been placed in a 
spare room just adjacent to Sally's room where he began his recovery from 
the terrible events he had witnessed.  It wasn't until three days later that 
he came around and was actually conscious of his surroundings.  When he first 
opened his eyes, Sally and Sonic were sitting beside the bed.
	"You don't need to be afraid," Sally assured him "you're with 
friends."
	"Who are you?" the fox asked a little shakily.
	"My name is Sally, and this is Sonic," replied Sally "and what's 
your name?"
	"My real name is Miles, but I like Tails," Tails replied "Are you 
really Sonic the Hedgehog?"
	"Indeed I am," said Sonic "You've heard of me?"
	"Are you kidding?" exclaimed Tails, brightening up considerably 
"You're my hero!  Every time the traveling storyteller came to my village, 
he did nothing but talk about you!  Are you really as fast as they say you 
are?"
	"Am I fast!? Am I fast!?. . .,"began Sonic.
	Sally rolled her eyes.  Here we go again, she thought.
	"Is the sky blue, is dirt dirty?  I'm the fastest thing on the face 
of the planet!" said Sonic, proudly.
	"Wow," remarked Tails.  He was completely awestruck.  After all of 
the stories he had heard, he had finally met his hero.
	Oh well, thought Sally, at least that should make his recovery 
easier.

	And, in fact, the recovery went very smoothly.  It did take some 
time for Tails to come to terms with the fact that he had been separated 
from his parents and that it wasn't likely he'd see them again for quite a 
while, but he accepted it eventually.  His parents had taught him well to 
accept whatever life gave him.  It didn't mean he liked his situation, but 
he had accepted that that's the way it was.  During one of the first nights 
he spent in Knothole, he promised himself that he'd find his parents again 
one day, and, until then, he had good friends that would look out for him 
and take care of him until he did.  One day, he'd find them again.
	One day . . .


	Tails drifted of to sleep quietly that chilly night at the beginning 
of Summer. Those last words and the images of the past were that last things 
in his mind before it collapsed into sleep.
	Night passed in The Great Forest.  Every freedom fighter slept 
peacefully.  Each one held the dream that one day they would find true 
happiness again with loved ones they had lost.  each one waited patiently 
for that one day when peace would once again reign over Mobius and they 
would be able to live normal lives again.  Deep in their hearts, they knew 
that day would come.  All these things would almost certainly come to 
pass. . . 

. . . one day.

Your network affiliate is not required to clear any network programs, and 
those they do clear they can run at any day/time they choose.  Networks 
can and do offer inducements such as cash or threats of disaffiliation, 
but they cannot compel your local station to do what they want.  But 
networks do reserve the right to place their programming elsewhere in the 
market if the affiliate is uncooperative.

Check supermarkets, drug stores, and convenient stores too.  That's where I 
get 'em.  Issue 21 has a coupon for ordering back issues (#1 through #7 
plus the In Your Face special).

There are three tapes of the Saturday morning series (2 episodes each) 
and several tapes of the weekday series (the latter called "Adventures of 
StH").  Check toy stores, K-Mart, Wal-Mart, and the like.  Alternatively, 
you might want to contact Whole Toon Catalog at (206) 391-8747.

Fleetway's address was recently posted.  If you missed it, you will find 
it when I release the next merchandise list.  I'm running behind on 
things but I want to get the new one posted around mid-week.

Music by Spencer Nilsen
Lyrics by Spencer Nilsen and Pastiche

If you're strong you can fly
You can reach the other side
Of the rainbow
It's alright, take a chance
'Cause there is no circumstance
That you can't handle
    (when you use your mind)

Mr. Bad's got it good
But this ain't his neighborhood
He's takin' over... no, no
Time is now, he can't hide
Find the power deep inside
And make it happen

CHORUS:
Sonic Boom
Sonic Boom
Trouble keeps you runnin' faster
Sonic Boom...
Save the planet from disaster
Sonic Boom...
Spinning through a world in motion
Sonic Boom...
Take it all the way

Make your move, break it out
That's what life is all about
It's your adventure
From the dark to the light
It's a supersonic flight
Gotta keep it going

   I'm assuming they named it after the German mathematician, Agust Ferdinand
Mobius (with two dots over the "o") who discovered the Mobius strip, which is
like a one sided, three-dimensional loop.

   That's the treasure hunter, Knack, a weasle.  He, along with Knuckles,
hasn't been in anything yet.  (Maybe in the next season?)

Actually, Rotor isn't terribly obvious to me, at least over, say, Axel or 
Phillips.  (:3  As for 'Miles': well, his full name is Miles Prower.  
Think about it for a while, and if that doesn't help, try saying it

Well, it's named Mobius in the game, though it's unclear whether the name 
refers to the entire planet or just Sonic's neck of the woods (not 
counting, say, the Floating Island of S3&K).  When I heard about the 
rearrangement of the levels in Sonic 1 for the American release, I 
thought of Moebius strips, but I suspect that was an unintended reference...

I couldn't say with any authority, but I suspect DIC invents new 
locations as needed for the plot.  As for Sega, I don't know of anything 
official, but I *do* still have notes I took from the games "Sonic" and 
"Sonic 2" in an attempt to construct a Sonic Zone on FurToonia (a MUSH I 
(in)frequent); if anyone's interested, I'll work them up into a 
topography and post them to the list for kibitzing.

Note: there is a rather large inconsistency (IMHO) between the game and 
the comic/show in terms of the topography of Mobius: the area of Sonic 1 
and 2 is a rather large island, but I have yet to see a show or comic 
depict a lagoon, much less the ocean proper.  Anyone know how, in the 
comic, the crew got to Floating/Angel Island and where it was located 
(was it actually out in the ocean, or just floating around in the sky, or 
what?)

The FAQ I promised in the list's welcome text is now available.  And so 
is another FAQ.  The filenames are "faq-dd" and "faq-jf" (without the 
quotes); the "dd" and "jf" are the initials of the authors.

To request Dan Drazen's FAQ (taken from rec.arts.animation), send this 
text to majordomo@sard.mv.net:
   get sonic faq-dd
   end

To request James Firmiss's FAQ (taken from this list), send this text to 
majordomo@sard.mv.net:
   get sonic faq-jf
   end

If you want both FAQ's, send this text:
   get sonic faq-dd
   get sonic faq-jf
   end


There is some redundant information, but there is a lot of information 
found in one but not the other.  I would like to ask the two authors and 
others interested in helping out to merge the FAQ's into a single 
document.  This will make it a little easier to locate information.  Once 
this is done, the new FAQ can be loaded for retrieval through Majordomo.

The merchandise list is going to get fairly long, so I think it's better 
to keep it out of the FAQ and kept in its own file.  Because the 
information on the comics (summaries, character appearance chart, etc.) 
will be added-to regularly, it may be advisable to split that off too so 
as to keep the FAQ to a manageable size.  Any opinions on this split?  
Should any other splits be considered?

This is entirely off the wall, but the episode "Blast to the Past" comes to
mind.  Like many movies such as the Terminator series, the show apparently
supports the theory of circular time, where future events simultaneously
affect the past, and vice versa.  If Sonic and Sally weren't rescued by
their future selves at the time of Robotnik's coup, then they couldn't
travel back in time to save their younger selves in said coup.  I remember
someone on this list referring to it as a Mobius strip in time--2 sides,
1 journey...

...ah, never mind.

Which brings to mind the question, why is Archie Publications proudly
displaying and replying to mail concerning Knuckles when he has yet to
even appear in the story!  Anything for readership, I guess.

Continuing the video game discussion (bear with me), the next time you
play S+K, pay attention to the Flying Battalion taking off at the end
of the Mushroom Zone.  Who's flying the plane?!!?!  Robotnik's in his
egg-vehicle (whatever it's called), and there is someone else at the
controls of the Battalion.  The closest thing I can think of is a fox.
Anybody got any ideas?

I found that reference also, however, the name "Mobius" as it is pronounced 
in  the
show is technically different than the mathematician.  HIS NAME is pronounced:
<MU.bE.us>
where the U in MU sounds like "you"
who knows, maybe DIC doesn't know  much German...;)

YES!  that is by far the best run-down I've heard of that great show!  (It 
probably
has nothing to do with anything else)  but I think it's great!  
O.K. _OTHER_ than a reference to that strip or said German professor, any other
ideas for "Mobius" origin?  (I give up) ;)

If the files are available for normal ftp, it's not necessary to post 
them here.  Those without ftp access can use ftpmail.

To find out more about ftpmail, send "help" (without the quotes) in a 
message sent to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Be sure you post the address, 
full pathlist, and all of the filenames so users can use ftpmail to get 
these files.

Binary files can be very large and can, therefore, be a problem for those 
who pay for incoming mail and/or use limited-resource systems.

Texts tend to be smaller and, therefore, less of a problem if posted to
the list.  If for any reason you want to offer files that you cannot make
easily accessed without the help of a Web browser or similar tools, then
it would be a good idea to post them here unless we know everyone has
access to the proper tools. 

Although ftpmail is not particularly convenient to use, it does help 
conserve 'net resources when you want to offer large files.

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  At this point, there is
no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're
pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer
the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution
of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails had not
been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .sea lion (cf, Teitelbaum)
Antoine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.

Despite this statement, controversy continues.  Identifying
Sally's species has been particularly vexing to some fans,
especially those who reason that since Sally's father is clearly
a fox, then she must be one herself.  It is possible that Sally
takes after her mother in this regard more than her father. 
Cross-species mating is a definite possibility, and an example is
implied in the "flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade"
[Sonic: In Your Face #1].

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified in the Sonic-Gram Extra, vol.  
1, no. 1, Winter 94-95; I am still trying to identify a first
usage of the name.  Technically, royalty do not have         
surnames or family names in the accepted sense; rather, the title
of the personage tends to serve the purpose.  Her middle name,
Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf. "Blast to the Past," part
1).  If you wanted to be grandiose about it, Sally's formal title
would be: Sally Alicia, Princess of the House of Acorn.  But in
any event it's unlikely that Sally's formal title will come back
into use so long as Robotnik is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
Presuming that the age of majority on Mobius is 18, that would
mean Sonic and Sally are both 16 years old, though the comics
reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the
number of years Robotnik has been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would
appear that Tails was born after the fall of the House of Acorn. 
Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma would be to put the
age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of 18; that would
eliminate the extra year differential without altering the stated
ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood
Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differs in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
features Geoffrey St. John, while another does not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  The
fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS Sega
reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series (as
reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to indicate
that someone had come down with a case of "creative differences."
In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began shipping the
week of Feb 13.

Sonic Past Cool
SYNOPSIS NEEDED

Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
contends with a super-fast robot designed to capture him.

          2.   Second Season

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face immanent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is almost blown.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  And will there be a third season?

FYI: for anyone who needs to contact the offices of Archie Comics
in Mamaroneck, NY, their phone number is: (914) 381-5155.

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
COMING SOON

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

I guess I can't argue, but I will say that I LOL at Tails's note to Sonic, 
with the PS: "If you're really dead, then ignore this note!"  :^)

Welcome to the list.  I tried several times to send you mail to let you 
know that what is now your version of the FAQ can now be made a 
retrievable file.  I got your FAQ from rec.arts.animation and submitted 
it for placement with the few other files.

If you get the list of files, you will see that 2 FAQ's are available.  I 
have already requested on the list that we try to merge them into one 
document.  For info on file retrieval, send "help" followed by "end" to 
majordomo@sard.mv.net.

I will capture any future versions from the list, so there's no need to 
Cc it to me.

I am going to try to make more files available through Majordomo.  I will 
soon update the list's intro text with info about the files.

Isn't "Mobius" the name of some famous French artist?  The "Airtight
Garage" comes to mind.

Greetings, fellow Sonic fanatics!

Gee, have a little computer trouble for a few days, and look at
all the E-mail I get!  106 messages to this date (as of 2-14-95);
this will take a while to sift through.  But I have returned, and I've
obtained the inspiration to write a Sonic (or related character)
story.  Great work, guys!

I hope that there wasn't anyone expecting a responce from me
on a particular subject.  I've been off since last Wed., and I haven't
had the opprotunity to fix the problem until VERY lately.  I'll get back
to y'all ASAP.

Shawn Wolski, N5UNA

Erich,

So noted.

I'm still getting the hang of ftp-ing, since I usually just used e-mail
to simply send and receive, as well as get into usenet groups.  Will do
my best to stay on top of things.

Sorry to say that, but I _DON'T_ think that the current artwork in the  
comic is good.

I don't know about the second season of Sonic cartoons, but compared to  
the episodes I saw from the first season most characters in the comic  
differ a lot from the ones in the cartoon in the size of head, shoes, arms  
and legs (especially Sonic and Tails). In addition to that, Sonics face  
has lost all its smart looking it has in the cartoon. He has _lots_ of  
quills starting directly from both sides of his head instead of only one  
single row on his back. Furthermore, everything looks very superficially  
drawn.

Have you seen the first three Sonic comics pencilled by Scott Shaw! ?
Now _THAT_ is what I would call _real_ artwork that can stand the  
competition with the artwork from the cartoon. For example, compare the  
'Tails solo story' from 'Sonic In Your Face Special' to the ending part of  
'Princess Sallys crusade' from the same comic. Maybe you will notice the  
difference.

Sorry, but this is my opinion. If you think otherwise, please tell me your  
arguments.

I hope you are right with this. I don't like this mixup eighter. It is

show.

Yes, it was me who mentioned this. I _have_ checked the manual, and the  
name listed there is _Amy Rose_. She is also called Amy in the comic  
adaption of this game from Fleetway Publications ('The Sonic Terminator',  
issue #26 - #28, a thrilling and well-drawn story full of action).

I bought my 'Sonic CD' game in 1993, it is for use with PAL and French  
SECAM Mega-CD systems. On the package you can see the heads of Metal Sonic  
(on the left) and Sonic (on the right) staring at each other.

Ok, I admit it: its not the newest version of the CD game and it also  
might not be the same version as they sell it in America. But how should I  
have known?

Could you check out the ending part of Zone 1 in the version you are  
referring to? Is the character who is trying to hug Sonic at the end of  
this level a pink hedgehog lady in a green dress (Amy) or a brownish  
squirrel with red hair (Sally)? Please let me know.

Best wishes

Yow!  More fans of Scott Shaw!  Everyone seems to love this guy.

I slipped this in an earlier e-mailing but it was so obscure that I 
suspect nobody has seen it.  Does anyone out there have (or can get) 
issue #3 of the original Sonic 4-part Miniseries [#0-#3].  Archie Comics 
was offering back-issues but were out of that one (and that's the only 
one I still need)  If so, please e-mail me.

Fred,

The latter sounds like a description of the cyborg-Sonic from Sonic #11
("The good, the bad and the hedgehog") who reprised in Sonic #19 ("Night
of a thousand Sonics").

I also love the artwork by Scott Shaw!  Heh... I like the artistic style
of Art Mwhinney(sp)!  He's so inspirational.  To date, I have drawn over
300 sketches -- most of them pencilled sketches , of both Sonic and Tails.
I have successfully drawn Knuckles, Sally, Rotor(in full color), and am
going to work on more characters, especially NED from the latest STH GG game.

In the American version of the manual, the character is named Princess 
Sally, even though she bears no resemblance to the Princess Sally in the 
American cartoons and comic; she looks like a pink hedgehog in a bobbysox 
outfit.  I haven't seen the British comic, so I wouldn't know for sure, 
but I suspect this is the character to which you refer when you say "Amy 
Rose".  (Personally, I think it was silly to rename the character for 
this side of the pond, but that's IMHO.)

The American cover's a bit different; if I recall, it depicts Sonic and 
RoboSonic leaping for a Time Gem (sort of like the faceoff in basketball) 
and a UFO (from the bonus round) exploding.

By asking on the list and finding out.  (:3  Now you know.  And I know 
not to assume that just because you don't live in Japan means you have 
the same versions of Sonic we do (I already knew there were some 
differences in the Japanese vs. American versions of the games).

Actually, it's a pink hedgehog lady in a green dress (Sally).  Just to be 
extra confusing, I guess.  (:3

Okay, just so we're clear on this (since not everyone here will have 
played all the games):

The MetalSonic in Sonic 2 is two to three times Sonic's height, entirely
gray, and looks rather like a pile of scrap metal welded into a shape
vaguely resembling Sonic.  It does a rocket-assisted rush, a spinning
leap, and a variant on the leap where it shoots spikes.  I don't remember 
what the eyes look like, but I think they're black with red dots.

The RoboSonic in Sonic CD is Sonic's height, colored blue and gray, and 
looks like what you'd get if Sonic were a Terminator and you burned all 
the skin off.  He's got Sonic's attitude, though he's a little slower (he 
flies with a jetpack instead of running) and can shoot sparks out of 
himself as a defense or surround himself with a fireball-like flame as an 
offensive charge.  His eyes are hollow sockets.

The MetalSonic in Sonic & Knuckles is about half again Sonic's height,
colored blue and black with a gold 'belt buckle', and is a really
evil-looking windtunnel-styled bot with a single eyeslot (sorta like the
Cylons, or KITT).  He can do the spindash, a rocket slide (points first),
and spinning jumps; Sonic also has to fight him in reprises of the
wrecking ball boss (Sonic 1, Green Hill Zone) and illusion boss (Sonic 2,
Metropolis Zone), while Knuckles has to fight him after he's been powered
up by the Master Emerald, which means he can fly, shoot energy discharges,
and dive down quickly to catch him by surprise. 

So which of these three does the version in the comic most closely 
resemble?  And what's the basic gist of the plots in which it's appeared?

No. August Ferdinand Mobius was a German mathematician who lived 1790 -1868.
I'm not sure what his claim to fame is, but I'm sure you can find out from
sources at your local library.

You know, a friend of mine has always said that nothing is illegal until 
someone complains.

Actually, as a veteran writer of stories using other people's characters, 
particularly of Sonic stories, I know that there are two basic rules you 
must follow when you're going to post such stories publicly.

(1) You MUST acknoledge the fact that parts of the story (i.e. characters, 
plots, etc.) are borrowed from someone else.  Preferably at the beginning 
of the story.

(2) You MUST NOT ask for nor accept any type of compensation for your 
story (i.e. money, cash, etc).  If you do, the original authors will 
almost surly get ticked off at you for making a profit at their expense.

One other thing, even though you use someone else's characters, it's 
important to place a copyright notice in your story that identifies you 
as the original author of that particular work.  That way, if SEGA or 
whoever reads your story and likes it and wants to turn it into a movie, 
they'll pay whoever can prove that the story is their's.  A copyright 
notice will help.

If you would like some examples, please feel free to read one of my 
stories which are available at either of the sites listed in my signature.

If you don't have access to FTP or WWW, let me know and I'll mail you one 
or two.

Not including any artwork will help a lot.  The idea of a very fast 
hedgehog who eats chili dogs is not legally protectable.  Likewise, the 
idea of a fox with two tails and can fly is not legally protectable.  As 
long as you don't lift anything from existing stories and don't use any 
of the characters' visual appearances, an ASCII story will not have done 
anything to run afoul of the copyright laws.  You can even use the plot 
of an existing story (like Tails telling Sonic-Con attendees he battled 
Robotnik when he did not) as long as your telling of the plot is original.
All you've used, then, is the idea.

I don't even want to touch trademark law....

I did take a copyright law course; however, this message is not to be

That's technically not true, but let's not open that pandora's box.

I think it's only right to give credit where credit is due.  But don't 
think a "Copyright and TM Walt Disney" notice will get you off the hook 
if you start selling Mickey Mouse T-shirts without a license from Disney.

That may help you get a "Fair Use" ruling in court, but lack of a profit 
motive is not a complete defence in an infringement suit.  But as you 
say, a profit motive present will likely eliminate any chance the 
owner(s) will choose to ignore what is technically an infringement.

As long as your work was created on or after 1/1/78, you automatically 
get copyright protection for whatever portion is yours, even if the work 
is ruled infringing in court.  A copyright notice is very prudent.  It is 
also prudent to register your work within five years with the Copyright 
Office so you will have prima facie evidence if you are the plaintiff in 
an infringement suit (and you must register to file suit at all).

Mobius' claim to fame is the Mobius Strip (no, it's not a suggestive
dance  ;-)  ).  To make your own, take a strip of paper and glue it into
a circle, putting a twist in it at the same time.  

Now, if you draw a line on one side of the paper, and keep drawing it,
you'll soon meet the line where it started.  In effect, you've been
working with a one-sided object: something with three dimensions yet
only one side!  There's another variation of this concept known as the
Klein Bottle...but we'll leave it at that for now.

BTW: in "Blast to the Past" Part 1, the device on the "royal signet"
Sally is wearing is a serpent looped in a figure-8 about to bite its own
tail -- a close enough heraldic representation of a Mobius strip.

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS

Welcome to the only mailing list that's way past cool  -- Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In this mailing list, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@sard.mv.net.
There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read
them before posting to the list.  They can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as faq-dd and faq-jf.  See "How to
Retrieve Files" below.

This list is archived, and the archive can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as a file, just like the FAQ's.  The
filename to request is mail.txt.  There are a few other Sonic-
related files, mostly clips from the archive, that you can
retrieve as well.

Let's all try to not get bogged down in rules and policies.  You
may post information and opinions related to the characters and
stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  If you feel you must flame someone (other than
Robotnik (g)), please do so in mail directly to that person.  And
as on most areas of the 'net, legally obscene material and posts
of a commercial nature are not welcome here.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

How To Retrieve Files
---------------------
To get a list of files you can retrieve, send this text to
majordomo@sard.mv.net:
    index sonic
    end
Once you have the filename of the file(s) you want, retrieve them
by sending this text to majordomo@sard.mv.net:
    get sonic file1.txt
    get sonic file2.txt
    end
Use one "get" line for each file you want.


Many thanks to Ratman (Paul Hurley) for giving us a virtual Knothole.

FTP SITE
--------
There is a ftp site to go along with this list.  Just ftp to
ftp.mv.com and go to /pub/users/rat/sonic.  Upload files to
/pub/users/rat/incoming.  Sounds and images are welcome.  Older
archive files may be available here in the future.

Other Internet Resources
------------------------
rec.games.video.sega
    A Usenet group for discussion of Sonic the Hedgehog and other
    games from SEGA.  Use r.g.v.s instead of this mailing list if
    you want to discuss the Sonic games, get codes/cheats, etc.
alt.sega.genesis
    Another Usenet group for discussing SEGA's games.
rec.arts.animation
    A Usenet group for discussion of animated cartoons.  Please
    read that group's FAQ before posting there.
alt.binaries.pictures.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting image files related to cartoons.
    This group is not widely propogated.
alt.toon-pics
    This Usenet group was supposed to be replaced by a.b.p.c but
    some sites continue to carry a.t.p too/instead.
alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting digitized sound files related to
    cartoons.  This group is not widely propogated.
Veronica
    Try looking up the word "hedgehog" and a *few* Sonic files
    should turn up.  Most of what you'll find will not be at all
    related to Sonic.
ftp
    Another ftp site is ftp.primenet.com, then cd /users/r/rotor.
    This has the same files as the Web site below.
WWW
    Sega has a home page (http://www.segaoa.com/), but you won't
    find much information there, but have your credit card
    ready (g).  Another home page is http://www.primenet.com/~rotor.
    You'll find some Sonic stories there.


Juice time, outta here!

Good eye!  I've been trying to find another meaning besides the 
aforementioned strip
and mathematician, but that may very well be the answer to my question...

Amen, my friend!  I've always enjoyed Scot Shaw's artwork.  His
characters are full of spunk and his style is unmistakable!  Great
to see him on the Sonic team at Archie.  Anyone remember Captain Carrot?
 Anybody?  

I remember mentioning before about how good Art Mawhinney's
art is on the Sally Solo stories.  I wanted to mention that Dave Manak's
style is good when one is in the mood for the surrealism
some issues find themselves spiraling in!  And when Manak draws Sally when
she gets mad---Ooooo!  Clear the room!  She can look down right nasty!  =D

Later, fellow sonic fans!

Will it be live action or cartoon? And who thinks it would be better as a live

then was done to mario bros. Just my 2 cents. What do you think?

Here's whats available from that merch store in my area I mentioned
upthread.  There shouldn't be any problems finding this gear
throughout most of Australia or New Zealand...

(There wasn't any Sally or Bunnie merchandise, sob. :~(


      o Drink bottles (of the attach-to-bicycle-frame persuasion) --
	robust looking plastic moulding printed with a STH banner and
	two pictures of Sonic-- one a typical running pose, the other of
	him reclining in a sun chair wearing dark glasses.  Mnf by ???
	Made in Australia.  (AU$8)


      o Bike helmets -- made from expanded polystyrene and a ?thin
	plastic shell covered with multiple pictures of Sonic lifting
	weights.  Available in sizes SM/M and with a black or white
	background.  Mnf. by "Headstart"; AS 2063 certifed; AU$45
	(that's close to what I paid for my "real" helmet..)


      o T-Shirts (Wow, an entire rack devoted to Sonic :) All to fit
	sizes M to L, full colour, and made of cotton.  With only one
	exception were priced at AU$30 (give or take 5 cents..)

        1) Front: Large portrait of Sonic doing that "standard" pointing
	pose, with the rest of the black cotton shirt covered (all over)
	in a dark yellow collage of scenes from the ?original video game.
	Back: cheesy rear view of same.  Size M; Mnf. by "Top Heavy" (a
	Sydney company); cost AU$40.  My Unobjective Opinion: Very nice.

	2) A black cotton T-Shirt -- small picture of Sonic "in action"
	over the pocket area w/ "Sonic" banner underneath.  Mnf. Acme.
	[Btw, this and the rest of the shirts are from Acme's "SEGA Mega
	Wear" line.]  MUO: Not worth it unless you're into subtlety.

	3) Black cotton 'shirt with warm yellow and orange picture of a
	combat ?troll poking his head out from a tank on the front.
	Large banner with "Pretend its a Game" in faux-bitmap text on
	back.  [Prolly not Hedgehog related, but mnf. by Acme..]  MUO:
	Nice gift for a vidgame freak..

	4) Black cotton shirt with several faux-bitmapped Sonics to show
	him running about (the final and largest pic with his arms
	folded) with the banner "Think Fast".  MUO: Not great.

	5) Black or white cotton shirt with the canonical "Sonic 2"
	portrait (with Tails) and S2 banner.  MUO: Good

	6) Black cotton shirt with a "television's eye view" of Sonic
	frantically playing with a game controller.  Exaggerated
	comic-eqsue line work by "Brad".  MUO: A biiittt over-priced..


(Notice how the amount of detail declines as you go down the list. :)
Anyone wanna donate a Photo-CD camera so I can use pictures here
instead? :)

Btw,, about the _only_ overseas manufacture that imports to
Australia is Applause-- there might be a chance of a Tails plushie
will come my way yet.. :) We get the Archie comics over here too;
the local newsagent has SH#19 and IYF for sale at the moment.

If someone does make a movie, I would hope it would be a cartoon. Live action
would look way too corny. Just really good animation would be refereshing.
And maybe new characters. Probably won't be done, but it's good to imagine..

If there's a God in Heaven, PLEASE!!!! don't let it be a live action
film!  Maybe it worked with TMNT, but that's about it.  Anyone remember
"Howard the Duck?"  George Lucas directing, $40 million and STILL the
thing was more turkey than duck!  To quote another toon: "Spew and a
half!"  

'Nuff said.

     The name of the snake bitings its own tail escapes
me, but it's considered a sign of infinity, roughly
equivilant to the moebius strip itself, and more
importantly a sign of the cyclical and closed nature of
time itself.  A symbol for the episode, perhaps?  Hard
to tell with this show, sometimes.

Besides, how in the world could they do it?  "Howard the Duck" involved
one animal character, and TMNT involved 5.  This would be an entire planet!
(or at least a city, depending on how in depth they want to show this
place).

I vote animation.  I know it's too much to hope for when I say I want
story-telling along the lines of "Watership Down" (BTW, just bought the
book!), so here's hoping they'll at least treat it the way Bluth did "The
Secret of NIMH".

Which raises a whole plethora of new questions:

1).  How would the movie be set in with the TV show/comic book?

Would you want a prequel (maybe telling the story of Robotnik's initial
take-over and how all the characters came to be where they are), an alternate
story (sorta like "TMNT" or "Batman" or just about any other super-hero
movie), or perhaps a continuation of the cartoon (assuming the show doesn't
get renewed)?  The "prequel" is probably the least likely, since nowadays
movies have to have a definite ending, and preferably a happy one.

2).  Who would do the voices?

Should we keep Jaleel and the rest of the gang, or take this opportunity
to expose some bigger names (Tim Curry notwithstanding) to the Sonic universe?
Not that I'm trying to dismiss any of the Sat. morning stars.  I still have
yet to see any of 'em myself!

3).  Who would produce the movie?

If Bluth were still making movies the way he used to, I'd want him in a
heartbeat, but lately he seems burnt-out ("Thumbelina"?)  Disney making
it would be a double-edged sword; sure the animation would be top-notch,
but the story might be a little too Hollywood.  And I don't want these
guys singing when there is a global war going on! :-)  What if a Japanese
company did it--Sonic anime?  That would be cool!!

And, of course, we could get really nit-picky and discuss who we want
for writer, music (orchestral, electronic, or pop?), music composer, etc.

okay, it's debate time!

later---Kris

I agree, but if they do a movie out of sonic, I hope they have a good story 
to do it with.  Too many animated features have been coming out lately with 
stories that are nothing but concepts.  And hopefully they wouldn't base it 
on the weekday show.  Maybe something on the lines of; what happens now that 
Robotnic is gone...or is he?

(Dan: have you got any of my messages?  I haven't heard from you.)

Brad:

WHAT MESSAGES?

I suppose that answers your question.  I told Craig that I hadn't heard
from you since early last week.  At least we can stay in touch here!

Totally agree about stories.  Bluth was seriously crippled in that
department with "All Dogs..." and "Rock-A-Doodle."  His plotlines were
all over the highway.  And that's probably the reason why the recent
Disney features have been so strong: Jeff Katzenberg was in the habit of
pushing the writers until a story went into "meltdown" and completely
fell apart; then they'd take the leftover core and rebuild around it.
Tad Stones has been keeping Disney Afternoon list subscribers up to date
on the process as it concerns the next Aladdin direct to video.  And
over in r.a.a, Mark Evanier has said that time for writing is a luxury
that a lot of TV animation shows can't afford, since any extra time
spent writing is time taken away from the animators.  That's the
business for ya.

Okay, everyone slow down for a minute and picture this . . .

A computer animated Sonic movie produced and directed by Steven Speilberg.

I know it may soon outragous, but the fact is that spielberg has been 
trying his hand lately at animated films, and, if he could get animation 
quality like in Jurassic Park, we'd have a blockbuster movie that would 
win best picture in no time at all.

I know this may be a little off topic, but, since we seem to be talking 
about Don Bluth . . .

I heard recently, from a reliable source, that Don Bluth is thinking 
about re-releasing "The Secret of NIMH".  This is because it originally 
didn't get the wide publicity he wanted it to.  In fact, the word is that 
MGM/UA walked all over it and treated it like some Tom and Jerry cartoon 
short.

Well, I think that it SHOULD be from the tv show and not the comic book. It
would be nice if they did a new story. As for the voices, I would keep all of
the voices and add new characters. There really is no way that disney will do
it because they stick to there own stuff so unless they buy sonic, then they
won't do it. Maybe DIC will do it or maybe we can get scott shaw (SP) from the
mini-series to do some of it. I just hope that they DO make a movie. I havn't
heard anything about it other then the little note in the comic book. Maybe
someone out there knows more about it?

     So be it!  I will descend with joyous abandon into
the depths of idiotic speculation.  Specifically, I'll
say that if they do make a Sonic movie I would rather
it be made in the format of the Kimagure Orange Road
movie - the last, extra-long episode of the series.
Where they finally and for good squash Robotnik and
answer most of the questions on what they're going to
do afterwards.  I have grown very attached to the world
that the Saturday Morning series has created, and the
characters that inhabit it, and eventually would like
to see a conclusion - as long as it were well done.
     As for who to do it, I personally would be in
favor of Spielberg.  He has a habit of finding talented
people, and some of the names he has already in his
Amblimation are impressive.  Although... the anime idea
is actually not very far fetched.  Aren't Sally,
Bunnie, and the rest of the secondary characters
modeled off of a manga?  I thought that was why the
colors took so long to get straight in the comics.  I'd
be rather pleased to see a Sonic anime movie, if for no
other reason than curiosity over how they handled it,
and the hope of seeing the serious character issues
treated seriously and at length.  It's interesting to
watch Bunnie and Dulcy give little hints about their
feelings in the background, but I'd like more.

I meand re-release, as in the original film.  I also mean in movie 
theaters.  He hopes to get a better audience and maybe it won't flop as 
bad as it did in '82.  I also mean, that he's still THINKING about it, it 
may happen or it may not.  That's all I know.

Personally, it would be great if he did.

Kinda figured it was just a "re-release", tho' I too would love to get
a chance to see it in the theatre.  When did come out originally, '81, '82?
I was too young!

BTW, since many of us appear to be NIMH fans as well as Sonic fans, just
in case you don't know, there is a book sequel to _Mrs. Frisby_ titled
_Racso and the Rats of NIMH_.  It tells the story of a young rat named
Racso who hears of the Thorn Valley colony and vows to go there so he
can learn how to read and write and become something.  Now how, you ask,
could he have heard of the Rats of NIMH, let alone possess the ability
and determination to learn how to read?  Sorry, that would be a spoiler...:-)

The story itself is great, but the book suffers from many glaring 
incontinuities from the first book (sound familiar?).  It almost seems like
the author (it wasn't O'Brien) read the original book once and then lost
it before deciding to write a sequel.  Oh well...

later---Kris

Uh oh, that's like 4 messages in the thread off topic. We're going to get 
complains any time soon. If this conversation keeps up, I'll have to 
create another mailing list. ;-)

Here's the facts. There were 3 books.

1971 - "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIHM" by Robert C. O'Brien
1986 - "Racso and the Rats of NIMH" by Jane Leslie Conly
1990 - "R-T, Margaret, and the Rats of NIHM" by Jane Leslie Conly

R-T, Margaret, and the Rats of NIHM wasn't that great, but it had rats in 
it, so I enjoyed it.

Both the ones by Jane Leslie Conly did. They were definately children's
books. 
But the first book by O'Brien was really awesome! It was different than the
movie in so many ways, it was a different story! Did anybody else get that
feeling? 

I seem to remember having this conversation in rec.arts.animation... Oh 
well.

** Ok, here's a spoiler. I'm going to talk about the the first book


[ scroll down a lot ]












































Ok, here's some main differences that many people might not know.

- Jenner was a good guy. Totally. He just didn't agree with Nicodemus's 
  idea to move to thorn valley, and took off. Didn't cause any trouble.
- Mr. Ages was polite.
- They described in more detail their experience at NIMH.
- They succeed in moving Mrs. Frisby's cinderblock home. Note the name 
  difference.

I think everyone knows what a Mobius Strip looks like...

As far as I remember my days at school there was also a German zoologist  
called Karl August Mobius (1825 - 1908). With his studies about oysters he  
founded the theory of the community of life (hope I translated it right).

After all, this seems to fit perfectly because Mobius _is_ a planet where  
different sorts of animals live together in peace and in balance with  
nature (not to mention that the name of the planet was choosen way before  
the episode 'Blast To The Past'.)

Just a suggestion

Well, I'm sorry that I _can't_ agree. Have you ever compared Art Mawhinneys
drawings to the looking of the characters in the cartoon? I believe there
are a lot of differences (and not to the best).

[theme song deleted]

I would really like to hear this song. The one on my 'Sonic CD' game is  
different, maybe I have another version. Here is the text of the song as I  
know it:

[snip]

10-10 Y'can go again
9-9 Don't fall behind
8-8 Say, don't be late
7-7 Destination heaven
6-5 So stay alive
4-3 Now it's you & me
2-1 We're gonna have some fun
Excalibar - It's not that far
What do y'make - Hey Give & Take
Goin' Home - Time Zone
Check out Egg - He's never alone
Leather'n Lace - Getting in Place
What do y'get - Say - Fast Jet
Doom Room - Cosmic Zoom
Heads up Jake
It's a Sonic Boom
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Toot Toot Sonic Warrior
Your hour is never at hand
You've got the power to save the land
Take a little chance - slip on thru,
You 'gotta survive no matter what you do you gotta do for you
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Toot Toot Sonic Warrior
The power is on your mind
To shake the planets and conquer time
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Deep in Space and Time
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - forever in your mind
Nothing can survive, the will to stay alive,
cause if you try, you can do anything
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Always takes a chance
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Never says he can't
Nothing can survive, the will to stay alive,
cause if you try, you can do anything.

[snap]

I could also send this song as a sampeled VOC-file (or whatever you like)
if you want it. Please tell me the required sampling rate, mono or stereo,
the sound format (.VOC would be best) and a FTP-site to send it to
(an UUENCODED file would be a little too big, but it can be done).

Best wishes

There was a Sonic robot in issue #9 of the Sonic comic from Archie. I
couldn't get this issue, so I don't know any details.

The Metal Sonic from the 'Sonic CD' game had an appearance in the Sonic
comic from Fleetway Publications, issue #21 - #23, 'The Sonic Terminator'
(last three parts of a six-part story).

Basically, the story has a lot of the CD game in it.

[snip]

Issue #21:
Sonic receives a distress signal sent by Amy (a pink lady hedgehog) from
Never Lake. When Sonic gets there he finds the Little Planet completely
covered with Robotniks factories and chained to Mobius with a gigantic
chain. While saving Amy he is attacked by Metal Sonic but is able to defeat
him. Just when things seem to be back to normal and Sonic does his usual
jokes (Sonic: "Did I ever tell you that pink is my most _non-favourite_
color?" Amy: "Oh Sonic, you say the cutest things!") Metal Sonic gets up
again and hits Sonic from behind. Because its systems are severly damaged,
Metal Sonic takes Amy to the Little Planet as 'life bait' for Sonic. Sonic
follows them over the chain that holds the Little Planet.

Issue #22:
Sonic finds Amy and tries to defeat Metal Sonic, but his enemy is itself
a part of the technology that covers the Little Planet. So it can drain
energy from the surrounding machinery to repair itself. Just as Metal
Sonic is about to finish Sonic, it gets hit by another Sonic who is only
half the size of the original. He then pushes Sonic into a shrinking ray
and hands him a Time Stone.

Issue #23:
With the Time Stone Sonic travels back into the past and finds the machine
that caused the changes on the Little Planet. Because of his small size
he is able to enter the machine and destroy it from within. He travels
back to the present just in time to prevent Metal Sonic from doing the  
kill. He hands over the Time Stone to his other self and sends him back  
into time. Due to the changes in the past the Little Planet is returned to
normal. The Metal Sonic disappears too, because he was created by the same
machinery.

[snap]

Another example for my bad grammar... oh well. Hope you can find out
what was meant.

Well, I don't know the story in issue #9 of the American Sonic comic,
but thinking of all the sh*t I've seen from Archie so far with all the
slapstick and uninspired drawing styles, I assume that the English
version is a little more interesting. (Too bad you haven't seen the
'Enter Knuckles' story from Fleetway. Definitely _way_ better than the
Archie comics version 'This Island Hedgehog'.)

Only my opinion... don't flame me, I'm nobody's toast.

Hello.

I saw something interesting in the FAQ file that was recently posted by
Dan Drazen:

>      B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
>
> #18 [Jan 1995]:
> :
>      Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
> fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Believe it or not, this letter from Germany was mine (one of many others
I wrote). However, Archie Comics stated that they think of Dave Manak as
a very talented and inspirated penciller, and another reader said on the
Sonic-Grams page in issue #21 that he thinks exactly the same as Archie
Comics and likes the current style of drawing.

Well, the only high-quality artwork _I_ ever saw in the Sonic comics was
the one done by Scott Shaw! in the Sonic mini-series #0 - #2 and in the
Sonic In Your Face Special #1 ('Tails Little Tale').

Now I would like to find out if I'm right about the very low quality of
the current artwork or if I'm just a stupid German. Whoever is reading
this, could you please tell me what _you_ think of the works of Dave
Manak, Art Mawhinney and all the other morons?

Just my opinion - don't send flames

A movie would be great, but I have the same fears about it as I do seeing
a 3rd season (God willing)... Because of the differences in all the 
different Sonic
books, shows, and comic books (discussed @ nauseum here), who will decide 
what is the TRUE story behind Robotnik's takeover, the Freedom Fighter's 
individual
struggles, etc.?  Also, since Sonic is owned (TM and all) by SEGA, but the 
cartoon
is produced in the U.S.A., couldn't SEGA create a whole NEW story?  It may
have nothing to do with anything ever written or animated so far...

We've already seen the destruction of everything Robotnik built (cue "Doomsday")
and witnessed most of the individual battles up until that point, so what 
could the Movie possibly deal with?  Assuming Robotnik would have to be in 
the movie, and assuming that some sort of background to this conflict 
between him & Sonic would
have to be exposed, and finally assuming that the producers won't repeat 
anything from the show, I can forsee one of 2 things happening:

1)the story will be completely changed - new reasons for the war (against 
Robotnik) -
        new and different characters - new voices/animation 
        This, in effect, would discredit anything produced so far in the 
shows/comic/
        books. (along with the FAQ  ;) )
2)it will keep the current SatAM version's characteristics, but will only tell
        a story that is very generic (like a few of the shows) giving no 
insight into the            character development, plot line, etc. which 
would (IMHO) be the whole point of         seeing the movie! 

Of course, I COULD be wrong - the movie might actually work to resolve all 
of the
problems that we have been talking about between the comic/books/show...
(i.e. you will finally see that I'm right - Sally is a vixen) (I don't care 
how many [more] flames I get on this topic - my mind is made up & It will 
take...well...a movie to change it   ;)  )

It's only sorta cool, and actually is never heard in the format I posted
it (there's one mix used for the title screen and opening animation and
another for the closing animation).  I understand the Japanese version is 
completely different; anyone out there have the lyrics for *that*?  (:3

That's what I suspect; I guess there were three releases after all 
(American, European English, and Japanese)-- unless someone's seen a 
German Sonic...  (:3

Erg.  And I thought the American lyrics were banal.  (:3

Don't threaten *me*.  (:3  Seriously, though, thanks for sharing these 
little 'quirks'.  It's interesting to learn more about my primary sources 
for info about Sonic (as I've said earlier, I don't read the comic much 
and can't see the show often).

What were the first three parts, pray tell?  (Curious look-- this British

"De gustibus non est disputandum,*" Al. [*That's Latin.]  Still, let me
throw in my own 2 pfennigs:

I got into the Sonic comics late, starting with issue #18.  As a result,
I only have Shaw!'s contribution to the In Your Face issue to go by.

While Shaw! has a good style, it seems to me to be rather "light" and
that it works mainly in comedic situations.  Of course it's light years
beyond Manak.

Still, getting back to #18, I have a hard time picturing Shaw! drawing
"In The Still Of The Night," especially the scenes toward the end where
Sally's old mentor, Julayla, is on her deathbed.  IMHO, Art Mawhinney
has the right touch for the more "serious" episodes.  It's not hard to
figure out why, as he's credited as being a storyboard artist for the
animated series...both of them, in fact.  Have to roll tape to see if
the same can be said for Shaw!

Not a flame, just my own outlook.

I also would love to see a Sonic movie; what they have begun with
the Saturday morning show begs for more.  The world it has created in Mobius
suggests a rich and ancient culture that would be well worth exploring.  The
characters are easy to identify with and you can really care about them and
long to know more about them.  Many questions come to mind; exactly how did
Robotnik come to power, what was the great war all about (did all the animals
live in peace and harmony OR did they have great growing pains and conflict
to achieve their happiness and coexistence?)  And, of course, when Robotnik
(or whoever comes after him) is finally crushed, what brave new world will
our new royal family of Queen Sally and King Sonic build out of the ashes?
 Yes, all of this begs a movie, a trilogy, or even a series!  You hear us,
Mr. Spielberg?  :D

This is one of the few book-to-movie conversions I've seen where the
stories were radically changed, and yet both book AND movie are superb!
Tom Clancy or Anne Rice should be so lucky!

I don't know..... I found non-animated Flintstones visually shocking.  
Combined with the different voices, it was all such a distraction that it 
was impossible for me to allow the Flintstones movie to be what it is.  
If the StH movie is going to be animated, I hope DIC will take advantage 
of a pre-established audience and, using contractors where necessary, 
make a first-rate product that will show the world what they can do if 
they really want to.  That can help them bring in sales revenue and 
capital to hire better writers, artists, and animators and expand 
production capability.  They won't become a Warner Bros. overnight, but 
this can be the beginning of moving from minor to major studio status.

Recycling is good, but, really, is "Captain Planet" the stuff classic 
animation is made of?  Or what about "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" 
(which I don't actually have access to without buying the tapes)?

I can't comment on the Mario Bros.; I've not seen that movie.

I was thinking about buying it. I borrowed it from the library and read it
awhile ago.

Oh man! I totally forgot about that one! You're right! And I don't 
remember any "stone", but I do remember the "You can open any door if you 
have the key" quote from Jonathan.

True! The ones by Conly might not be good enough for most people, but I liked
it. One of em' even has this neat picuture of a rat standing behind a

Live action movies have covered large geographic areas before.

I think DIC would be one of or the prodcution company/ies, and they would 
probably not want to get too far off the existing cartoon.  And I think 
much of the audience would expect an extension of the TV cartoon.

It should begin with a brief exposition of Robotnik's coup to make sure 
the audience all know the information they need (and create sympathy for 
the "good guys").  Open with a high-action scene that will grab 
everyone's attention and raise the tension high.  When the audience can't 
take any more, fade to black, pause a few frames, and fade in to the 
present.  Time:  around five minutes.  No credits over this scene!  For 
those credits that must be shown early, show some vista shots and play 
some suspense-building music.  Resume credits if necessary after fading 
back to the present.

We really can't have Robotnik KIA or that would close the story once and 
for all, unless someone else replaces him at/near the end.  But I don't 
think a cliffhanger would be appropriate for the movie.  Don't make him 
turn good either (no sugar-coated movie, please).  I'm not sure what 
would make a good ending, but it lies somewhere between those points.

Isn't it starting to look like the Sonic mailing list will be writing the 
script?  :-)

It should be mostly the same, so as not to shock and distract the 
audience.  Add a new character or two (but carefully, to preserve 
believability and overall story integrity) with a bigger name.  Due to the 
length of the movie, a new character might help quite a bit.

I could see Disney farming that out to Touchstone considering Buena Vista 
distributes the video cassettes.  But I'm not sure about how much 
experience Touchstone has with animation, but I think they would handle 
the writing better than Disney.  DIC should have a more-than-mere-token role 
too.

For continuity, some music like that in the existing cartoons and the 
games should be used, preferably with a budget to get bigger-name 
songwriters and performers.  Pop can make the movie dated quickly, so be 
careful there.  I think some well-written and performed electronic music 
with some acoustic instruments would work nicely.  Don't make the 
electronic part draw attention to itself.  Find some quality songwriters who 
already know the story well and have them really show what they can do.

Something terrible has happened.

This morning, I was reading the new entries in Toon talk on America 
On-line, and, in a folder for the dicussions of new fall shows, I read 
something that I found unbeleiveable.

Someone was talking about an an article they had read that outlined the 
new Saturday morning line-up. They talked about new shows and old show, 
and, according to the article, Sonic the Hedgehog has NOT been renewed.

This article appeared in something called "Rutger News" which I think is 
the campus newspaper for Rutgers University, correct me if I'm wrong.  I 
don't know where they got their information, but Sonic the Hedgehog was not 
listed in the new fall line-up.

Is there a positive side to this?  I like to think so.  If they don't 
forget about Sonic altogether, there's two places they could go with this.
(1) Syndication -- Imagine being able to see great episodes every weekday
Yes, I know they already made one, but it stinks.

(2) movie -- They could just launch into the movie from the end of "The 
Doomsday Project"

They might be wrong.  It would be nice if they were.  I guess we really 
won't know until ABC gets their ads for the fall season going near the 
middle of Summer.  Oh well.

     Well, let's start - Jeffrey Pegnato mentioned a
couple of things I'd like to put my commentary on.  1)
The destruction of everything Robotnik built - sorry,
guy, but they got the headquarters, and maybe a few
buildings around it, and they think they got Robo.
Probably squashed a lot of swatbots in the process.
Unfortunately, 'bots still roll off the assembly line,
as loyal roboticized workers continue to do their jobs.
Unless the freedom fighters move fast, they'll be
waiting for Snively when he gets back to town.  If they
hadn't actually gotten Robo, at least temporarily, it
would be nothing more than a major annoyance to him.
2) Sally the vixen?  Actually... anybody taken a good
look at her father?  That's a fox tail - and nothing
like her little ground squirrel appendage.
     Bluth!  I'll just leave it that I felt he brutally
mutilated the book's story, but everything else was
great.
     Artwork!  I have to say that Scott Shaw's is my
favorite from what I've seen of the comic, but really
as far as I know all I've seen him do is that Tails
story.  On the other hand, Tails's expressions in that
are my favorite moments in the entire comic run, except
possibly for some of the stuff being set up in Princess
Sally.  Shaw doesn't have the precision that makes
Sonic actually look GOOD on the cartoon, but his work
is very cute, and his expressions are... well,
expressive!
     How to finish Robo - actually, I always figured
that when the freedom fighters figured they actually
had enough of a chance to pick up the pieces afterwards
to actually go after him, he'd be roboticized in the
fight - and then, since if anybody's got enough
willpower to keep going aftwards it's him, he'd be
smashed, although perhaps not to the point of
irreparability, at least to helplessness.  It's how I'd
do it, and I am pleasantly surprised to find that they
frequently take the more artistic way for their
storylines.

Okay, King Aconr is a fox, and Sally is a ground squirrel.

How is it that they're father and daughter?  Presenting . . . 

DAVID PISTONE'S GUIDE TO CROSS BREEDING ON ANTHROPOMORPHIC WORLDS.
PART 1

NOTICE:  The following idea is NOT obsenely biological in any way,  at 
         least not in my opinion.

	On the many anthropomorphic worlds that, no doubt, exist in this 
universe, it is very likely that cross-breeding has become one of the 
many ways of life.  Yet, when we turn on an anthropomorphic cartoon, we 
often see creatures who, although they present themselves as being 
related, they are entirely different species, and we ask ourselves, "How 
is that possible.
	Well, I've always said this is a universe of possiblities, so 
here is one possible explanation.  For an example, two creatures on an 
anthropomorphic world, say a wolf and a rabbit, meet, fall in love and 
get married.  What, exactly, says what species the children will be.  
Here is my theory.
	Everyone knows that, in a developing egg, there is one chromosome 
that tells the egg whether it will be male or female.  It never says that 
the egg will be part one or part the other, it makes a definite choice.
	On an anthropomorphic world, I have reasoned that there is also a 
chromosome that tells the egg which species of the two parents it will be.
It doesn't say that the child will be part part one and part the other, it 
says the child will be one OR the other, exactly like the chromosome that 
determines the sex.
	Now, of course, our reproductive systems aren't that advanced.  
However, I think its reasonable to assume that, if given a chance, every 
race of creatures would evolve to that point of universal compatablity 
eventually.

	So, thats how Sally and here father are related.  I'd be willing 
to bet even money that Sally's mother was also a ground squirrel as well.

   Since there's already been voices assigned, it's not much  of a problem.

Whatever, Dave.  I just took the cheap way out and looked at the
"flashforward" ending of "Sally's Quest" from _In Your Face_#1:



Obligatory Spoiler Spacing:
























As depicted by Art Mawhinney, Sonic and Sally's offspring are miniatures
of themselves.  Whether or not gender and species are linked genetically
is speculative and, in this case, irrelevant.  It *can* be done, and
that's what matters to the plot as well as to this interminable
discussion ;-) .

First of all, I made a small error in this last post. The Metal Sonic  
appeared in issue #26 - #28 and the complete story has only five parts.

The first two parts tell how Captain Plunder and the Mystic Cave Pirates  
try to steal the Chaos Emeralds from Sonic.

> Thanks for the info!  I really appreciate it.  [We want information...]

Well, in general the comic has a lot of everything, even solo stories with  
Tails or Knuckles as the leading character or stories about Ecco The  
Dolphin, Shinobi, Eternal Champions, Wonderboy etc.

Oh my... I'll try my best:

The 'Enter Knuckles' story is in issue #33 - #34 with leads into
the 'Power Of The Chaos Emeralds' story in issue #35 - #36.

[snip]

Issue #33:
Dr. Robotnik has crash-landed with his space satellite Death Egg II on the  
Floating Island. Sonic & Tails fly to the island to search for him and  
finish him once and for all. After destroying some traps and battling some  
Badniks they meet Robotnik, who has already convinced Knuckles that Sonic  
is the bad guy who wants to steal the Floating Island Chaos Emeralds.

Issue #34:
Sonic & Knuckles have an excessive fight using everything they can offer   
(Sonic running in circles around Knuckles, Knuckles digging underground  
etc.). The fight ends to be a tie, but Tails is able to capture Robotnik
by throwing a net over him. Sonic & Tails escape with the captured  
Robotnik.

Issue #35:
Back at Sonics secret base, Porker Lewis tries to interrogate Robotnik.  
Suddenly Knuckles breaks into the cell to free the doctor. In this moment  
of confusion Robotnik takes Porker Lewis hostage and demands the Chaos  
Emeralds from Sonic. Sonic & Tails try to retrieve the stolen Chaos  
Emeralds from Robotnik and force him to crash land on the Floating Island.

Issue #36:
Again Sonic & Knuckles have a fight. Sonic pretends to be beaten but  
follows Knuckles and Robotnik secretly. Robotnik re-integrates the six  
Chaos Emeralds with the six on the Floating Island (that were once split  
into twelve). Sonic arrives just in time to see Robotnik absorbing the  
chaos energy to become invincible. Knuckles realizes that Robotnik lied to  
him and uses the Master Emerald which he kept hidden to regain control  
over the other emeralds. Robotnik is sent back to Mobius after his new  
powers have been removed. Sonic & Tails leave, Knuckles stays on the  
Floating Island to guard the emeralds.

[snap]

Why don't you order some issues yourself? They are definitely worth the  
money! Stories in a comic book should be read, not summarized. ,-)

Well, its not especially that the drawings are bad, its because IMHO some  
characters differ a lot from what they look like in the sathurday morning  
cartoon. Scott Shaw! had a very detailled way of doing his drawings, and  
he also knew perfectly how to use different perspectives to give the  
reader the feeling to be 'part of the story'.

Darn... I should've known I would be unable to explain all this in  
English... I really should go out and buy a dictionary.

> Not a flame, just my own outlook.

It's ok... but how about doing a quick comparsion between the Archie comic  
Sonic and the Sathurday morning TV Sonic? To draw the characters in a way  
they look like in the cartoon, _that's_ what I think Art Mawhinney (and  
the rest) is unable to do.

> Thanks for the info!  I really appreciate it.  [We want information...]

Well, in general the comic has a lot of everything, even solo stories with  
Tails or Knuckles as the leading character or stories about Ecco The  
Dolphin, Shinobi, Eternal Champions, Wonderboy etc.

Oh my... I'll try my best:

The 'Enter Knuckles' story is in issue #33 - #34 with leads into
the 'Power Of The Chaos Emeralds' story in issue #35 - #36.

[snip]

Issue #33:
Dr. Robotnik has crash-landed with his space satellite Death Egg II on the  
Floating Island. Sonic & Tails fly to the island to search for him and  
finish him once and for all. After destroying some traps and battling some  
Badniks they meet Robotnik, who has already convinced Knuckles that Sonic  
is the bad guy who wants to steal the Floating Island Chaos Emeralds.

Issue #34:
Sonic & Knuckles have an excessive fight using everything they can offer   
(Sonic running in circles around Knuckles, Knuckles digging underground  
etc.). The fight ends to be a tie, but Tails is able to capture Robotnik
by throwing a net over him. Sonic & Tails escape with the captured  
Robotnik.

Issue #35:
Back at Sonics secret base, Porker Lewis tries to interrogate Robotnik.  
Suddenly Knuckles breaks into the cell to free the doctor. In this moment  
of confusion Robotnik takes Porker Lewis hostage and demands the Chaos  
Emeralds from Sonic. Sonic & Tails try to retrieve the stolen Chaos  
Emeralds from Robotnik and force him to crash land on the Floating Island.

Issue #36:
Again Sonic & Knuckles have a fight. Sonic pretends to be beaten but  
follows Knuckles and Robotnik secretly. Robotnik re-integrates the six  
Chaos Emeralds with the six on the Floating Island (that were once split  
into twelve). Sonic arrives just in time to see Robotnik absorbing the  
chaos energy to become invincible. Knuckles realizes that Robotnik lied to  
him and uses the Master Emerald which he kept hidden to regain control  
over the other emeralds. Robotnik is sent back to Mobius after his new  
powers have been removed. Sonic & Tails leave, Knuckles stays on the  
Floating Island to guard the emeralds.

Why don't you order some issues yourself? They are definitely worth the  
money! Stories in a comic book should be read, not summarized. ,-)

Well, its not especially that the drawings are bad, its because IMHO some  
characters differ a lot from what they look like in the sathurday morning  
cartoon. Scott Shaw! had a very detailled way of doing his drawings, and  
he also knew perfectly how to use different perspectives to give the  
reader the feeling to be 'part of the story'.

Darn... I should've known I would be unable to explain all this in  
English... I really should go out and buy a dictionary.

> Not a flame, just my own outlook.

It's ok... but how about doing a quick comparsion between the Archie comic  
Sonic and the Sathurday morning TV Sonic? To draw the characters in a way  
they look like in the cartoon, _that's_ what I think Art Mawhinney (and  
the rest) is unable to do.

On the latter point, no contest, but I'd suggest the Fleetway is less
popular only because it is less well-known (I've never seen it,
certainly).  I think it's a European product; can our German native
confirm this, preferably with the publisher's address?

I've seen Tokyo Movie Shin(something or other)'s work on the best 
episodes of "Tiny Toon Adventures".  There's also been some anime work of 
Sonic done, for the game "Sonic CD", but I don't have the manual handy so 
don't know who did that.  Whoever's chosen in the end, though, should do 
better work than is even done in the Saturday episodes; when Sonic takes 
off, I want to feel like the camera's moving at a sizable fraction of the 
speed of sound.  (:3

This sounds quite interesting (even if Eternal Champions is said to 
'suck' and Wonderboy is ancient); I always thought there was a Zone 
somewhere off the coast of Mobius where Ecco's pod hangs out...  (:3  In 
fact, Ecco was one of the two games (the other was Lunar) that got me to 
buy a Sega.  But I digress...

I would if I could, but I can't so I won't.  (:3

Seriously, though, I've *never* seen an issue of this (and trust me, if I 
had I would have added it to my list of comics-to-buy); obviously this is 
not an American product.  Is there an address in the comic to which I can 
write to find out about back issues or the like?  Or does anyone 
State-side know if my comic shop will special-order stuff from Britain 
(the presumed easiest place to get them from-- do you buy yours in Germany?)

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
     C. OTHER SOURCES



I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  At this point, there is
no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're
pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer
the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution
of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails had not
been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.

Despite this statement, controversy continues.  Identifying
Sally's species has been particularly vexing to some fans,
especially those who reason that since Sally's father is clearly
a fox, then she must be one herself.  It is possible that Sally
takes after her mother in this regard more than her father. 
Cross-species mating is a definite possibility, and an example is
implied in the "flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade"
[Sonic: In Your Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified in the Sonic-Gram Extra, vol.  
1, no. 1, Winter 94-95; I am still trying to identify a first
usage of the name.  Technically, royalty do not have         
surnames or family names in the accepted sense; rather, the title
of the personage tends to serve the purpose.  Her middle name,
Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf. "Blast to the Past," part
1).  If you wanted to be grandiose about it, Sally's formal title
would be: Sally Alicia, Princess of the House of Acorn.  But in
any event it's unlikely that Sally's formal title will come back
into use so long as Robotnik is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
Presuming that the age of majority on Mobius is 18, that would
mean Sonic and Sally are both 16 years old, though the comics
reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the
number of years Robotnik has been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would
appear that Tails was born after the fall of the House of Acorn. 
Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma would be to put the
age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of 18; that would
eliminate the extra year differential without altering the stated
ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood
Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differs in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
features Geoffrey St. John, while another does not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  The
fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS Sega
reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series (as
reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to indicate
that someone had come down with a case of "creative differences."
In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began shipping the
week of Feb 13.

into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose

in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face immanent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  And will there be a third season?

in Mamaroneck, NY, their phone number is: (914) 381-5155.

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

I think Art's my favourite for the most part, but I'm not really

You are right, the Sonic comic from Archie seems to be very popular in
America, but mainly because its the only one available. Besides, a running
cartoon series is the best support a comic can ever get.

However, I assume that things look a little different in Europe. The
Sathurday morning series isn't available on TV or video yet, most people
here don't even know that it exists. The fans have to read the comic if
they want to find out more about their favourite hero (this might also be
the reason why the Fleetway comic is based on the games instead of the
cartoon.).

> I think it's a European product; can our German native

As far as I know, the Fleetway comic is originally made in England.
Translated adaptions are available in France, Italy and Germany.

I don't know how to get a subscription the official way. But if you want  
to order back issues, you can write to the following address:

        SONIC BACK ISSUE ZONE
        Aim Ltd.
        PO Box 10

To order by phone with a credit card you have to dial 01144-91-5102290

Have you seen the intro or ending part of the 'Sonic CD' game? Sonic looks
cool in it, but to my opinion a little bit too 'japanese'. It would be
better if _DIC_ would do the movie. They already did a great job on the
Sathurday morning series, why shouldn't they been able to make a good movie
as well? Or maybe a _co-production_ with a japanese company...

Um... by the way, why is everyone so sure that a movie is in the planning?
Shouldn't we first try to find out if it's really true? (Anyone happens
to know the e-mail address of Archie Comics?)

Take it easy

I thought so. The comic isn't listed in _any_ foreign mail order catologues
I know of (and that's quite a lot). I found out about it because I wrote to
all major comic publishers in Germany asking if they are planning to publish
a Sonic comic in the near future. One told me about the Fleetway comic and
the German adaption they are selling.

I also wrote to all important TV networks (about eight or so) asking for
the Sonic cartoon, but without any success <sigh>...

Of course there is. Try

        SONIC BACK ISSUE ZONE
        Aim Ltd.
        PO Box 10
        Sunderland, SR4 6SN
        United Kingdom

> Or does anyone

There is only little chance for this. I called all the shops for foreign
comics in Germany I know of (at least 30), but no one had this comic.  
Finally I asked someone to buy an issue in a store in England so I could  
find out the addresses (the ordering info is written in almost every  
issue).

I read the German adaption as well because some issues of the English
original are already 'sold out'.


Now how about talking a little more about the Sathurday morning cartoon?
I have only little information about it. Maybe someone could post a  
summarize about the episodes that is a little more detailled than the
one in the FAQ?

I'm also looking for a synopsis of the Sonic books by Teitelbaum/Adams. I  
ordered them as soon as I saw them listed in the FAQ, but it will take at  
least two months until I get them (if I get them at all).


Best wishes

Yeah, and this one isn't even animated!  Remember the Tom Hanks movie
"Turner & Hooch"?  During the movie, Hooch (who's breed I can't recall)
hitches with a collie, and as best as I could gather from what is shown
at the end of the movie, all the female puppies are collies and the one
male puppy was a miniature Hooch!

Yeah, yeah, yeah...I've seen my fair share of cartoons.(and your share and 
his share and ...)  I know all about toon X-breeding (father species = son's 
species, etc.) and "DAVID PISTONE'S GUIDE TO CROSS BREEDING ON 
ANTHROPOMORPHIC WORLDS" was a great explanation (not to be repeated here  ;).

So...to sum it all up, who was Sally's mother and what was her species? right?

I'll straighten all this out...a little chat with Ben Hurst (and a small

I'm not the type to nitpick typos, but since you spelled it this way 
twice, you may not know: it's spelled "Saturday".  (:3

(Can you find the spelling and/or grammar error I've introduced in this 
post as penance for the sin of pointing out another's error?)  (;3

Again, I would if I could.  Unfortunately, KOMO (the local ABC affiliate) 
has been yanking my chain about when/if they show Sonic (they tend to 
show that dreadful Cryptkeeper cartoon instead), so I've only seen a few 
episodes and have none on tape.  Someone offered to send someone else a 
copy of all the episodes when he had his collection complete, and I asked 
him to do the same for me; though I haven't heard back from him, maybe he 
could provide them for you?  (They'd be NTSC, of course, but I understand 
it's easier to find NTSC VCRs in Europe than PAL ones in America...)

Makes sense.  A whole bunch of new characters, not properly introduced, 
would throw those poor Euros for a loop (no offense intended, just being 
silly).  And as I have Sonics 1, 2, K, and CD, and plan to get 3 and 
Spinball as soon as funds allow, I guess I'm biased towards the game's 
presentation.

While I'm thinking of the games, anyone else share my gripe that the 
plots for Sonic and Knuckles in S3&K (in case I'm confusing anyone with 
this abbreviation, it's Sonic 3 and Sonick&Knuckles locked together) 
diverge so widely at the end?  I mean, Knuckles never sees either Sonic 
or the Death Egg... and poor Tails is stuck being the poor man's Sonic 
again (at least this time they let him fly and swim and stuff).  Ah 
well.  Maybe some day they'll do a Tails game for the Sega...

Personally, I don't think there's a thing wrong with that, but I suppose 
a movie for American audiences ought to look more American.  Perhaps, 
though, the Japanese should do a Sonic anime which I can have my local 
anime club import...  (;3

Actually, I'm so-so on the SatAM animation quality.  It's miles beyond 
the afternoon stuff (but then, Mario Bros. is on a par with *that*) and 
pretty high-quality for SatAM fare, but a movie should look a lot 
better.  Of course, movies have higher budgets... so I guess we'll wait 
and see.

> Or maybe a _co-production_ with a japanese company... 

That could be interesting.  But I thought DIC was partly Japanese...

Good point.  (:3  Anyone want to take up the challenge?

Hello everyone!

I've been pretty occupied in the past 2 weeks.  I had some computer
last week, so when I was able to reconnect to the Internet World, I 
got 106 messages.  Needless to say, that kept me busy for at least
a few minutes :)  And I'd like to say "thank you" to all that sent inform-
ation to me about the finer legalities of making a Sonic story.  This is
a somewhat more long-term project than I anticipated (trying to create
a world in the mind's eye of a person that already has some idea of
how it's pictured is difficult enough;  try creating a new world and set
of people, it starts to get rather tedious).  I'm a geology major, not a 
storyteller!  But I'm not giving up on this one.  I can't say when exactly
it will be available, but I can tell you that it will be finished before the
advent of summer school.  Ami Pro is getting the workout of its encoded
life (yes, I will save it as a text file).  Another thing is it looks as if 
it's going
to be a fairly sizable piece of work, extrapolated from what I have in the
file now.  A picture paints 1000 words, and I'm trying to take it from the
opposite end.  It's been a fun project so far, and I promise it will be com-
pleted.

I believe the person who offered this was David Pistone in response to
my "intro" post.  I e-mailed him to, but have yet to hear from him (aside
from his posts to the list).

C'mon, David, don't leave us in the dark!!  Please say that you'll do this.
Pretty please...etc. etc. etc. :-) fingers crossed.

Actually, IMO the divergent endings make sense.  Look at it this way:

Knuckles is someone who doesn't know a thing about the wars between Robotnik
and the animals.  He only cares about the protection of Floating Island and
its Chaos Emeralds.  As long as the island is safe and there are no
potential evil forces surrounding it, he's happy.  This was why
he is such a pain for Sonic during most of the game.  Robotnik was able
to convince him that Sonic was the one trying to steal the Emeralds.  Only
when Knuckles sees Robotnik himself heisting the Master Emerald does he
realize who the real bad guy is.

On the other hand, Sonic has spent the last two games (whatever time frame
that translates to) fighting Robotnik, and is ready to pursue him (quite
literally) to the ends of the Earth if necessary.  If Robotnik fleas into
space, Sonic will follow.

Of course, the two endings taken at face value still don't make sense when
put together.  For one thing, where does the Master Emerald finally end up:
in Metal-Sonic's hands or Robotnik's?  So here's how I view it:

When Knuckles finally realizes that Sonic is a good guy, he takes Sonic's
word that Sonic will retrieve the Master Emerald from Robotnik by any means
necessary.  Then, after Metal-Sonic fails to hold Sonic and Tails at bay,
Robotnik fleas with the Master Emerald to outer space, with Sonic and Tails in
hot pursuit.  Meanwhile, Metal-Sonic isn't quite dead, and, in his
damaged state, he sees as his final mission the destruction of Knuckles and
possession of all remaining Chaos Emeralds.  Guess who wins? :-)

Also, I think Tails was given more to do in this game.  You'll notice
that quite a few of the zones are different if you use Sonic alone than
if you use Sonic & Tails, especially the zone (forgot the name) where
Sonic is fighting Robotnik in the air, and Tails must fly and carry Sonic
during the battle.  Granted, he was little more than window dressing in
Sonic 2, but I do believe they did a better job of integrating him into
the game with Sonic 3.

Prob'ly in the way that many cartoon companies (including the
makers of "The Simpsons") often farm certain animation tasks to overseas
firms to cut costs...doesn't necessarily mean that the overseas boys have
anything to do with the story or artwork itself.

Very good point, since this came from the same mail-page that was giving
opinions about when the video game "Sonic 5" was going to come out.
"Sonic 5"?!??  I'm sorry, but if S+K is being considered as "Sonic 4",
then how come Sonic Spinball wasn't called "Sonic 3", thereby throwing
the entire numbering system out of whack!  And, of course, with the usual 
uncertainty about upcoming mini-series or when new characters will make
their first appearance...we definitely need to find another source about
this movie thing.  Keep your fingers crossed.

I guess my gripe is that this only applies when you're playing as Sonic.  
When you're playing as Knuckles, shouldn't you periodically get a chance 
to dump Sonic down the drain or something?  (:3

That's not the only thing that isn't kosher between the two stories; for 
instance, when I said Knuckles never sees the Death Egg I meant it 
literally.  It's been removed from the backgrounds of all the scenes 
where Sonic sees it (like Launch Base in S3 and Lava Reef in S&K).  I 
think you get my point, though.  I want continuity in my plots!  (:3

Marble Garden.  I just checked.  (:3  Actually, Sonic with Tails can get 
places Sonic alone can't get, but the levels aren't significantly 
different; the scene you mention, in fact, has Tails showing up long 
enough for Sonic to get the airlift he needs, then helifoxing off at the 
start of the Carnival Night Zone.

Cynical response: well, they'd have to.  (:3  Tails in Sonic 2 was a 
shorter Sonic who couldn't become Super.  Tails in Sonic 3 is actually a 
unique character with his own strengths and weaknesses.

> ...we definitely need to find another source about this movie thing. 
> Keep your fingers crossed. 

Done.  (:3

ObSonicStories: my second-biggest gripe about the cartoon (the first 
being Antoine the Useless) is Tails' relegation to sidekick status.  Just 
because he doesn't have star billing, he gets to deliver such 
dramatically challenging lines as "Sonic, look out!"  Oy.  Somebody write 
a story where he actually gets something important to do all by himself.  
Or maybe I will.  (:3

I just want to add my opinion to the friendly "row" over Sally's species.  I
think she must be at least 1/3 fox, because if she
were adopted (or her father for that matter) where is the divine right of
kings and queens, then?  Where is Sally's genetic link to the first Acorn
Monarchs?  I doubt, through the staunch belief in blood in royalty that a
stepchild could ever gain the throne.  Perhaps if the entire Acorn line was
dead save for Sally, but then there would be no more Acorns, and so she would
have begun a new line.  Tell me if I'm wrong, please!  Maybe marriage has
brought stepchildren into monarchies in the past, but the way I see it, Sally
is her father's daughter, as Acorn was his father's son.

Long Live Princess Sally!
To a free Mobius!

Has anybody entertainted the thought that Earth genetics might not be

necessarly have to be the same as old European Monarchy. Maybe cross-breeding
no no-problem on Mobius. A lot of Maybes and no answers, but I just had to

Of course you could be one of the people that thinks that Mobius might

The whole cross-breeding thing was given a pretty good spin by David
Pistone, plus keep in mind that the StH universe isn't the only cartoon
universe we've seen where offspring are definitely one species or another.
So, yes, I believe the general consensus is that Sally's mother is a
ground squirrel (or whatever species Sally herself is).

What we really need is a detailed story of Robotnik's initial coup, answering
questions about Sonic's parents, Sally's mother, etc.  Of course, you
couldn't really get away with slapstick in a story like this one, and

Well, there's a debate here as well.  Personally, I'm on the "Mobius
is another world entirely" side, and in fact I like to think of Mobius
being in a whole other universe, one where magic exists and, on
planets like Mobius, is often used hand-in-hand with technology.

<sigh>, yet another Saturday without Sonic.  Guess I'll go watch
"The Tick"...

To everyone who sent me requests asking for the Sonic episodes on tape.

first, I would like to acknoledge the fact that I did get the requests.  
I haven't asked for addresses or money or anytrhing because, as I 
mentioned before, my set will not be complete for two more weeks.  "Spy 
Hog" airs in my area next Saturday and "The Doomsday project" airs the 
Saturday after that.  Once I have those two episodes, THEN I'll send out 
individual replies asking for addresses and other information.

Until then, be patient

With all the different problems over the differences between Sonic comics, 
books,
and shows, something very disheartening caught my ear today...

In the 1st season episode "Sonic Boom", Sally finds a message from her father,
traces it's origin to Ironlocke Prison, and sets out on a quest to find it.  
Upon arrival, 
Sally asks Nichole for data on Ironlocke...

Response:
"built in 1543; abandoned 100 years ago..."

The 2nd season ep. "Blast to the past" set the current date at 3235, therefore,
(with some quick math) Ironlocke Prison was in use for 1,592 years!!!
This seems highly unrealistic, so I'm left with a feeling that there may be 
contradictions just between the 1st & 2nd season!!  

Where's the authority here!?!  Everything is screwed up !!!
(oh well)

Thanks, I really didn't know. If you like, you can send all further error

I won't see it as a flame. It's been a long time since I had English at

I accept every help I can get to improve my grammar.

I've already found someone who is willing to send me all episodes. But  
until I get them I'm highly interested to hear more details about the  
cartoon (anyone willing to write a detailled summarize?).

BTW, is there a synopsis of the Sonic books by Teitelbaum/Adams available?

Well, so what do you think about it? Nobody interested in IRC (Internet  
Relay Chat)? I know that AOL users can't use it, but how about the others?  
It could be fun.

I've tried IRC on Delphi, and it seems flaky at best -- most likely 
because it was (still is??) a telnet link to somewhere else.  USIT does 
offer IRC but I've never tried it.  My biggest problem will be trying to 
come up with a time when I know I can be present.

My problem with IRC has been friendliness, or lack thereof.  When I saw 
the message that started this thread, I headed off to IRC, only to find 
three Sonic groups: #sonic, #sonik, and #~SONiC~ if I recall.  (There was 
also a #sonicyouth group.)  The people in Sonic were saying things so 
bizarre that for all I know I'd stumbled upon a secret society meeting, 
and when they figured out I didn't 'belong' they wouldn't talk to me.  
The second group completely shut up when I entered it, so must have been 
something semi-private.

I think the mailing list is a better system anyway.  We have time to 
compose our messages, but the list runs quickly enough that a dialogue 
can take place.  If you want to virutally meet, though, there's always 
FurToonia (a MUCK); there's a small area there dedicated to Sonic, and 
one of the people on our list actually plays him there.  (:3

Sheesh, that sounds (not) fun.  Also, keep in mind that for us college-
types, many schools have banned the use of IRC on their systems, due to
the massive amounts of telnet time it requires.

I can't speak for anybody else, but I have yet to try any of these places.
A friend of mine once tried to get me to explore "The Foothills," but by then
the runners of the place required a snail-mail form to join, and I was
too lazy.  How 'bout posting some info for us interested, such as the
telnet address and anything else we need to know to join.

Assuming you mean information on specific episodes, rather than the cartoon
as a whole, I can do that.  (I sprung for the $1.50 for rental.  (:3)  Here
are a few episodes to get the ball rolling; hopefully, list-readers will
pipe up with more...

SONIC RACER
written by Len Janson

Sonic, Princess Sally, and Bunnie Rabbot are on a mission to disable one
of Robotnik's generator plants; Sonic distracts the Swatbots guarding the
plant, Sally shuts down the alarm systems, and Bunnie strongarms the
physical shields protecting the main computer controls.  After a little
button-pushing by Sally, the whole plant smokes quite nicely; Sonic
provides a warp-speed lift out of the area as Robotnik fumes. 

Sonic and Bunnie celebrate their success, but their celebration is
premature, as Sally points out; a backup generator kicks into operation. 
The Freedom Fighters return to Knothole to plan the assault on the backup
generator. Meanwhile, Snively suggests the old Robin Hood ploy to get
Sonic: a speed contest with a trophy to the winner. 

Sonic learns of the contest the next day and, predictably, expounds on how
easily he'll blow away the competition.  Sally points out that it's
probably just a trap, but Sonic notes that while Robotnik's chasing him,
the backup generator will be underdefended.  Snively and Robotnik,
meanwhile, are testing their secret weapon: a panther-like robot capable
of Sonic-level speeds.  That night, Bunnie reads a bedtime story to Tails;
Sally worries about Sonic's safety despite Tails and Bunnie's attempts to
reassure her. 

The next day (though it's always night in Robotropolis), the race is about
to get underway; as Robotnik waits for Sonic to show, Bunnie, Sally, and
Antoine sneak into the curiously deserted city.  Sonic makes his entrance
in a "Little Red Rodent Hood" disguise, expresses his disgust at the
caliber of his competition (a few hovers), and is in turn impressed as the
pantherbot makes its entrance at speed. 

The race begins, and Sonic and the bot are neck and neck (the hovers, as
expected, are no contest); the bot suddenly goes to full speed, and Sonic
loses his disguise as he hits his own 'afterburners'.  Robotnik releases
the first of a series of boobytraps on the course (laserbeams across the
track), but Sonic dodges them with a quick leap.  Nicole locates the
backup generator for Sally's group, but the question remains: how to get
past the guards that are still there? 

Sonic continues to deal with attempts on his life on the track while Sally
figures out how to get into the plant: climb up onto the roof and enter
through the skylight.  Unfortunately, while trying to get to the controls
of the plant, Antoine clutzes up, starting some machinery in action which
draws him along a conveyor towards crushing gears.  Bunnie is unable to
stop the works, so Sally sets off a flare, drawing Sonic off the race to
rescue the group.  Sonic jams the works with a Power Ring, which starts a
power reaction ultimately leading to the vaporization of the backup
generator; Sonic and the gang, of course, are long gone. 

Around the campfire back at Knothole, Sally and Sonic toast the lastest
victory for the Freedom Fighters. 

SONIC BOOM
written by Len Janson

Sonic, Antoine, and Cat (a one-shot character) break into one of
Robotnik's facilities, where they meet with Sally (who snuck in disguised
as one of the security robots).  Antoine and Cat stand guard as Sonic and
Sally work on disabling the Stealthbots awaiting launch there.  Sonic gets
increasingly edgy as security gets too close for comfort, but Sally's
received a puzzling message from the computer she's hacking: "Bean", an
endearment her father used.  As she tracks the transmission to the Dark
Swamp, Antoine klutzes up again and is discovered by the patrol bots,
forcing a rapid withdrawl; Sonic runs interference while Sally bails out. 
Cat is separated from the group during the escape and is captured. 

Sonic finds out about Cat's capture and heads back to find him; Sally
takes Antoine to the Swamp to track down the message.  Robotnik attempts
to interrogate Cat, but gets no information; he sends the feline to a
holding cell, where he is found by Sonic.  Sonic finds out from Cat that
Robotnik knows where Sally's going and is forced to abandon his rescue
attempt by concentrated weapons fire; he heads off to the swamp to save
Sally. 

Sally and Antoine, meanwhile, have discovered that the only structure in
the swamp is Ironlock Prison, which has been abandoned for 100 years. They
decide to check it out while Sonic and a Stealthbot both persue; Sonic
spots and destroys the Stealthbot as Sally and Antoine enter the prison. 
Sally finds a section of her father's royal cloak, then an ancient
computer, and Sonic finds them.  The computer contains a partial message,
proving Sally's father is alive (or at least was until recently), and a
map of tunnel complexes providing access to the entirety of Robotropolis. 
Unfortunately, the computer is also boobytrapped, and Sonic accidentally
sets off the trap, dumping them all into an underground passage. 

A giant monster approaches, but Sonic powers through it with a Power Ring,
revealing it to be a robotic creation.  Sally uses the maps to lead the
group back to the Stealthbot hangar, where they finish the mission they
set out to perform.  Their task complete, Sonic sets off to rescue Cat,
but the cell is empty.  The group makes their escape and watches the light
show as the Stealthbots, sent to pursue them, self-destruct.

Well, the U.K. Sonic comic has solo stories with Tails as the hero, but  
mostly done by someone with inferior drawing talents (compared to the  
usual quality of the artwork).

I've also heared strange things about American banks, like they will not  
exchange currency as a normal course of business and they charge about
35 % of the value as a processing fee. Please note that you have to pay  
them in _their_ currency if you want to order.

A few Arabic `Universities' have that sort of regular usage.

Hmm, I must put in something more so I don't get a reputation for
one-liners...  Australia's having a comics+entertainment expo/
convention in about a week's time-- I can't say how much of a
presence Sega/Archie/et al. have planned, but I have other reasons
for attenting (bludge off your friends time!).  I suppose I'm
obliged to write up a Con report, eh?  :)

I saw this in alt.fan.furry and alt.config and tend to agree with it as
getting over 400 messages in 3 days is a little excessive for a mailing-list.
If you want this list to be created post your replies to the newsgroup
alt.config (replying here won't accomplish anything).

>From quozl@netcom.com:

Back in December, I made a suggestion in alt.fan.furry about having an 
"alt.tv.sonic" newsgroup created. Someone else took the suggestion and 
proposed it to alt.config, where I responded, cleaning up the proposal to 
something more presentable there. During the course of the discussion, it 
had been decided that the name of the proposed newsgroup needed to be 
changed, so it wouldn't limit itself to just the TV version of Sonic, 
which may have a short life as such. The final name chosen was 
"alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog". In general, it had a favourable reception.
However, certain incidents at the time that I could've re-proposed under 
the new, more favourable, name that would've resulted in an 
illegitimately-created newsgroup (read: "bogus"), thus the 
generally-accepted proposal died and the newsgroup was never created.

Until now.

In the meantime, a mailing list had been created, which has, 
unfortunately, proved to be way too popular, and is too high traffic for 
a significant number of potential readers (such as myself, Ron Bauerle, & 
others) to handle.

I am RE-proposing the newsgroup "alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog", which will 
cover as many aspects of Sonic the Hedgehog as possible, from the 
videogames, to the two TV cartoon series, to comic books, to 
merchandising, etc. This will either suppliment or replace the existing 
mailing list, depending on how the readers of the mailing list choose to 
handle the matter.

I would appreciate it if this is passed to the mailing list. Thanks.

Discussions are directed to alt.config.

....Quozl!

I believe he is talking about this list, and not that he is managing this

But there have only been about 250 messages ever posted to this mailing list.
I don't see what he meant by hundreds of messages per day.

FurToonia's Telnet address is 198.102.68.2 8888; the last number is
important, as it's a port number (saves you having to answer the usual
intimidating login prompt).  You can call and connect to 'guest' (the
program gives you instructions once you connect); to get a character of
your own, you have to send email to ftadmin@rtd.com, including the
character name and password that you want in the message. 

If you need any more information, email me personally!  (:3

And he doesn't even get to do *that* much in the cartoons.  Sure, he's

Hey, Paul!

This is what I was looking for some time ago.  There's a.f.animaniacs, so why
not a.f.s-h?  You have my vote as a supporter for the newsgroup.  We could 
probably use more support for the teen blue hedgehog (in a more public than
this newsgroup may provide).

_WOW_!! Dan Drazen should put this in his FAQ! Although I haven't seen

Can anyone else provide me with information?

That would be 133 messages a day.  That would overwhelm me, too, which 
would be mondo uncool.  Some mailing lists really do have that level of 
activity, but I've counted about 260 messages since opening day on 4 Feb 95.

If you have other list subscriptions, I could understand your receipt of 
133 messages a day.

What do you expect from a list that's way past cool? :-)  I sent mail to 
quozl to tell him the list was about to open.  I wondered why he hadn't 
subscribed, but decided not to press the issue.  Of course, we do need 
all the (Earth-bound) Freedom Fighters we can get so that someday we can 
go to Mobius and help rid them of the scourge of Robuttnik.

This list is not for the games, so the proposed group would be 
different.  But would it offer something that the Sega newsgroups cannot?
I'd be willing to post my merchandise list there (if possible), and maybe 
someone can improve on it.

Does everyone here have access to alt.* groups?  Or does anyone's site 
carry only "selected" alt.* groups?

USIT carries nearly all alt.* groups, but I've not been able to post to 
any newsgroup (except usit.*) for three weeks.  I used to be a frequent 
poster to alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons, but no longer for that reason.  
If Delphi had a.b.s.c, I could post from there.  So unless Delphi picks 
up the a.f.s-h group (if created), I won't be able to post anything.  
(Actually, I do have my Nyx account, but that's too slow for me to use 
more than about once every 2-3 weeks.)

Probably this list.  I sent quozl private mail just before opening day.  
I don't know of any other Sonic list.

You got it.  Watch this space for: BLOODLINES, a serialized piece of

more, will be dealt with over the course of the story.

I think it's a great idea. As long as there is some kind of fan club for sonic,
I'm happy.

Sadly, no.  Georgia Tech does not carry any alt. groups, although I do
have access, using the laUNChpad network at North Carolina.  You can imagine
how slow that can be, tho'.

I can't post from UNC, but I do have some e-mail addresses that will direct
posts to any newsgroup you want, including alt. groups.  I was wondering,
couldn't there also be places that will bundle up and mail you the posts
of a certain group.  'Course, I can imagine that would make your mailbox
pretty stuffed.  The net.gods might not like that.
 
Don't get me wrong, I think an alt. group is a great idea.  I just hope
the creators of it keep in mind that not everybody is going to be able
to read it conveniently, if at all.

Le'see here...In Sonic 2, he's just been introduced--both to us, and to
the battle between Sonic and Robotnik.  So naturally, while he's just starting
to take it all in, he isn't going to do much on his own.

In Sonic 3, he's starting to get the hang of it and is doing more exploring
on his own (hence, the slight differences in the zones if you play Tails
alone compared to S+T or Sonic alone), but he still knows that Sonic
is better suited and more experienced to fight Robotnik.

And so...in Sonic 4 (and it ain't S+K, Archie!!), we shall see Tails taking
the initiative and having his own set of goals to accomplish apart from
Sonic...almost like what we saw in the different endings between Sonic
and Knuckles only a little more stable in the continuity department.  Of
course, with my lousy luck, Sonic 4 will be a 32X game, and I'll have to
buy another system!

Okay, dropping that hot potato before people accuse me of not staying on
relevant subjects...

Typical of my ever random and daydreaming thought patterns, I've been
doing a little thinking on who should do the music to the Sonic movie (hoping
there is one).  How about Jan Hammer? 

Now before you start thinking "Miami Vice?!!", I suggest you listen to
one of his CDs entitled _Escape from Television_.  It contains the "Vice"
theme and some other music used from that series, but with a lot of his
music, Hammer sets up a dramatic and dark atmosphere that I think would
perfectly match the state of Mobius at the time of Robotnik's tyranni.

The odds of it happening are probably less than those of Sally marrying
Antoine, but it's still cool to think about.

later---Kris

Anything uploaded to ftp.mv.com in the /pub/users/rat/incoming directory will
be reviewed, and if it's any good, I'll make it public.

I have reviewed that, and I just put it in sonic/images/perv/

In case any of you are wondering what we're talking about, I have an ftp
directory for sonic stuff. It's ftp.mv.com in the /pub/users/rat/sonic/
directory.

I, for one, can.  As I said, I can participate in a Sonic alt.* group 
over my Nyx account, but that's too slow for me to use more than once 
every 2-3 weeks.  It takes 6 minutes(!) just for nn to start up.

If you think a Nyx account is worthwhile for yourself, just telnet to 
nyx.cs.du.edu and login as new.  Complete the verification procedure and, 
if desired, request access to binaries groups.

USIT probably would pick up a.f.s-h, but will they ever fix whatever 
keeps me from posting to non-local groups....?  I've not been able to 
post to newsgroups from USIT for three weeks.

I said in alt.config (from Delphi, of course) that I would find out if 
anyone on the list would have trouble accessing this group, if created.  
I'll wait a bit longer for results and post them.

I hope so too.  Even if I could be certain of no problems myself, I know 
that several people on the list have limited 'net access.  One of my 
brothers (not subscribed) only gets mail and read/post privileges for 
about 30 or so newsgroups.

The proposal said the group would supplement or replace the mailing 
list.  Which it turns out to be is up to us.

If this group is created, would anyone be willing to capture the messages 
for the list users?  I assume most list users will be able to access the 
group, so I'd suggest making the captures available on a short- or 
long-term basis at the ftp site and/or majordomo.  I know that the 
now-defunct utpapa site at utexas.edu once stored archives of 
alt.tv.tiny-toon so maybe we can do something similar.

I have added some new files to the ftp site (ftp.mv.com

mailing list software soon. 

To get a list of retrievable files, send mail to majordomo@sard.mv.net.  
The subject line will be ignored, but you can use it for your reference.  
Send these two lines in your message:  
  index sonic
  end
Once you have the name of the file(s) you want, send another message, but 
instead of the index command, use:
  get sonic filename.txt
You can use multiple get commands to request multiple files, but the end 
command should be the last line in your message text.

Here are the new files:
  fleetway-summary
     Summary of some of the Fleetway comics (captured from the list)
  episode-summary
     Summary of the Saturday morning cartoon episodes (captured from the
     list)
  tails-raa

HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa!!!!

I like your style!  (sick & twisted though it may be...)
I wuz wondering why after being reviewed that it was stuck in "images/perv" 
- of course I guess it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see why  ;)
Comments: MORE!

  

Well, that's my two cents (and you get what you pay for) ;)

I made the perv directory, as a warning sign. I don't have anything against

could make a directory if people like that sort of thing.

Good idea.

That's up to you.(obviously)  I think there are already enough furry sites out
there, but another couldn't hurt.  You may just want to keep with the theme-
allow "perv" files, but keep them with only Sonic characters...otherwise, furry
fans will flood your incoming dir. which may cause problems in the long run.
(talking from experience)

The one pic that's there now is great!(IMO)  I have a few on my system
that I will upload, but I'll wait for a final decision on what type of files
you will allow before I do...

Who has the "largest collection of Sonic art" ? I vaguely remember someone 
bragging about this, but I can't remeber now who or where - could someone
re-post the address (WWW or FTP)?
Gotta juice...

Well, that's my two cents (and you get what you pay for) ;)

/* Here are the beginnings of a Sonic merchandise list.  Let's try
   to make it more complete and in time make it a retrievable file.
   Although the Sonic list isn't for games, I think it would make
   sense to include them here.  

   All information on Sega products was cut and pasted from a session
   log on CompuServe.  Submissions of brief game descriptions are
   welcome.

   Are Sonic cels available?  Not that I could ever afford one, but I
   will include them if given the info.

   I would like to keep this document seperate from the FAQ, but I do need
   your help with submissions, descriptions, and corrections.

   Can anyone else supply details?
2. Sonic the Hedgehog LCD Wrist Game from Tiger Electronics.  This
   was offered in conjunction with some of the video cassettes.  You

   The offer has already expired.  Is this game also sold in stores?
3. AMAZING SONIC THE HEDGEHOG POCKET ARCADE from Sega
   Sonic and Robotnik are at it again!  The diaboloicol Dr. Robotnik has created a
   robot factory and it's up to Sonic to stop the mass production of metal mutants!
   Sonic works his way through the maze-like rooms in an effort to find and remove
   the Emeralds - the factory's only power source. Team up with Sonic through 12
   levels of fast and furious action as he tries to put Robotnik out of business -
   for good!
4. GAME GEAR SONIC 2 SYSTEM from Sega
5. GENESIS SONIC 2 SYSTEM from Sega
6. SONIC CD from Sega
   In his first CD adventure, Sonic goes head to head with The Metal Sonic,

   Sonic discovers Robotnik wants all of the Time Stones from The Little Planet so
   he can bend time and rule the world!  Can you help Sonic get them first?
7. SONIC CHAOS FOR GAME GEAR from Sega
   Here he comes, straight from his high-speed Sonic 2 adventure!  Headstrong Sonic
   The Hedgehog and his feisty friend Tails blast into hyperspeed to save the Chaos
   Emeralds. If evil Dr. Robotnik snatches the Emeralds first, he'll make a Super
   Bomb!  Could this be the end?

HELLO Everybody!  Just thought I'd hop in and introduce myself....  I'm a

name is Bryant Melesko and I am a student here at California State
University at Northridge.  I am a computer science major, with a strong
interest in computer art and artwork alike.  

To the point...... 

	I have about 40 megs of Sonic Artwork in my archives which is
considered the largest collection anywhere(currently as of 04/02/94) seen.
 If anyone has a larger archieve than I, I'm willing to share my images. 
There's a lot of potential here in this mailing list, so keep it alive! :^)
I think you all are WAY PAST COOL!

Since my name's been dropped here :^), I guess I should respond...

I am in favor of the creation of the group.  While I _can_ keep up with
_reading_ the traffic on the list, I can't keep up with _posting_ to it;
for some reason I feel this would be different for a newsgroup
(probably because if I don't reply to a post, eventually it gets
deleted, whereas e-mail is forever, until I run out of disk space
:^)).  The last is another reason why I favor a group over a list: I
read Usenet on a different system which doesn't enforce (yet!) disk
quotas, thus I can save as much of Usenet as I want.  E-mail I have to
archive to my home PC every so often just to free up space on my work
account.

Also, the list has the usual problems of off-topic posts and stuff I
don't want to read: e.g., game stuff (which is supposed to be
off-topic), and now a thread about "perverted" images...  This would
still be on-topic to alt.fan.s-h, but make it easier for me to skip it.

Guess that's all I have for now - so what _does_ it take for an alt
group to be created?  (Maybe I should read the FAQ that's always
showing up...)

I would like to see a newsgroup for the discussion of sonic and his related
friends.  I think its a lot easier for me and many others to have it as a
newsgroup than as a mailing list.  Not that its bad, its cool, but it does
clutter up my mailbox quickly.

Oh yeah, one more thing. All who are in support of alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog
should post something to that effect on alt.config. There's a thread
there already, so if you just crank back your newsreader a few days, you
should be able to find it. New newsgroups don't just happen, they need
your support.

One question: since this is a screencapture from the actual show-- what 
are they *supposed* to be doing in this scene?  (:3

We're just in the initial brain-dump phase of a mailing list,, In a
few weeks we'll certainly be in the small list category... :)

I think a newsgroup would be a bad idea-- with even long-established
alt groups (ie: alt.tv.simpsons!) falling out of the feed here in
Australia and elsewhere because of the problems the hierarchy is for
news admins, how do you expect a new group to propagate outside a
minority of systems like Netcom?  Mailing lists are readily available
everywhere and have near-instant propagation.  And what if alt.*
effectively disappears as a consequence of S.314??

In that particular scene, they are trying to hold down that panel so that 
the Swat-bots can't come through.

Actually, I examined the episode and located the original scene and they 
weren't in that position.  Victor's pic is a composite image.  I located 
the scene where Sally is holding down that panel, but SONIC IS STANDING 
ON THE OTHER SIDE.  I'm still in the proccess of determining exactly 
where he got the shot of Sonic from.  Wherever he got it, he pasted it 
there.

Actually, the pic, salnsonc.gif suggests that he rather enjoys himself

Greetings!

rotor@primenet.com here.  I'm posting from this other address becaus
Primenet is down for the afternoon

Anyway, you want the details of theJPEG file????

Well, here it is . . .







(Just go down until you see it . . .)













Alright, for those of you who made it down here.

Here we have a shot for the episode, "Blast to the Past Part 2"  Princess
Sally is on her hands and knees, holding down a hatch so that the Swat-bot
beneath can't come through.  Thats what it was supposed to be in the
episode.  In the picture, the artist has pasted a picture of Sonic on his
hands and knees on top of her.  This combined with the expression on
Sally's face make for a VERY sexually suggestive scene.  I must admit that
it was very well done because I had to go back and watch the episode again
before I realized it was a composite image.

See ya'

I smell a net.conspiracy here.  Somebody want to enlighten me?
What is S.314, some government bill to restrict the 'Net?

I'll take private e-mail since this is obviously off topic.

Hi all.  I'm brand new to this mailing list, and, well, I work for Sega.  :) 
 I'm an Associate Producer in the STI group (the group that did Sonic 2, 
Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3, and Sonic & Knuckles), and I'm curious as to what 
Sonic fans and gamers would like to see and/or expect from another Sonic 
game.  We're planning on having one out for the 32X, so I'd like to hear 
from all you Sonic fans.

This is all unsolicited information for Sega... In other words, Sega didn't 
put me up to asking this; I'm asking for myself only.
^^^^^^^^^^^^The above is my disclaimer.  :-)

Thanks,
 -Mike

                                 Chapter 1


     There was a thick fog that morning, and that was good news
as far as Bunnie was concerned.  While it made it harder for her
to spot any incoming SWAT-bots, it made it harder for them to
spot her as well.
     She reached the base of the tree where a lookout post had
been set up: little more than a platform that ringed the trunk of
the tree about 30 feet up off the ground.  Using a rope ladder,
she climbed to the top and began her several hours of sentry
duty.
     If the day had been clear, she could have seen, about a
hundred feet from where she was, the spot where the forest met
the Great Plain.  Far down along the southern horizon could be
seen a hazy spot.  This had once been Mobotropolis, the capitol
city of the planet Mobius.  Now it was called Robotropolis, a
dark testament to the evil genius of the planet's overlord, Dr.
Ivo Robotnik.
     Bunnie couldn't clearly remember the details of that day a
decade ago when the once-beautiful world had fallen into
Robotnik's hands.  She herself had only been a child at the time,
and the episode had the haziness of a half-remembered bad dream. 
That was why she enjoyed the fog: it was easy to pretend, if only
for a moment, that nothing had ever gone wrong.  That
Mobotropolis was not now a choking, blighted factory instead of a
garden city, or that most of its inhabitants hadn't been
roboticized, turned into living machines that live only to serve
at Robotnik's twisted pleasure.  To imagine that she could simply
toss aside her role as a member of the Knothole freedom fighters
and live a real life once more.
     But there was no forgetting for Bunnie.  She was reminded of
her life every time she looked at her left arm, or at either of
her legs.  For she had been partially roboticized herself.  Her
limbs were clad with metal and shot through with transistors and
relays and other hardware.  It had earned her the name "Bunnie
Rabbot," and although the other freedom fighters meant well when
they gave her the name, there were time she sincerely hated that
name.  Wondering when she'd ever be whole again, she reached into
her pack, took out a range finder, began scanning the horizon...
     ...and found herself looking at a SWAT-bot not three feet in
front of her.  Gasping, she lowered the range-finder, and could
barely make out in the fog one of Robotnik's hover units level
with the platform, silently hanging in the air.
     "HALT, FREEDOM FIGHTER!"  the bot ordered in its mechanical
monotone.  "YOU ARE UNDER..."
     The SWAT-bot never got a chance to finish the sentence, as
its head suddenly flew away from its body.  Someone or something
was standing behind it, holding a large tree branch in its right
hand.  The fog was still too dense for Bunnie to make it out
clearly, but in a moment, another SWAT-bot could be seen leaving
the hover unit and approaching the shadowy figure from behind.
     Sensing the SWAT-bot's presence, the figure spun around and
delivered a solid punch to the SWAT-bot's midsection.  Bunnie
could see the bot crumble to the platform.
     The platform!  Bunnie could sense other SWAT-bots leaving
the hover unit and stepping onto the platform, and it was more
weight than the platform was meant to hold.  The figure grabbed
Bunnie by the hand as the platform gave way beneath her.  A
second later, the two of them were dangling from a rope that had
apparently been tied to a branch higher up the tree.  But the
sudden stop caused the strange figure to lose its grip on Bunnie,
and she resumed falling.
     Bunnie made a grab for the rope ladder and missed.  There
was one chance now: sensing that a tree branch was just below
her, she tried righting herself so that her robotic legs would
bear the brunt of the impact.  They did, but they also snapped
the branch in two.  Her descent was slowed, but she continued to
fall to the ground with such force that she lost consciousness on
impact.

     "Are you all right?"
     As Bunnie slowly came to, the first thing she was aware of
was the voice.  It managed to cut through the pounding of her
head.  She was glad to recognize the voice as that of her friend
and fellow freedom fighter, Sally.
     "Yeah, Ah'm OK, Sal.  Or Ah will be as soon as they stop
playin' them drums."
     Her head was beginning to clear as she felt someone helping
her to her feet.  She opened her eyes.
     At first she thought that her landing was still affecting
her senses.  The figure before her didn't look like Sally at all.
It wore a long, tattered cape the color of a dead leaf. 
Clustered near the shoulders on either side were small metallic
buttons, badges and insignia of some sort; they appeared to have
been sprinkled on in random fashion.  The figure also wore a head
scarf of the same color, with a veil covering the rest of the
face and permitting room only for the eyes.
     "Sally, girl, what the hoo-ha you doin' in that get-up?"
     Then Bunnie looked at the right hand of the figure, the hand
that had helped her to her feet.  It gleamed with the same
sickening metallic gleam as her own left hand and arm and her two
legs.  It was a robot hand.
     "Oh mah stars, you're not...Mmmmmph!"
     Instantly the figure clamped her hand against Bunnie's mouth
to silence her, pinning her back to a tree at the same time. 
Bunnie could sense that her feet were no longer touching the
ground; whoever this creature was, she was incredibly strong. 
She could see the eyes of the stranger narrowing.
     "You called me 'Sally' just now, didn't you?"
     Bunnie nodded.  What was going on here?  The stranger's
voice sounded just like Sally's!
     "The next time you see this 'Sally' I want you to give her
this."  With her free hand, she reached up and pulled one of the
metal pins from her cloak.  "If this means anything to her, have
her meet me tomorrow night at the foot of Dragonsnest at
moonrise.  Alone."
     The cloaked figure dropped the pin to the ground, then took
her hand away from Bunnie's mouth.  In the second it took Bunnie
to look for the pin, pick it up and look up, the mysterious
figure had melted into the forest.
     Bunnie picked herself up off the forest floor.  The fog was
beginning to lift enough for her to survey the damage.  The
remnants of the platform, and of five SWAT-bots lay around her,
and there was no telling how many there might still be on what
was left of the lookout platform above her.  The heads were
missing from two of them, robot arms had been detatched from
their bodies and lay scattered on the ground.  The hover unit was
nowhere to be seen.  Bunnie walked over to one fallen bot and
studied the hole in its chest.  She clenched her own robotic hand
into a fist and inserted it into the hole; it was almost a
perfect fit.
     This was crazy, Bunnie thought.  She may have learned some
martial arts techniques but she'd never thought to try taking on
a SWAT-bot in hand-to-hand combat.  Whoever had done this was
either incredibly brave or incredibly foolish.
     It was then that Bunnie remembered the strange figure, the
one who sounded so much like Sally but obviously wasn't.  But
then again...she looked at the pin the stranger had left with
her.  It looked like some sort of a brooch, and there was
something familiar about the design...
     "Yo, Bunnie!"
     "Over here, Sonic!"
     Before it occurred to Bunnie that things had gotten
interesting the last time she thought she recognized a voice,
Sonic the Hedgehog ran up to her.  "You OK, Bunnie?" he asked.
     "Ah guess so.  Had me a little trouble with some SWAT-bots,
but...."
     "Whoa, check it out!" he said as he picked up a SWAT-bot's
severed head.  "Man, you've been kickin' some serious bot butt!"
     "Thanks, Sugarhog, but it wasn't me."
     "Huh?"
     "Tell you later.  Right now we gotta get back to Knothole."

                              To be continued

Hey... that's great!  Finally a rep from Sega!  Well, being a 32X owner I 
expect great things from it.  From what I have seen from Chaotix... it 
looks pretty impressive... one question... Where is Sonic?!?!?  As I 
understand it... Sonic will make his appearance on the Japanese version 
of the game and not the American.  Is Sega of America focusing on 
Knuckles instead of our favorite blue speed demon?  I think that the 
characters should use the rings for more that just.. well.. points and 
keeping from getting you killed!  How about the rings as weapons, tossed 
projectiles?  I really liked the idea for Super Sonic using the rings as 
time for being Super.

Just as a side note... isn't Chaotix the next 32X "Sonic" type game or 
are you talking about another version?  If it's another version... try a 
32X-CD Sonic game... now that would rock!  How about that Sonic arcade 
game that never really made it?  Are they only going to bring out Sonic 
Arcade for the Saturn or will be playing it on out 32X?

Hmmm... maybe I have more questions than suggestions.  Oh well *:(.  BTW,

my way, it would be greatly appreciated!

Hi all,

Does anyone out there in Sonicland know what type of font they use for 
the Sonic logo.  I've been going mad searching for just the right font.  
If anyone knows the name of the font(s) (True type for windows wanted), 
it would be greatly appreciated.

   I saw that exact same font in an issue of Nintendo Power (something about
Final Fantasy III).  I wrote Nintendo and asked them what it was.  They
wouldn't tell me!  Then I noticed that Wizards of the Coast uses it for
Magic: The Gathering.  I haven't gotten around to asking them yet but I think
they have their own newsgroup.  Watch for another post.

OK. Here's what I want out of a Sonic game. First, let me give you a 
little background. My addiction to the Blue one started with the ABC 
cartoon when it premiered last year. I absolutely fell in love with the 
storyline and it's what prompted me into buying a Sega. I own Sonic 2, 
Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3, and have rented Sonic and Knuckles (hope to buy 
sooner or later). I have also become a fan of the Archie comic.
Well anyway, here's what I have liked about the Sonic games that I have 
played:

I like the ease of play of all the Sonics. By just using one button, the 
game can move a a faster pace without being difficult.

I like the multiple routes through the levels and the hidden areas. In 
particular, the Chemical Plant and Oil Ocean zones of Sonic 2 and the 
Marble Garden and Carnival Night zones of Sonic 3.

I like the continual increase in quality of the Sonic games. There is a 
noticeable improvement in the physics of the game. (In Sonic 2, Sonic 
would jump straight up, even on a slanted surface, while in Sonic 3 and 
later, he would jump perpendicular to the surface) Also the improvement 
in graphics has been well appreciated. (I didn't think that anything 
could be better than Sonic 3, but Sonic and Knuckles BLEW ME AWAY.)

The various shields that were added to the game increased options for 
game play and stratagy building.

Sonic Spinball was a definite change of pace. I am a bit of a pinball 
fanatic, so I really enjoyed it. I also loved the fact that you did 
include the characters from the Archie comics, at least in the bonus 
levels and the game story (I would have loved it more had it been based 
on the Saturday morning cartoon, but more on that later.)

The save game feature is a major plus. pleas include it in future games.

And, I love trying to find the debug codes (I know programers don't like 
to hear that gamers go mucking about in the debug mode, but hey, it's fun)
I think that the debug code for Sonic 3 was entirely too hard. (Up, Up, 
Down, Down, Up, Up, Up, Up, in a one second window of time? geez, what 
did you do, use a programable controler?) I was most satisfied when I 
finally finished the hidden special stage on Sonic 3 (the blue one that 
spirals inwards). 

I did not like the electric special stage of Sonic and Knuckles. I just 
couldn't get the knack for it.


Now for things that I would really want in the next Sonic game:

Fully incorporate the characters from the Saturday Morning cartoon. 
Possibly have Princess Sally as a playable character. (Make sure that 
it's the Princess Sally who's coloring matches the Saturday Morning 
cartoon and the most recent issues of the Archie comic, and not Amy Rose 
renamed from Sonic CD)

Make the game less linear. Give us some freedom to chose different paths, 
with different levels to play. You've allready taken some steps in that 
direction with the three different characters that you can play with 
Sonic 3 locked on to Sonic and Knuckles (Major kudos for that advancement 
BTW). Depending on if you played Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles, you took 
different routes through the levels. Just give us the ability to take 
different levels entirely.

Finally, the sugestion that I hear most, from fans and non-fans alike......

GIVE TAILS HIS OWN GAME!!!!!!!!
PLEASE!


I'd like to thank the mailing list for indulging me in posting this for 
everyone... I did it that way so you could respond to my points about the 
games. I know not all of you play them that much, and that we never 
intended for this to be a list about the games, but the games are what's 
driving the fiction, so we should do our best to make sure that the games 
are the best that they can be.

Well, Sega didn't send me---I'm here on my own, but I'll help where ever I

You know that here at Sega of America (SOA) we are committed to supporting 
the 32X, so you can expect a lot of software support for it.  Chaotix is 
just one example.  To answer your question, Sonic won't be appearing in 
Chaotix, because that's Knuckles' game.  (I don't know the real reason, so 
I'll just throw out that excuse.  Actually, see below)  :)

I haven't heard that one before.  I believe both versions are going to be 
the same, but ya never know---Sega of Japan sometimes goes off and does 
their own thing.  We do have an original 32X version of Sonic in the works, 
so SOA hasn't forgotten about our blue-friend.
Although, according to recent SOA marketing studies, Knuckles is a very 
popular guy... So popular that the execs felt he deserved his own game.

Chaotix is a 32X "Sonic-type" of game, but it isn't the game I was referring 
to.
As for the 32X-CD Sonic game---talk about a niche within a niche.  :)

The Sonic arcade game was apparently released in Japan, but never made it 
out to the States---I don't know why.  I know there is a Sonic game in the 
works for the Saturn, but it's being done over at Sega of Japan, so I have 
very little information on it.

Since you work for EB, you probably have a good idea of what consumers would 
like.  There's been a lot of asking for a Tails-only game:  How do you think 
consumers would react to that type of game, assuming it was a game in 
similar fashion to the "Sonic-series" of games, only better utilizing the 
abilities of our flying fox?

Yeep.  Quite a lot of stuff already posted on this thread.  Let's see if 
I can't pick out a topic or seven for reply...  (:3

Cool!  (:3  Always nice to have a Sega presence in the group.  
Personally, I think Sega should have an official presence in r.v.g.sega, 
but that's another topic...

MW> I'm an Associate Producer in the STI group (the group that did Sonic

Now this is strange.  I rented Spinball just the other day, and I could 
have sworn a different team had done it.  (For one thing, no offense, but 
the graphics weren't up to the usual 'par' for Sonic games.)  Still, you 
guys do good work; I've got Sonics 1, 2, and K, and will get 3 when I can 
afford it.

MW> and I'm curious as to what Sonic fans and gamers would like to see
MW> and/or expect from another Sonic game.  We're planning on having one
MW> out for the 32X, so I'd like to hear from all you Sonic fans. 

Well, let me first reiterate what several others have said: I want a 
"Tails" game.  And I'm 21, so I don't want some Pico thing or some 
walk-through game; I want something as challenging as the typical Sonic 
game featuring the Happy Fun Fox.  Failing that, keep Tails in future 
Sonic games and keep giving him stuff to do that Sonic can't match.  
Tails in Sonic 2 was a poor man's Sonic; in Sonic 3, he started to come 
into his own, but it wasn't really until S3&K, with Super Tails, that he 
became about even with the spiky blue speed demon.  I look to see him in 
Sonic 4 (or would that be Sonic 32X?) with new paths to take, new worlds 
to explore, and maybe even an entire Zone just for him (while Sonic's 
taking on Robotnik's latest plot on the ground, Tails takes to the air or 
water as a shortcut to the fiend's base...)  And give Super Tails some 
cool frizzy do-not-taunt-Happy-Fun-Fox graphics instead of just flashing 
his palette.

Got the idea yet that I'm a fan of Miles Prower?  (:3

Marc Young wrote:

MY> How about the rings as weapons, tossed projectiles?

I don't like this idea for any of the existing characters (Sonic, Tails, 
and Knuckles) but it'd be a neat thing to add if a new playable character 
is added to the next game.  While I'm thinking of it: in Sonic 4, allow 
people to mix-and-match their team of two characters (i.e., allow Tails 
to play lead with Sonic backup, or even Knuckles and Tails).  Sonic, when 
CPU controlled, can make his entrance in a blast of speed; Knuckles can 
just pop out of the ground.  (:3

MY> I really liked the idea for Super Sonic using the rings as time for

Random thought #17: allow the player to 'turn off' Super to conserve 
rings in parts they're confident of their chances in.  (Perhaps the 
mechanism of becoming Super should be pushing a button whilst paused, or 
something akin; do the same to reverse it...)

MY> try a 32X-CD Sonic game... now that would rock! 

As was later mentioned, this would be a fairly restricted market, but 
that doesnt' mean I wouldn't want to see it.  It might be the incentive I 
need to get a 32X.  (:3  Maybe a FMV Sonic (but *please* none of that 
'make correct choice and see more video, make wrong choice and don't' 
crap we've been getting lately.  Have branching plots and stuff; 
animation will compress a lot better than film, so you'll have room for 
that sort of thing...)  Or maybe a Sonic RPG (Popful Mail's doing the 
platform/RPG crossover; why can't Sonic?)

MY> How about that Sonic arcade game that never really made it?

Haven't heard of this.  Tell me more?

The other Freedom Fighters were invented for the comic/cartoon (only the 
Saturday one) and made only a cameo appearance in Sonic Spinball.  I 
wouldn't mind seeing them, but they'd probably be more appropriate for an 
RPG (I dare to dream again...) or in guest slots than as playable 
characters in a Sonic platformer; they just don't move fast enough.  (:3

Agreed.  Keep continuity between the plot lines, though; it bugs me that
when playing as Knuckles, one never gets to pound on or be pounded on by
Sonic, much less see the Death Egg; and Tails only gets a subset of
Sonic's ending.  S3&K would have been cooler if Tails had gotten to go to 
the Doomsday Zone; it would have been even *cooler* if he'd had his own 
special Zone, perhaps an aerial dogfight (foxfight?)

Thirded.  (:3

Then Mike Wallis wrote some more:

Is this going to be a more typical Sonic release, as opposed to the 
first-person view of Chaotix?  Anything NDAs don't prevent you from 
telling us?  (:3

Well, tell those execs that *this* Sega consumer wants a Tails game.  (:3

I'm not who you asked, but speaking for this customer, I'd buy it as soon 
as the check would clear.  (:3

Greetings, fellow Sonic fans!

I said that I would get the story out sometime this semester,
and I will!  Only in pieces, though.  Given what's going on here
at UT (going to classes, homework, partying [NOT!]), the situation
is rather busy here.  Breaking the story (may turn into small novel
at this rate) seemed like the logical choice.

Just a few things to say about the story:
-It's set to a time shortly before Robotnik conceived of Project Dooms-
 day.
-Trying to create a world that we all pretty much know about (from the
 cartoons and comics) is difficult enough;  creating something new is
 a bit more interesting.  Please try to bear with the story if it starts to 
 drag on somewhat:  I tried to set the mood to the best of my ability, and
 I wanted to help create the picture in the 3rd party mind (all of you).
-I'm a geology major;  not a professional writer!  I tried to follow the proper
 rules of American English grammer in the story, keeping in mind that 
 each writer has his/her own writing style (!)

That's all for now.  So sit back and enjoy the show in your mind's eye!

Historian's Note:

The events on Mobius take place a short time before Robotnik
developed Project Doomsday.



500 million years ago, on the planet  Cassandra, a planet far
from Mobius....

	It was near dawn in Pandora City, capital of the continent
Vulpecula in Cassandra's NW hemisphere.  The light from the star
Arcania gradually rose above the horizon with a yellow-red
glare, casting it's color over the city like a thick blanket. 
For the fox citizens that lived in the city and the rest of the
continent, it nearly time to go inside, away from the light that
they would otherwise be enjoying.  They knew that darkness was
their sole sanctuary now, for the ozone layer over Cassandra had
nearly been depleted.  The continent Vulpecula and the other
continent in the NE hemisphere,  Vulpes Prime, had been at war
for over 30 years.
	Operation Merger, the unofficial name of the war, was one to
annihilate all prejudice between the Reds (red foxes on
Vulpecula) and the Grays (gray foxes on Vulpes Prime).  The
intended ultimate result was to end the prejudice by destroying
the other race.  The basic philosophy was:  no other race, no
hate-crimes.  Operation Merger started out in a rather primitive
fashion (compared to the technology that was available at the
time) with chemical weapons that wrecked havoc on the
atmosphere's ozone layer and caused global chaos.  Nearly all
the arable land on Cassandra was lost to Arcania's increased
radiation input to the planet's biosphere, leaving the people to
starve and the biologists mad at work to find ways to alter the
food crops for adaptation to the UV and IR rays.  About ten
years after the beginning of Operation Merger, the two
superpowers agreed to use only advanced technology in the war,
attempting to prevent any further losses.  But not even the
energy weapons could stop the chemical plague in the atmosphere.
 Work had begun in the 12th year of the war to revitalize the
ozone layer, but to this day the procedures used had only been a
partial success.
	However, today was not only a day of retreat to the sheltered
coves.  It was also a day of hope and expectancy.  For this day
was one that would go down in history for the Reds and the
Grays.  The two superpowers agreed to end the war and start
working out their social differences in more peaceful ways. 
Prime Vixen Vala Andros of the Reds and Ambassador Falina Wren
of the Grays agreed to begin the major series of peace talks
after taking care of some unfinished business.
	The unfinished business in their minds was the removal of the
ultimate weapon and the technical data required to construct and
maintain it from Cassandra.  The device would then be sent by an
automatic probe into Arcania.  The Red and Gray superpowers
worked together to remove this devastating monster from
Cassandra:  the Reds supplied the weapon and technological data
(it was their design), and the Grays supplied the ion drive
system for the probe.  To insure that the probe arrived to the
star, an auxiliary dimensional warp drive was installed by the
Reds.  After the procedure was complete, the peace talks would
begin.
	Vala stood naked by the East Sector window, in her executive
habitation room of the Prime Lineage Home, located in the center
of Pandora City.  She scanned slowly over the visible areas that
she could see of Pandora City.  There wasn't much to see at this
hour of the day, since it was right before dawn and her windows
had the mandatory UV/IR filtering tint sheets on the window
interiors and exteriors, but the Prime Vixen saw enough to set
the mood for her day.  The eastern area of the city was nearly
halfway destroyed, since the major military technological
factories and bases were located there.  Reports indicated that
the attacks on those installations were conducted by a large
baryon particle weapons satellite from space.  It was a small
comfort that the weapons array was not aimed at any of the
civilian provinces.  So far.
	'This war has been such a waste for both of our peoples,' Vala
thought to herself.  'It will take decades, maybe centuries at
least, to rebuild what we have both lost.  But it will be done.'
 She put more determination into that last thought than she ever
thought she had under the circumstances, but it didn't hurt to
be hopeful in these trying times.  She was startled from the
universe of her thoughts to those of the physical universe by a
soft whistle.  It was from one of her personal communications
panels on the wall.  She walked over to it, noticing the video
display showed her faithful Prime Family Aide, Marcus Devrom. 
Vala was about to press the "Return Access" key;  however, after
taking stock of the situation she was currently in, she pressed
the "Audio TX Only" key.  It wasn't exactly good form to present
yourself to your aides when you weren't arrayed with the proper
attire.
	"Yes, Marcus.  What is it?" Vala tried to say in a calm,
composed voice, but failed at the attempt.  She knew that Marcus
would understand the reason she decided not to acknowledge him
with a video transmission from her node;  it wasn't the first
time.
	Marcus, however, spoke with a calm voice and a straight face
that belied his humor in the situation.  "Prime Vixen Vala, I
have received a message from Ambassador Falina Wren's aide.  The
Ambassador wishes to speak to you about Operation Excommunicate
and about  the preliminary plans for the peace conference."
	"Very well, then.  Send a message to Ambassador Wren's aide
that I will be ready to discuss the matters in about fifteen
minutes."  Vala managed to regain her composure that time.
	"Yes, Your Honor."
	The video imager blacked out a second later.  Vala let out a
sigh of partial relief.  Trying to stay as confident and
commanding as possible isn't always easy under potentially
embarrassing conditions.  Not one to permanently harp on these
subject matters, Vala put the incident out of her mind and set
about making herself more acceptable for public view.  The
transmission would be broadcast on every conceivable
communications frequency available on Cassandra, both audio and
video.  Vala walked over to her wardrobe, searching for
something that would be "ambassadorial", giving her people and
the Grays a feeling of power and reassurance.  Let's see:  the
black, red, green, violet, or do I need new clothes?  Good,
found the right dress.  Blue brings out my eye color.  And,
ouch! is hair cantankerous at times like these when you really
have to look your best.  Where are those medals?  Under the bed,
yes.  Now for the.....did I forget anything?  No.  The fifteen
minutes past faster than Vala had anticipated, but she was
prepared to speak to all the Cassandrans a few seconds before
one of her communications panels gave the long-awaited signal.
	Marcus was visible again.  "Your Honor, Ambassador Falina Wren
is now waiting for your reply."
	Vala pressed the "Return Access" key and said in her best Prime
Vixen voice, "Reroute her transmission to this panel."
	Ambassador Falina Wren appeared on the video display about two
seconds later.  "Greetings, Prime Vixen Vala Andros."
	The Prime Vixen displayed her obligatory (but well-intended)
respect toward her counterpart.  "Greetings Ambassador Falina
Wren.  I look forward to initiating the main peace conference
with you."
	"As do I with you, Prime Vixen.  I have received a notice from
Operation Excommunicate Coordinate Operations Corps that the
weapon has been loaded onto the probe, and it's now in
geosynchronous orbit.  Are you prepared to commence your phase
of the operation?"  Falina looked at Vala expectantly.
	"I am prepared to do so," Vala decreed confidently.  "Begin
Phase Two of Operation Excommunicate."
	Phase Two involved the probe's ion drive prestart and ignition.
 Both ambassadors and their constituents watched their
vidscreens with an intensity tangible enough to be cut with a
phased neutron beam.  About three seconds later, a brief
discharge came from the drive exhaust.  The ion propulsion
system slowly accumulated the required energy to displace itself
from its orbital position with Cassandra.  Five long minutes
later, the probe had sufficient thrust to exit orbital space and
cross into interplanetary space in order to arrive at its
destination.  The planetary and orbital support crews made
exacting checks on the heading of the probe, for the fate of
Cassandra hinged on the fate of the probe.  The crews were
apparently in unanimous agreement that the probe was on course,
for it kept moving in the same direction, unaltered by external
command protocols.  A collective sigh of relief spread
throughout the Cassandran population.  This was the first
cooperative effort between the Reds and Grays for over 30 years,
and they have nearly accomplished a common goal.
	"Well, Prime Vixen," said Falina, "up to now the operation has
been a success.  I think it's time to start considering what
terms we should discuss."
	"I agree," Vala voiced with determination.  "First of all, I
wish to-" Vala broke off her statement in midsentence, eyeing
the vidscreen with nervous and frightened intensity.
	And with good reason.  For on the video displays accross
Cassandra, the probe's ion drive disengaged without
authorization from the support crews.  Three seconds later, the
dimensional warp nacelles had a more intense field of blue light
around them.  They flashed for a millisecond.  The probe was off
course, heading out of the solar system as fast as its dimension
warp propulsion system could take it.  On Cassandra and its
artificial satellites, jaws dropped with shock as the event took
place.  Shock was soon replaced by anger from the Grays.
	Falina displayed her anger, as well as the collective anger of
her constituents, toward Vala.  "Vala!  Did you think that you
could insult my intelligence for so long?!  How would I know
that you were sending a long-range automatic probe to your
military space outposts?!  You have dishonored me, Vala!  Just
as you have dishonored yourself and your aristocratic people!"
	Vala tried to get a few words in, to soothe Falina and explain
how it was all a mistake.  However, the communications channel
closed before anything could be said.  Vala took a last look at
the city with a dreadful resolve.  For she knew what would take
place in the next few seconds, and no power in the universe
could prevent it.  The ultimate reprisal had begun.
	Vala could almost hear the military satellites repositioning
their weapons at major cities and other sites on Cassandra. 
Phased neutron beams flashed through the vacuum of space to the
biosphere of the planet.  All the molecules in the cities and
surrounding areas were broken, their bonding shattered from
exposure to the intense neutron bombardment.  There was no time
for any last words or thoughts;  only time for destruction
throughout Cassandra.  In the exchange, a satellite
malfunctioned, and increased its weapons power.  The phaser
plowed through the crust, mantle, and finally the core.  This
disrupted the core's stability, sending massive quakes through
the planet.  The instability increased until the core
fragmented, sending hot metallic shrapnel through the overlying
layers.  What was a planet became a collection of planetesimals.
 Cassandra and its inhabitants were destroyed.
	Unknown to the Cassandrans, the accident on the probe was
caused by a disrupted power transfer from the ion drive system. 
Apparently, the construction crews underestimated the amount of
shielding required for the power transfer conduits.  One of the
ion drive conduits was too close to the warp drive power control
system.  When the conduit broke its shielding and arced, the
warp power system received an unintended power influx.  The
information came too late for the Cassandrans.  They were
extinct long before the cause was recovered from a place far
away, in both space and time.

I just want to put in my support for all of Paul's comments.  As he
said, I think the most frequent request you'll see is for Tails to
get a solo game; I'd also like to repeat his call for more use of the
Saturday morning story and characters (Bunnie Rabbot would play through
a level VERY differently than any of the other characters used thus
far, don't you think...?)  Salyl could have some very interesting special
abilities, like using Nicole to summon a partial map of the level,
or being able to contact other Freedom Fighters on a one-shot basis
to help her get past obstacles ("I have a plan, Sonic!  Here's what you
need to do...")

Finally, I loved Spinball.  Sequel!  Sequel!

Well, I'll get a couple of comments done with first,
and then move on to my own two cents on a new game!

     As far as the inter-species breeding thing is
concerned, the either-or approach is very common, but
not universal.  Note, for instance, Walt Kelly's use of
opossums with skunk tails and skunks with opossum tails
for the children of Pogo and Mamzelle Hepzibah.  In the
comic they seem to have established that different
species can breed, and their children will follow the
parent of the same sex (which boggles the mind from a
genetics standpoint, but so does interspecies breeding)
On the cartoon, though, they've NEVER confirmed this,
and the cartoon and the comic share little or no
continuity - I mean, just read the latest issue.  On
the other hand, Sally's father sure LOOKS like a fox,
doesn't he?  And Sally and Sonic are sort of engaged,
which would imply she thinks she can carry on the royal
bloodline with hedgehog genes.

     As for Moebius's relationship to Earth, I'd like
to propose that the ONLY native intelligent species
seen so far are the dragons.  Please note the wildly
different biology, vaguely reptilian and marsupial at
the same time, and the only native animal we get to see
with any continuity are those little birds, which seem
to be constructed on roughly the same biological plan
as the dragons!  We've heard enough to know that the
other species have been there a good long time, at
least several centuries, but the whole place still
could have been a colony of Old Earth - which would
lead to interesting speculations about who they were
fighting the war with, hmmmm?  Not to mention the
singular rarity of humans.

     On to something perhaps even more interesting -
the request for game suggestions!  I have to echo just
about everybody else, and say that I would strongly
support more involvement of the other characters.  Not
necessarily actually PLAYED, because you would have a
great deal of difficulty playing Bunnie or Sally in the
same kind of level you'd play Sonic/Tails/Knuckles.
Still, I noted in Sonic 3 subtle level designs that
made areas where Tails could go and Sonic couldn't, and
which tended to channel them to parts of the game more
suited to their talents.  Something like that could be
employed.  Conversely, alternate levels where you have
to switch characters might be nice, or short animated
bits featuring the secondary characters of the cartoon.
Anything which really brings them into the story-line
will not only please die-hard Sonic fans, but will give
the games much-needed variety.
     Also, while I don't get to play the games as much
as I'd like, I've noticed a definite trend in level
construction.  In the first one, you frequently had to
charage through blindly at great speed, and unless you
knew exactly what was ahead, you were toast.  I've seen
them moving away from that, and would like to encourage
continuing this trend, please!
     Going back to another repeated request, varying
the plot line slightly for whatever character you use
would lend still more variety and flexibility to the
game.  Who wouldn't love to at least be ABLE to get
into a fight with Sonic?  Since multi-character seems
to be the trend, and a good one in my opinion, just
remember to treat all the other characters as equals to
Sonic, especially since I doubt most people will be
choosing the blue boy.  *I* always played Tails...

P.S.  I cannot for the LIFE of me get to the Sonic ftp
site!  How am I supposed to upload my weird pictures?

I think the idea for an RPG type sonic game with all the freedom fighters from
the show would be a great Idea. I have always loved a good rpg game (And one
with tails and the others would be twice as good.)

Hrm.  What do I want in the next Sonic game?   Hrm.  Tricky.  Alot of good
suggestions have already been made by Paul Gettle, Fred Sloniker, Jamie 
Wilmoth, Craig Moore and Richard Ray II Roberts (hope I didn't forget 
anyone :)

::: Comments on previous games :::

I agreed with Fred Sloniker about Spinball Pinball about the graphics not 
being 'up to par' (the motion at times seemed sluggish).  Still fun though.

As mentioned before, the save game feature is a definite plus!  I know some
folks like to play for hours and hours at a time, but I prefer to give myself
a break after a while. 

I always liked the ability to play the game sounds in the option menu and
was disappointed to not see it in S3 & S&K (at least I didn't notice the 
ability when I rented them... haven't gotten around to buying them yet). 
A friend of mine used that feature to tape the S2 special 3-D stage music 
(and a few other songs) and occasionally plays them when driving (very 
appropriate for a particular stretch of winding road)... which reminds me.

  Someone mentioned an Audio CD by Sega which featured some 'Sonic' game 
  music in a couple of tracks.  Is that just some crazy rumor?  Does this 
  CD exist?  If so, what's it called and where can I find it? (or can you 
  'play' the Sonic-CD in an audio-cd player and get that)

::: Suggestions for new games :::

Giving Tails his own game sounds like fun.. Maybe he can have some special
new friends as partners of his very own.  Perhaps making it 'lock-on' able 
so Knuckles and Sonic can join in too.

Sonic and the freedom fighters in an RPG game sounds like a good idea.  I
was talking with a friend just yesterday and he had brought up that he'd 
like to see more RPG style games for the Sega.

As for how can the freedom fighters be in a multi-directional scrolling game
like most of the other Sonic games? :

 Sally could use Nicole for maps and to call on friends to help her out at 
 spots.  (good idea whoever suggested it)
 Bunnie Rabbot could use her bionic legs for high speed running or extra-high
 jumping and her arm for plowing through areas like Sonic does w/ spin dashes.
 Rotor could ride a motorized skateboard for extra speed... and maybe have a 
 backpack w/ unfolding glider so he can float like Knuckles.
 Gee.. I dunno what Antoine can do.. eep.. sorry Ant (I've heard alot of 
 'get rid of Antoine' talk, but I say he'd be find if folks could find
 SOMETHING useful for him [ whats wrong with being a good strategist yet
 also being a kluts and a fraidy-cat.. I know folks like that :) ]

One idea I had which may or may not fly is this:   Why not in one of the 
levels.. play the big round guy (Robotnik)!  The objective being to capture 
some of the freedom fighters..  The last remaining freedom fighter would get 
away and that's who'd you'd play in the next levels in order to rescue 
Robotnik's captives. (once rescued you could choose one of them as a 
'partner' to help rescue others)

The ultimate idea would be to make a totally unique game featuring Sonic & 
Friends.  A game unlike anything out there yet.  Something that's not a 
platform, shoot-em-up, puzzle, sports, fighting, pinball or roleplaying game.
Very tricky... it only happens once every few years.  If I knew what such 
a game would be, then I guess I could be a game designer :)

Ok, here's some more of my opinions on how to integrate the Saturday 
morning characters into the games.

Bunnie: Bunnie`s robotic parts could give the programers a variety of 
options for special abilities. Super high jumps, Strong punches, Picking 
up badnick and throwing them, are the first three that come to mind. I 
feel that they shouldn't let her have a spin dash though, let that be the 
sole property of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. To compensate, I feel she 
should be given some kind of martial arts attack (we've seen some robotic 
grace on the show in most of her martial arts attacks, lets see it in the 
game too)

Sally: I love the sugestion to have Nicole display some kind of map for 
the level. Especially if it could be done in a scrolling heads up style, 
like in the PC game Dark Forces. Maybe also have some areas that have 
computer controlled doors, that only Nicole can open. (If you were really 
devious, you'd include mazes with linked doors, similar to the ones in 
Sandopolis in Sonic and Knuckles) As for movement, she shouldn't be able 
to jump as high as Sonic or move as fast, but maybe give her some 
acrobatic moves. Flips, cartwheels, the like. Prehaps give her a grapling 
gun, so she can reach higher areas... (or add computer controlled 
elevators) And, I know I'll take some flack for this around here, but 
include her blue vest added to this season of the Saturday Morning 
cartoon. I personally love it.

The is, in fact, a Sonic Audio CD available.  Once, after sending a 
letter to SEGA, one of the things I got back was an order from and one of 
the things on it was A "Sonic Boom" audio CD for $15.95.  I havn't seen 
it anywhere else.  I never got the chance to order it so I can't tell you 
what it's like, but I know it exists.

P.S. -- The Sonic CD game has 34 audio tracks on it which CAN be played 
in a normal audio CD player.  This is true for any SEGA CD game with 
audio tracks.

My site carries a lot of the alt.* groups, but it might be complicated
to include a new group that probably nobody except me would want to read
(the cartoon isn't available in Germany yet and most people here think
that cartoons are for kids only). It's much easier to subscribe to a
mailing list.

Furthermore, all personal e-mail I get stays forever and only _I_ decide
if something should be deleted or not. Postings in newsgroups will be
deleted automatically after a given period of time.

Please don't get me wrong. Of course I would be willing to vote for a Sonic
newsgroup if I could be sure to be able to read it. Just in case the admins
of my site won't support the group, could someone tell me how to read it
on another server or how to get all the postings via e-mail?

Thanks in advance

This feature was put into the debug menu, I understand.  I don't *know* 
because I was never able to *use* it.  Note to the Sega rep: most people 
can't enter UUDDUUUU in the space of a single second, myself included.  
If you want your debug code to be difficult to stumble on, make it a 
combination of tunes in the options menu, like in Sonic 2, or give the 
player lots of time to enter it at the title screen.

> (or can you 'play' the Sonic-CD in an audio-cd player and get that)

All Sega CDs are stored in a format that has at least two tracks: the 
first is the program, the second and following are game musics that can 
be played by any CD player.  (Attempting to play the first track will get 
you silence, in my experience.)  Sonic CD stores its present and future 
musics, along with music for things like the special stage and being 
fast, in these tracks.  Short answer: yes.  (:3

So have him show up in intermission scenes, possibly offering advice,

though.

Folks, thanks for the Sonic game comments.  We're going to be moving 
buildings over the next couple of days, so I won't have access to e-mail, 
but keep the Sonic-chatter coming!  :)

Did you know that here at Corporate we have these life-size (I'm assuming) 
renditions of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles?  These aren't plush, they're made 
of hard plastic, but they look pretty good (especially Tails).  I'll see if 
I can take a picture of them some time, scan it in and send it out to the 
List.

Also, about the Sonic logo:  I'm checking with marketing to see what font 
they used... I'm assuming you mean the typeface for the title, right?


 -Mike

Took me a second to spot the address.  (:3  All I saw here, though, were 
some Sega GIFs and your story, not even the 'Sonic and Sally' picture 
seen in someone else's FTP site; certainly nothing 'mature'.  Not that I

That's my FTP ADDRESS!  The WWW address is the other one:

http://www.primenet.com/~rotor

While I'm thinking of it, try to stay out of my FTP site, I have a few 
problems to sort out.  The Web page, however is open for buisness.

You write:

Now, I'm getting rather tired of everyone stomping all over the weekday
Sonic shows.  They are actually *entertaining* in my opinion.

Sure, if you compare them to the Sat.AM shows, of *course* they aren't
going to look very good.  But they are *different* shows, with
*different* goals.  The Sat.AM show is an adventure show, while the
weekday shows are comedy/slapstick.  If you're going to set your
expectations incorrectly, then of course you will be disappointed.  :)

I find the weekday shows to be amusing, even funny, and silly.  And
that's just what they are trying to be; nothing more.

Besides, Tails shows up in nearly every show.  :)

Welcome to the Sonic list!  Don't forget that once you're back online, 
you can retrieve the archive and find out what you missed (not to mention 
what we talked about before you joined).

It's way past cool to have a Sega representative here less than one month 
after the list's creation.

It would make sense that you would want to have model-models and/or model 
sheets for your artists.  I've got a photo of a silent-era Felix the Cat 
model-model.  How big is your Sonic?  We know from the cartoon (forgot 
which episode) that Sonic is about 3'2".

Do they serve a lot of chili dogs in the employee cafeteria? (G)

Sounds like a good idea to me.  You could upload it to ftp.mv.com or, if 
you have a UUEncoder, send to my mailbox and I'll post it on my Web page.

Hmmm.... $15.95 for the Sonic Boom Audio CD?  If is has that crappy music 
from the Sonic CD game it's definitely not worth it.  Have you heard the 
music from the Jap version?  Totally blows the American Sonic CD music away.

All right, guys!

Y'all have peaked my interest.  I want to take a look
at the Sonic and Tails picture (even though I might
hate it anyway;  but hey, I'm on Internet to expand my
horizons).  Where can I download it from?

So far as I know, nowhere yet.  I'm hoping the the person that mentioned 
it will take me up on my offer and send it to me so I can post it at my 
Web page.  Then, you can go get it from there.

I know this is WAY off the prevously intended theme
of the spirt of this net, but this is a little too difficult to
ignore.  GIVE TAILS HIS OWN GAME, NOW!  Thank

It's sick, and I will put it up because everyone is so damn curious.  Well,

As a result of some mechanical mix-up somewhere, I am afraid I missed
some of this group's mail.  I don't know how much I missed -- someone
posted something about some fan art involving Sonic & Tails but I have
yet to find the original post.  I also don't have WWW access so I'm out
on this one.

However...

The reason I'm writing: earlier in the week I thought I'd posted Chapter
1 of a story I am working on: "Bloodlines."  So far, discussions of fan
art have dominated the discussion.  Did the story ever make it to the
group, or should I report?  Please reply.

You're right, its pretty bad, and I'm not going to post it at my Web 
page.  However, I don't think it's the one everyone's been talking about, 
because the picture under discussion supposedly has both Sonic and Tails 
in it.

Hi Dan!

     I really enjoyed the first part of the story, I can't wait to read the 
rest of it.

     When will it be ready?

I posted the 1st part of "The Temporal Syndrome" either

This is my first shot at writing a Sonic story, so I want to be 
as prepared and complete as possible.  Please send informa-

Well, I'd say that's pretty sick, but I don't know if I'd say that's 
*really* sick.  I mean, it's not something I'd keep, but it hasn't 
scarred my brain for life or anything...  (:3

As someone else commented, though, I'm not sure this was the picture 
under discussion.  (The one I heard of had Sonic and Tails 'doing it' 
together; this one just has Sonic watching as Tails jacks off.)  Can our 
contact confirm/deny so I can finally lay this sordid little piece of 
curiosity to rest?

(Coming soon: a treatise on the sex lives, or lack thereof, of the 
Freedom Fighters.  Somehow, I don't think *any* of them are getting any...)

Well, I put the other perv/ image in there because it had some class to it. I
mean someone did a good job of it. 
cc-tails.gif has no class.

I will probably kill the file soon.
I hear there's another one, and mine is not the one that everyone is talking
about. I'll have to put that up too... Sigh.. 

I just don't like the tails one because it's tasteless.

sncsally1.jpg was well made. I still wouldn't show it to my mother, but I
would show it to my friends.

Wouldn't Tails look a bit 'alone' in a game without Sonic? To my opinion  
it would be much more fun if you just could select Tails as the leading  
character and Sonic as his sidekick.

But if Tails really gets his own game he should have a companion so he  
doesn't have to face Robotnik all on his own.

Just my opinion and nothing but my opinion...

I guess it's from 'Apocalypse Now'.

Sorry, but they are more boring than entertaining. The artwork is bad, the  
enemies are stupid and everything reminds far too much of the old Bugs  
Bunny cartoons from Warner (flat & superficially drawn backgrounds, Sonic  
using lots of disguises etc.).

The problem is that the weekday cartoon _isn't_ funny at all. Maybe it  
would have been a success ten years ago, but the kind of comedy people  
want to see today is different.

They are trying, but alas it doesn't work.

> Besides, Tails shows up in nearly every show.  :)

That's the only thing where I agree. I would also like to see more of  
Tails in the cartoons. But watching the weekday show only because of  
Tails... nah.

Take it easy

Agreed.  (:3  Not to mention it's poorly drawn.  Still, it could have 
been worse; I'd thought for a moment that the 'artist' was going to 
answer the question of whether two tails meant two *ahem* to cleanse my 
brain of such icky icky thoughts, I'm just going to have to write that 
Tails story I've had knocking around in my head...  (:3

I have a question: where is it?  I swear I never saw it!  Since I'm in
the process of submitting weekly installments of some fanfic myself
["Bloodlines"], I'd like to see how others are covering the same
territory.  My machine has been eating some of my overnight mail lately,
and until the sysop gets back from her family emergency and straightens
things out, I'm afraid I'm losing valuable material.  Please send me a
copy to my e-mail address...and we'll hope the computer doesn't eat it!

ROFL!!
But what is their lifespan? In fox years, how old would tails be for example?

Very good so far.  I'm looking forward to seeing what you do with my two 
original characters whom you implied you were using in this story.  No 
problem (just don't go killing them off or anything like that).  The idea 
that the Doomsday project (I assume thats what it is) fell through time and 
space from another world and landed on Mobius is interesting.  I look forward 
to the rest of it!

P.S. -- Your first try?  I'm impressed.

Brad (and all other interested parties):

I'd planned on sending out a chapter a week.  Hope it's not too much of
a hardship.  I'm still writing portions of it so it's definitely a work
in progress.  I'm also saving it by chapter, so if you need individual
chapters sent to you down the road, it'll be easier.

BTW, someone made an offhand statement on r.a.a that the Saturday AM
fall lineups have been announced.  The announcement mostly concentrated
on some of the cancellations [Garfield, Beethoven, Skeleton Warriors,
Tales from the Cryptkeeper -- those are the ones I remember] yet no
mention either way of the blue dude with the attitude.  Let's keep our
fingers crossed.

Sounds good.  So when are you going to post it?  Or are you?  If you've 
got a UUEncoder, my mailbox is waiting.  After a short review, I'll 
probably post it to my Web page.

I was telling Craig Moore about this last night so now I'll tell 
everyone.  For those of you who have sadly gone with out a 
UUEncoder/Decoder and you have FTP access, I recomend the following address:

oak.oakland.edu      /pub/msdos/decode
                            -or-
                     /pub/win3/encode

Here you will find all the Encoders you will need.  If you have Windows, 
I strongly suggest Wincode v2.61 its fast and easy to use.  You can find it
in the /pub/win3/encode directory.  The filename is wncod261.zip (yes you 
do need an unzipping program.)

For you Macintosh users, well, I don't know what to say.  Idon't deal in 
Macs so I don't know where you can find an Encoder.

To uudecode with a Mac, my favorite is uuUndo. You just drag the textfile 
onto the icon, and BANG, it uudecodes it.

it's at any of the many info-mac mirrors.
Here's one:

ftp.amug.org
/info-mac/cmp/uu* (I forget the filename)

According to my 1994 World Almanac, a red fox has a life expectancy of 
7-14 years and a gray squirrel (which we know Sally isn't, but they 
didn't list ground squirrels) has a life expectancy of 10 years.  
However, Slappy is a gray squirrel and she's around 70 or 80 -- but 
that's another show.

Quick request for when you get back: the Sega FTP site (ftp.segaoa.com) 
has a collection of GIFs of game covers, screenshots, et cetera of Sonic 
stuff.  My gripe, when I was poking around there, was the blurriness of 
the screenshots; they appear to have been photographed, then scanned in.  
Considering you (by which I mean Sega) should have direct access to the 
data used to construct any given screen in a Sega game, I expect it would 
be possible to build the GIFs digitally; this would not only give 
pixel-perfect results but also smaller files (64-color computer pictures 
compress a lot better than 256-color dithered scans).  Pass this on to 
the QA people for the FTP site, please?

Also (I hate to be a burden, but you're the only Sega presence I know of 
on the Net) would it be possible to get some little clipart things of 
Tails from the game, specifically the animbits of him helifoxing?  I was 
trying to build a little icon of the guy, but my tracing-paper skills are 
right up there with Sonic's ability to swim...  (:3

No more so than Sonic does if you're playing S&K without S3 'locked on'.  
Besides which, we never said Sonic couldn't do cameos.  Maybe Robotnik 
sets up a 'speed trap' across a section of canyon; Sonic gets bagged, but 
Tails lags behind and escapes the trap.  Now the Happy Fun Fox has to 
rescue Sonic before Robotnik can roboticize the speedy hedgehog...

I think they should have had this in S2/3, myself.  Sonic 4 should 
*definitely* allow free mixing and matching of all playable characters 
(to the extent the plot allows), and maybe even midgame swaps (Sonic has 
to decide at one point whether he'd rather keep Tails with him or set out 
with the nosy echidna...)

How about a bluebird, like the ones that fly around him when he's Super?  
It wouldn't bash bad guys like Tails does for Sonic, but it could point 
out secret routes and hidden powerups, and could also do cute stuff when 
Tails idles or reaches the end of an Act (like perching on Tails' ear, or 
the end-of-Act post) or when a boss shows up (pecking futilely on 
Robotnik's chromedome).  Of course, once Tails goes Super, it's a whole 
'nother story.  (:3  (Evil nasty wicked bad bluebird, to borrow a sig...)

(grins)  Well, I haven't submitted any, but I've considered it... and as 
Robotnik doesn't need any more excuses to have the entire group 
robotisized, and he is what currently passes for law on Mobius, it's not 
really a factor (except for Tails, who hasn't even hit puberty yet).  
Still, I don't think Sonic and Sally are, ahem, doing it off-camera; 
Sonic's metabolism is too hyper to accept a partner nowhere near his 
speed, while Sally's probably saving herself for when she can be a 
princess again and has to find a prince.  As for the rest of the Freedom 
Fighters, lack of suitable partners, either biologically (Dulcey) or 
emotionally (let's face it, *no* one wants to sleep with Antoine) pretty 
much rules out any further contributions to the Freedom Fighter forces.

*BIG* smileys pasted all over this message.  (:3

Has Tails' age been stated as 10 in the comic?  If not, we can assume 
(until they say otherwise) that the comic is simply set a year earlier 
than the show... wasn't Nicole just recently introduced in the comic?  
That would support this hypothesis.

Why do you say this?  Why do the other inhabitants appear not to be
native?

>Not to mention the singular rarity of humans.

This is rather odd.  I suspect that Robotnik and Snivelly may not be
from Mobius, because they stand out like sore thumbs.  I'm not sure why
you might think the dragons "belong" but the other critters don't?

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
**Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  At this point, there is
no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're
pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer
the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution
of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails had not
been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.

Despite this statement, controversy continues.  Identifying
Sally's species has been particularly vexing to some fans,
especially those who reason that since Sally's father is clearly
a fox, then she must be one herself.  It is possible that Sally
takes after her mother in this regard more than her father. 
Cross-species mating is a definite possibility, and an example is
implied in the "flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade"
[Sonic: In Your Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified in the Sonic-Gram Extra, vol.  
1, no. 1, Winter 94-95; I am still trying to identify a first
usage of the name.  Technically, royalty do not have surnames or
family names in the accepted sense; rather, the title of the
personage tends to serve the purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia,
is apparently seldom used (cf. "Blast to the Past," part
1).  If you wanted to be grandiose about it, Sally's formal title
would be: Sally Alicia, Princess of the House of Acorn.  But in
any event it's unlikely that Sally's formal title will come back
into use so long as Robotnik is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
**At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differs in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
features Geoffrey St. John, while another does not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  The
fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS Sega
reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series (as
reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to indicate
that someone had come down with a case of "creative differences."
In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began shipping the
week of Feb 13.


**Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!

she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik

which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
**is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  And will there be a third season?

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
**Pat Spazziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

You still got all those extra guys you see cameos of on occasion.  And

They said he was 5 in a recent comic (Issue #23) and I know I read he was 
'4' from someplace else.  Personally, I think the TV show making him 10
is the most reasonable number.

Yup.  Nicole (I think) was presented in the 'In Your Face' special.
However unless Tails somehow aged 4 years when everyone else aged only 1 I 
see no real way for the comic and tv show to both be correct no matter what 
the time you set either in.  (Okay.. You've got the possibility of 
relativistic time dialation if Sonic was running with Sally fast enough :)
[ I'm really suprised Sally doesn't have dislocated shoulders the way Sonic
just yanks her about by her arm like that ]

This brings up another question I had.. How fast in MPH can Sonic run?
The comic's 'Sonic-Grams' avoids this by never giving a straight answer :)
My best guess is "at least 1000mph.. probably not a whole lot more.. not
including 'Power Ring' boosts".  Where do I come up with this?  During the
episode 'Sonic Racer' Robotnik tested a new bot at 500mph going 'half-speed'.
It would have to be a decent challenge for Sonic if Robotnik were to be
satisfied with its performance.  Therefore 1000mph sounds we're getting close
to Sonic's top speed.  I mentioned this before but I don't think I mentioned
it to the group at large.  [ Metric fans.. 1000mph is about 1600km/h ]

Dan.. I wondering if you had gotten some e-mail I had sent earlier.
I had made a few comments about things on this list and so far I haven't
gotten any replies nor do I see any changes based on what I commented on.
I might as well post them here (at least the parts I remember)

By the way.. Antoine has a last name.
"Antoine D'Coolette" was refered to several times in the early Archie comics.
I haven't been able to track down the 'last' time this was used though.

I've never heard anything stating she was supposed to be a chipmunk.  I was 
wondering who had said this.  [Okay, she does look a bit like a chipmunk]

They didn't waste any time.  The first 'Sally Acorn' reference I saw was
in the very first issue Sonic Miniseries #0  [Mar 93].

About the Sally Miniseries:
  You stated that they were going to start shipping it Feb 13 yet I got my
copy about a week before this date.  Hrm.

> [CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

I was working on a summary of the comics (starting from Miniseries 0)..
As per some folks suggestions I'm including credits and plot summaries.
Oig.  It taking longer than I had figured it would.  I'm only up to issue
#3 of the regular series.

Here's a mind bender for you:  Since it appears that all the dragons on 
Mobius are female, how do they breed? :)
Actually, I clearly explain in:
"DAVID PISTONE'S GUIDE TO CROSS-BREEDING ON ANTHROPOMORPHICS WORLDS"
PART 2: SINLGE SEX RACES

I'm not going to post it here however, because it might be a little over 
the edge.  Some of the posts in this group are getting weird as it is.

Funny, you should mention that.  Currently, I'm working on my next story 
which is something close to a romance between Rotor and Bunnie.  Nothing 
X-rated, but it should be good just the same. Its moving very quickly 
because  it's being co-authored by a member of AOL who shall remain 
nameless until he tells me he doesn't mind.
I'll post the story here in a week, maybe two.  

[Activating Vulgar Mode]
Question: Ever wonder about what Rotor could do with those tusks when he 
and Bunnie are together?
[De-activating Vulgar Mode]
[Re-cativating Close-to-normal Mode]

Wow, that was scary ;)

See ya'!

     Well!  If people are going to bring this up, I
might as well put in my two cents.  Personally, I'm
undecided about what Sonic and Sally may be doing
behind closed doors, but while I suspect he's really
lousy in bed I don't see any reason why their
relationship may NOT go farther than kisses.  They're
pretty casual about touching each other, ya know.
     As for Dulcy - HOW many dragons have we seen?  All
of four?  Anybody too hideously surprised they were all
one sex?  Especially since three were protectors, which
seem to be female.  Who knows, though - they might be
parthenogenic.  Never mind the typical habits of
parthenogenetic creatures, though...
     Tails - at eleven?  He probably still believes in
cooties.  Really, I kind of wish the story in the In
Your Face Special could fit into cartoon continuity,
but it can't.
     I'm relatively confident Bunnie's not dating
anybody, for two reasons.  One, if it were any of the
guys in the village, she wouldn't be quiet about it.
For the other, I kind of suspect she and Uncle Chuck
are destined for the altar.  That may sound bizarre,
but think it over - it makes way too much sense.
     Antoine couldn't get a date if his life depended
on it.  Rotor - I kinda suspect he's married to his
work.  He strikes me as an obsessed puppy, although he
might be nursing a crush on Sally or Bunnie in private.

A scene from the first season eppisode Hooked on Sonics comes to mind: 
The village is having a celebration after Sonic has a minor victory over 
Robotnik. In the course of the celebration, Princess Sally plants a kiss 
on Sonic's cheek. Sonic, the cheerful comedian that he is, fakes a 
fainting spell. When Sally becomes concerned, Sonic gets up and says 
"Just kidding, kiss wasn't that great Sal." Sally indignatly replys "Oh, 
really? I suppose you could do better?" Sonic's respons to that is to 
give the Princess a very deep kiss, bending her backwards in his arms. 
Right around that time, Tails starts covering his eyes and saying yuck. 
After the kiss, Sonic asks Sally's opinion, to which she replies "It 
was....Ok" although you can tell in her voice that she thought it was 
more than that. Sonic then says "Now Sal, I know it was a major kiss, 
right Big Guy?" Poor little Tails answers back "unh-uh. Yeuch."
(the reason that this scene stands out in my memory so well, other than 
the ovbious *drooling Sally fanboy grin* is that I realized that the 
target audience of the show was probably having the exact same reaction 
as Tails)
To sum up, yeah, The Happy Fun Fox probably still believes in cooties.

Hello.

I just got the Tails picture (cc-tails.gif) from ftp.mv.com. I don't like  
it eighter. Some people must really be _sick_ to draw such things!

But another question: what the heck is wrong with the ftp.mv.com server?
I tried to get the picture via FTP for several times, but everything I got  
was timeout errors and undecipherable directories. Finally I requested it  
via e-mail and it worked. Here is the mailserver message:

    ---> RETR /pub/users/rat/sonic/images/perv/really_sick/cc-tails.gif
    150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for
    /pub/users/rat/sonic/images/perv/really_sick/cc-tails.gif (92667 bytes).
    Got 92667 bytes (78 bytes/sec)
    226 Transfer complete.

That would mean it took almost 20 minutes to get this short file. Is this  
server running on a 1200 baud modem or what?

Did anyone else have problems receiving this file or did I just log in at
the wrong time of day? And where is the picture with Sonic _and_ Tails  
doing something 'interesting' together?

Best wishes


Alessandro

I just downloaded it, and it worked fine.

I will probably get my own ftp server soon ( anonymous ftp to sard.mv.net

I don't know these numbers, but somebody on the list does (I know,

I mentioned this before: has Tails' age been given as 10 in the comic 
(not in the letters page, but in the actual body)?  If not, then the 
comic can be assumed to occur one year before the cartoon, and Tails can 
be assumed to be 9 there.

There was another explanation in a "Disney Adventures" magazine, though it
is decidely non-canon: Sonic was being tested by Dr. Kintobor (as in
Robotnik backwards), and during a speed test he blew through the sound
barrier and changed from a normal hedgehog to the spiky blue fiend he is
today.  Myself, I favor the radiation exposure theory; the first time he 
got his hands on a Power Ring, he... changed...  (:3

(He was not bitten by a radioactive roadrunner.  Uh-uh.)

Would someone be willing to write a more detailed synopsis of this plot 
and send it to me?  I'm always interested in time-travel stories...  (:3

This would support my theory that the comic continuity predates that of 
the cartoon (see above).

Rotor?  You're kidding, right?  (:3  I don't think he'd know a

hardware than, ahem, software... besides, I just don't think he's

(nods)  Agreed.  No way would they let him leave Knothole if he were 4 or 
5.  The only reason they let him go on missions *now* is probably 
shorthandedness...

Good point!  If he's going to be hauling people around a lot, he should

Pretty Darn Fast.  (:3  Seriously, I believe he's limited to sub-sonic 
speeds (no relation) without a Power Ring.  The episode you mention 
seems to contradict this, but there's evidence for the position in the 
episodes.

Wierd thought: does anybody else think of Wally West when they read or 
hear Sonic described as "the fastest thing alive"?  (:3

Well, they certainly insult each other often enough to be a typical TV 
couple.  (:3  There's definitely some (unconsummated) romance here; 
witness Sonic's demonstration of kissing in "Hooked On Sonics", or his 
jealousy of Gryph in-- what was it called, "Sub Sonic"?  The underground 
episode, at any rate...

Witness his reaction to the aforementioned kiss in "HOS".  (:3  The 
fanfic I'm (slowly) working on, though (not the Tails one, the other one) 
offers a theory as to who he might develop a relationship with when he's 
old enough to want one...

Agreed.  She's a bit of a flirt.  (Anyone who pinches Antoine's cheek has

As far as tails age goes, here it is. In the weekday show (With just sonic and
tails) He is 4 1/2 - 5 years old. In the comic and on the weekend show, he is
10. I hope this clears things up for everyone. Maybe someone should put that
info in there faq file (hint hint dan.)

   But according to Blast to the Past, he had his speed at age 5 and never
got any faster.  (Old Sonic actually lost to young Sonic.)  If animals can
walk and talk as humans can,* and if foxes can have two tails (and can fly
for that matter), I don't see why Sonic couldn't be born with his speed.

I've not posted a lot of administrivia to the list, so please take a few
moments to get (re-)acquainted with these points about the list's charter.

This document is intended to be a short treatment of the subject rather
than a comprehensive -- and boring -- list of rules.  The list is not
moderated so that you can always feel free to express your opinions and
have them heard in a timely manner, but it's also up to each one of you
to stay "on-topic".  We've not had a flamewar yet, so all of you are
doing something right.

Please send questions or commentaries directly to acme@use.usit.net or
to eschulman@delphi.com.

                                 ---------

In 1994, before this list began, most of the Sonic discussions other
than requests for codes took place in rec.arts.animation (a logical
place) and alt.tv.tiny-toon.fandom (a bit off-topic there).  The list
has seen about 400 messages in its first three weeks, making it a
much more active (and more interesting) place for net.freedom-fighters.

This list is intended to provide an outlet for discussion of the whole
range of Sonic characters, stories, comics, and TV.  During the list's
initial development, the consensus of those responding to the original
Request For Discussion (RFD) document posted to rec.arts.animation was
that the Sonic games by Sega were adequately represented by the two
Sega newsgroups.

Sonic's debut was in the games, and some discussion of them is inevitable
and even desirable.  Here are a few examples of game-related topics that
fit within the list's purpose; they are -- and have been -- welcome here.

   * Comparisons of characters.  Who is in the games but not in the
     comic and/or cartoon -- and why?  What's different between what the
     characters do or how they are presented (like Tails/Miles Prower's
     name and age).

   * Data for use in the merchandise list, such as brief game descriptions
     and announcements of new games and game accessories.  When posting
     this information, please include the manufacturer's name and (if not
     Sega) mailing address.

   * Anything in or about the games that helps to clarify setting or plot
     points that are unclear or undeveloped in the comic or cartoon.

   * The primary focus of game-related messages posted to the list should
     be characters and/or the Sonic story, not the game itself (merchandise
     list submissions excepted).

These topics are not within the list's purpose and should not be posted
here.  List subscribers interested in these topics are referred to the
"Other Internet Resources" section of the list's introductory text which
is sent upon subscribing.

   * Codes and cheats that can be used in the games, and requests for
     them.

   * Game rules and playing tips, and requests for them.

   * Requests to buy, sell, or trade games and game accessories.

   * Descriptions of games that focus on the game itself and do not
     expand on information known about the characters or the story
     of Sonic and Mobius, unless it is a submission for the Sonic
     merchandise list.

This is "borderline" but will be permitted within reasonable limits:

   * What a character does when playing a Sonic game in a fan-written
     story.  This should only be used to the extent necessary to
     develop the story.

The Sonic mailing list is very active for its rather small size.
Let's keep it busy, on-track, and flame-free.

And I loved it so much I've started using it. I think it should be the 
official nickname of our little two-tailed fuzzball.

There has been one other human, to the best of my knowledge. Lazzar, the 
wizard, from the first eppisode of the first season.

This night I did a brief excursion into FurToonia and really found some
places dedicated to our favourite blue speedster. There is a whole  
Knothole Village as well as a part of the Great Forest there. Sonic also  
inhabits Room 102 at the UnderGround Apartments.

I'm posting some parts of my logfile to show you what I found:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 102

Sonic's Game Pad

 Sonic keeps a very simple room here in the Underground Apartments,
since he considers it a temporary location.  He has most of his SONIC
the Hedgehog posters rolled up except for a new SONIC the Hedgehog 3
poster which takes up the entire wall opposite to the entrance.
 Sonic has everything in boxes except for his monitor and Sega CD which
are setup right at the base of his bed.

[stuff deleted]

Hallway (Sonic's Room, Sef's Room, Tails' Room and Rotor's Room)

You look around this section of this relatively long hallway and notice
that all the doors down the hallway have a wooden sign with their
resident's name on it.  To your west a sign on a door reads "SONIC" and
one on an adjacent door to it another one reads "SEF."  To your east
hangs similar signs, one reads "TAILS" and an adjacent door's sign
reads "ROTOR."  The hallway continues to the north and a sign over a
doorway to the south says, "KNOTHOLE VILLAGE HUB."  You notice that
Sonic's door is unlocked and almost seems inviting.

Directions:  N (More hallway)        S  (Knothole's Hub)
             E (Tails')              E2 (Rotor's)
             W (Sonic's)             W2 (Sef's)

> e

You walk through the doorway into Tails' Room.

Tails' Room

This room belongs to Miles, better known as Tails.  There's a big
beanbag in the corner, and a bag of candy on the desk in the corner.
He has posters all over the walls, including one big one of his pal
Sonic!  On the back side of the door is a dartboard with Dr. Robotnik's
picture on it, perforated with little holes.  Four darts poke out of it.

Contents:
Tails

> look Tails

This is Miles "Tails" Prower, a Freedom Fighter from the ever-popular "Sonic
The Hedgehog".  He is a red fox, about three feet high, with russet-bronze
fur and a white underbelly.  In fact, he looks just like a normal red fox
except for the two bushy white-tipped tails straying lazily back and forth
behind him.  He is wearing a pair of white gloves and large, red & white
sneakers on his feet.  His ears perk up, and he gives you a quirky grin.
Tails loves to help his best friend Sonic by traveling to diffe
rent places on planet Mobius and unroboticizing all it's furries.

You walk through the doorway into Sonic's Room and look around at the
walls around you plastered with SEGA posters (mostly of Sonic himself).

Sonic's Room

You look around Sonic the Hedgehog's room.  On the south wall there
are a slew of Sega posters, most of which are Sonic the hedgehog
and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 posters.  There's even a new one of Sonic
the Hedgehog 3 dominating the room's west wall.  To the north of
the room there is a bed adorned with Sonic the Hedgehog bed
sheets and a small shelf covered with small pewter statues of
Sonic, Tails, Princess Sally, Antoine and Rotor.  The door to
the east is adorned with a giant Princess Sally pin-up Sonic took
from the Sonic the Hedgehog comic (Issue #2, Sept.1993).

Phantom
Sonic

> look phantom

The Phantom has dark, seductive eyes.  Her soft blonde hair is all one length
and hovers gently at her shoulders.  She almost always has a dazzling smile
on her face.  As you stare obsessively at her, Phantom gives you one of her
radiant smiles and you notice her glittering sharp fangs..
Phantom is wearing a cute pair of Garfield silk boxer shorts and a matching
Garfield tee-shirt.  She has a soft plaid (purple and black and dark green)
Mickey Mouse hat on her head. There is a mischevious little gleam in her
eyes as she gazes intensely at you...

Hallway (Knuckles' Room and Julia's Room)

Looking around this section of the hallway, you notice a wooden sign on
each door to the east and west, the one to the east reads, "VACANT" and
the one to the west reads, "VACANT."  There appears to be a door set on
the ground with the name "KNUCKLES" engraved on it, and a hatch in the
ceiling with the name "JULIA" engraved in the wood.  The hallway extends
further north and south.

Directions:  N (More hallway)        S (More hallway)
             D (Knuckles')           U (Julia's)

...who, as you may or may not have been aware, promised to send me 
photocopies of some of the Fleetway Sonic comics so I could 
compare/contrast to the American version.  Along with the pages, I got a 
pack of Panini stickers (mostly small chunks of screenshots, like a water 
monitor and the victory pose of Sonic and Tails from Sonic 3) and a card 
offering a tip for Sonic 2.  All in all, it was a very nice thing to get 
in the mail.

And now, what makes this of relevance to the list:

* The drawing in the Fleetway comics looks little like the Archie comic 
or the cartoons.  If I had to draw an analogy to anything Americans might 
have seen, the only thing that comes to mind is the painting of Sonic, 
Knuckles, Tails, and the gang in the Sonic 3 hintbook.  Not quite 
on-model, but okay-looking except for a few goofs (everyone has five 
digits, for instance, and the characters introduced for the comic look 
too much like humans with animal masks).  Not better or worse, IMHO, but 
certainly different.

* The style of the stories is completely different; they seem to be aimed 
at a slightly older audience, and thus instead of the relentless 
slapstick of the Archie comics, we get superhero-style plots, complete 
with three-issue slugfests.  Also, since the stories are based more 
closely on the games, they sometimes read a little like transcripts of 
role-playing game sessions, i.e., rather dull when you're not controlling 
the protagonist.

* The basic plot is similar, but not identical, to the SatAM cartoon.  
The major difference is the change in supporting cast characters; instead 
of Sally, Bunnie, and the rest, we have Amy Rose (the pink hedgehog from 
the Sonic CD game), Porker Lewis (a cowardly pig with technical skills 
who reminds me vaguely of Antoine, but isn't nearly as annoying), a male 
rabbit (whose name I never did see), and Kintobor (a floating holographic 
head who looks like the generic egghead professor and is apparently 
intended to be Robotnik's good counterpart).  The base of the resistance 
is also a sophisticated underground bunker, complete with TVs and various 
electronic gear.

If anyone wants more details, feel free to ask me (or him, of course).

Oh, by the way: that was a very sneaky thing to do, Alessandro, packing a 
cliffhanger into that envelope.  (:3

Don't forget that _Sonic_ is the tough and way past cool hero. _He_ can  
face Robotnik on his own. Tails however is mostly a cute-looking and  
adorable fox. In 'Sonic II' he is only 6 1/2 years old (according to the  
manual) and only 10 years in the cartoon. To my opinion this is a little  
too young to fight Robotnik all alone during the _whole_ game.

Heroes don't just run into traps and then wait to be rescued (there are  
numerous examples for this). If they _really_ get cought they find a way  
to get out themselves. However, it is possible that Sonic (or another  
suitable character) would aid young Tails in his first solo adventure.  
Then in the last level they could get separated and Tails has to take the  
final challenge alone (Tails _is_ a tough fighter when he is forced to  
be). A similar situation occurred in the Tails solo story 'Zonerunner' in  
one of the Fleetway comics.

That's a _very_ good idea. But don't forget that Sonic has to look cool in  
every situation (that's his charisma). It wouldn't look cool if he acted  
like Tails when controlled by the CPU (stomping merrily into traps,  
enemies, shots etc.). If this feature will be added, the programmers  
_definitely_ have to work out some sophisticated routines to let the CPU  
played character avoid these things.

A _real_ companion would be better so they could make it a 2 player game.
But I don't see a reason why Tails couldn't have a bluebird for backup  
support as well.

Since the episodes are long into repeats, I got bored and watched the intro
to the Saturday show in slow-motion. Actually, just the end of it where they
are panning left to show Sal kissing sonic on the cheek. 

If you look at the part where it is panning, you will see Rotor and Bunnie
dancing. Do you see that? Of course it's the old rotor, not the stupid
hamburgerler looking one.

Just thought I'd meation that to support the Bunnie/Rotor potiential 
romance theory.

I'll try to decode these.

cd to /pub/users/rat/incoming

make sure you are in binary mode. (type "binary")

     Personally, I got the impression that when Sonic
was racing his 5 year old alter-ego, it wasn't very
serious.  I think the older Sonic let him win.  Sonic's
not generally prone to that kind of thing, but that was
definitely the impression I got from his sheer lack of
argumentativeness, and I think humoring himself is just
about Sonic's preferred Modus Operandi.
     There DOES seem to be a distinct shortage of
humans on Moebius, though.  Perhaps Julian and Snively
are from off-planet?  Both of the wizards that spring
to mind were human (Yes, Nagus is human - a badly
twisted human.  That seems to be a theme in the use of
magic on Moebius.), so there must be at least some
indegeny.

Sure you can.  Just because you can't *have* my ideas doesn't mean I

Have you read the Cannonical List of Prefab Plots on rec.arts.animation? 
The Sonic and Sally eppisode had a few of them. Actually a few of the 
eppisodes had prefab plots, but I always found their treatment of them to 
be quite fresh.

Agreed, though I personally find having someone's mitts on the second
controller helps out in a number of sections; there are some powerups in
S3&K that you can't reach without a helifox lift, and even some that only
Tails Alone can get.  Plus, Tails can bop the bosses without costing Sonic
rings.  But since this isn't a game-tips list, I'll return to
considerations of character...

First off, whoever said he wasn't 'cool'?  Sure, he doesn't have an
attitude problem like Sonic does, but anyone who can take out Sonic 2's
Robosonic in less than 15 seconds deserves some respect.  (If you're
interested in this way-cool-looking technique, send me email.)  He flies,
he swims, he gets places Sonic couldn't get, and Super Tails gets monster
killer death birds at his beck and call.  I'd say he's qualified to be a
hero all by his lonesome. 

Second, he doesn't have to fight *Robotnik*.  Or, at least, his objective
doesn't have to be to *defeat* Robotnik.  In the below-mentioned scenario,
he'd be trying to rescue Sonic, at least initially; another possible plot
(like platformers need a plot) would be that he's trying to locate some
exotic medicine/power crystal/wand of wishing that can only be found at
the top of Unclimbable Mountain, or in the depths of Bottomless Lake, or
some other non-Sonic-accessible place... Robotnik would keep getting in
the way, but Tails' objective would be to get *past* him, get the wonder
object, and bring it back to Knothole. 

Third, Sonic really *can't* be in a Tails game, at least not in a playable
role, if you want it to focus on the HFF; either you could play Sonic as
the lead character, in which case it'd be Sonic 4, or you couldn't, in
which case all the Sonic fans would be grousing.  IMHO.

Okay, how about this: Sonic gets captured somehow.  Tails goes to rescue
him-- no time to return to Knothole for reinforcements-- only to find out
Sonic's improvised his own escape; Robotnik's goons detect Tails and start
chasing him through various Zones.  Meanwhile, in a series of intermission
screens, we see that Sonic's returned to Knothole, having assumed the
two-tailed one made a strategic retreat; upon finding out the truth, he
sets out to rescue the fox in distress, only to be continually forced to
make detours that keep him one step behind (Tails flies up a cliff face
and Sonic has to run around it; Tails swims into an underground passage
and Sonic has to find another way in; Tails sets up a cave-in behind
himself to slow down the Swatbots and Sonic has to cut his way through...)
In the end, Tails is forced to battle Robotnik's latest evil creation, and
is outmatched, but Sonic shows up just in time to disable its impenetrable
force shield (at the cost of frying himself into incapacitation); now it's
up to Tails to save his friend and all of Mobius...

I could see this working two ways:

* Sonic makes cameos doing various useful things (like digging passages
through rockfaces or a wild spin-dash all over the screen to nuke all the
Badniks).  Possibly you could collect Sonic icons and save up his
assistance to use repeatedly on the bosses. 

* Sonic is the second character.  This is pretty much Sonic 4 where the
player has chosen Tails & Sonic instead of Sonic & Tails, but would still
be cool.  I still think Super Tails should have been able to go to the
Doomsday Zone... but I digress again. 

On the topic of free choice of character pairs...

Well, I wouldn't mind having Sonic blunder once in a while, but it would 
be a neat game feature if he wouldn't just trail behind Tails but would 
actively take out Badniks as they went.  Of course, if Sonic gets it, so 
should everyone else; CPU Tails should offer helifox lifts, CPU Knuckles 
should break open passages, that sort of thing.

...so, all two of you who read this far, what do you think?  (:3

This sounds like a pretty neat idea, but one more suited to a list-wide 
collaboration than just you and some other guy.  As it stands, I fear we

Okay, color me confused now.  Mobius doesn't have a mailing list.  If you 
mean to say that parts of the story will be communications between the 
various Freedom Fighters who are our standins in the land of speedy 
hedgehogs, you don't need our real email addresses, or even simulacra, in 
it for that.  What kind of story are you planning on writing, anyway?  
Some real-world crossover with Mobius?

I have *no* idea what this question means.  My *guess* would be that one 
is in the story under protest (that's the military application of the 
phrase), but you've already said you won't use anyone who doesn't want to 
be used...

> 5. Please state 2 skills you can contribute to the war effort.

How about our character descriptions?  I mean, we've already seen there's 
a paucity of humans in Mobius; shouldn't you be asking what species we 
want to be, how we dress, how our character behaves in given situations, 
that sort of thing?

I don't want to give very much away, but I will say this much.  Everyone 
on the list will go to Mobius and help the Freedom Fighters there.  There 
will be some simulated list discussion about the trip in the story.  I 
don't want to use someone's name without some sort of permission.  Not 
everyone will have their name used either.  Those who do reply may see 
something like Rotor asking you for help with something, or Sonic grabs 
you and takes off.  Those who don't reply or don't want their names used 
will be parts of anonymous groups.

I could just as easily get a list of subscribers and go down the list, 
numbering them 1, 2, 3, etc.  But I think names would be more interesting.

A conscientious objector refuses to participate in combat for religious 
reasons.  The US military respected this during the Vietnam War, and I am 
doing likewise for the story.

We are going as ourselves, and with the intention of returning to Earth.

The story is in very early stages of development.  More information will 
be requested as it becomes needed.  But we've got to start somewhere.

Surely you're not pro-Robotnik.  Or are you?  With Robotnik and Snively 
around, Mobius doesn't need any more villains.

Well, *I'm* not pro-Robotnik (the guy's a lunatic!), but as I didn't know 
you were talking about using us directly in your story, I was toying with 
the idea of having a *character* named after me on his side..

There are _228_ different stickers available for the sticker album, but  
each pack holds only _five_ of them. There are also screenshots of the  
weekday cartoon (the 'Subterranean Sonic' episode) as well as some drawn  
pictures of the characters / Badniks.

Not all collector cards are game tips cards. The others have cool pictures  
on them like the one with Sonic sitting in a chair wearing sunglasses or  
the one with Tails saying 'Prower Power'. The two prism cards I have (out  
of six) show the same motives that are on the SEGA telephone cards.

The Fleetway comic is mainly based on the games, remember?  .]

In later issues of the Archie comic Sonic & Tails _also_ have five fingers  
(although they should have only four according to the cartoon).

But don't forget that the _important_ characters (Sonic / Tails /  
Knuckles) look like they should (IMHO) and not like Archie is doing them  
with too thick arms, too small heads, Knuckles without the 'special' smile  
we know from the posters etc.

Only _a few_ stories are partially based on the games because this is what  
people want to see when a new game hits the market. Archie does the same  
although _their_ stories have open endings and _no_ real plot at all (look  
at the ripoff of 'Sonic Spinball' in issue #6 or 'S&K' in issue #13).

All the other stories in the Fleetway comic are _completely_ new although  
they sometimes occur at places we know from the games (Chemical Plant /  
Casino Night / Green Hills / Mystical Caves etc.). But there are also a  
lot of new places (like the 'Nameless Zone' where Tails is called to in  
most of his solo stories to fight some enemies in a middle-aged magical  
environment) and a lot of new characters like the Marxio Brothers (three  
electricians who control the Casino Night Zone).

Because the SatAM cartoon can't be seen in England (as far as I know).

In the Fleetway storyline, a malfunction in one of Kintobors inventions  
transformed him into the evil Robotnik (also a nice example for backwards  
spelling). However, his former personality got caught in one of the Power  
Rings and was implemented into the computer by Porker Lewis.

Who is the other one? If all (or most of us) will play roles in the story,  
why can't we set the basic storyline _together_?

Do you really think 'Erich Schulman', 'Paul Gettle' or 'Alessandro Sanasi'

Hmmm... I guess that means if I check 'Yes' and you put me into the story  
and I change my mind afterwards then I have the right to be removed again.  
Is that correct?

> 5. Please state 2 skills you can contribute to the war effort.

How about a character description instead? Or do you just want to put in  
our names without caring how a person would act in certain situations?

Just curious

Okay, so I'm assuming that you believe Mobius to be another planet somewhere
in this universe?  That may contradict some beliefs.

I for one feel that Mobius is the 'Earth' of another universe (similar, but
not completely parallel), and I know several other people believe
Mobius to be the Earth of the future, and they use the date references
given in the cartoon series (3xxx or something).

just more ponderings to stir...

After I posted that message, I had a thought and checked the game 
covers.  Indeed, Sonic, Tails and the rest have four fingers and a thumb 
on each hand.  The problem with the hands in the Fleetway comic, upon 
further reflection, is that they look too much like human hands wearing 
toon gloves; the fingers are too long and thin.

(nods)  Yeah, they do look a bit better, though a little too 'realistic' 
for my tastes.  And Sonic frowns too much; at worst, he should smirk.  (:3

Wierd thought #73: who decided to give Robotnik a pointy head in the 
comics and cartoons?  His head is clearly round as a cue ball in all the 
games... except for the Robotnik bean thing, which is based on the 
weekday cartoon.  (I'm not sure, in fact, that it started life as a Sonic

You gave the the first part of some Mystic Cave Zone story with Sonic and

Mobius has too many characteristics unlike Earth for me to consider it a 
future Earth.  You're not going to find many Deep Power Stones on this 
planet.  And if Mobius is a future Earth, why are there so few humans 
left and how would the animals gain human-like intelligence?

I merely believe Mobius is another planet beyond our solar system.  
Considering how many things would seem to violate the laws of physics, it 
would be more or less necessary for Mobius to exist in a different 
universe as well -- or at least beyond what is now considered the known 
universe.

There are about 40 subscribers to the list.  It is inevitable there will 
a lot of disagreements.  At best, the story will be long-delayed and look 
like we tried to incorporate everything.  At worst, story development 
would be terminated or become private (between him and me only).

Unless he volunteers it on the list, I would prefer to have his OK to 
reveal his identity.

I can use my word processor's search-and-replace feature to implement 
that, but it would be more difficult for the reader to keep track of 
who's who.  I could create 20 or so new characters, but that would cause 
a major shift in how the story is being planned to be.

A conscientious objector refuses to perform in combat for religious 
reasons.  I know some people on the list may have such beliefs, and I 
intend to respect them in the story.

Again, we have about 40 subscribers to the list.  Even if only 15 (under 
50%) respond with a personal character description, I would likely have 
more information than I can handle for an unpaid project done on limited 
time.  I will request more information as it is needed, but we have to 
start somewhere.

To know how a person would react in a given situation requires actually 
knowing that person -- or at least an interview.  That simply is not 
practical for this project.

If you would like to participate but are concerned about your portrayal, 
you do have the option to request your name not be used while indicating 
your two skills and location preferences.  That's why the option is there.

For those of you who seem to be having a good deal of confusion over 
this, I'm just going to lay it all down.

I spoke to the "unknown author" on the phone the other day and he told me 
what the story was about.  Basically, here's how it goes

We all play ourselves.  We don't design characters to represent us.  We 
play us, humans with our names (should we choose to).  We, as a group, 
journey from here (Earth) to there (Mobius) and help the freedom fighters 
on a misson or something like that.

The details on the story weren't too clear. In fact, its just in the 
construction stages as the moment, but this is exactly what our parts in 
it are. I hope this cuts through at least a small amount of confusion.

I've been doing a little thinking about this story, and there's one major
detail that the authors are gonna hafta deal with.

In most worlds of fiction, the fiction itself is not a part of that world.
Confused?  Think of it this way:  In the world of Dana Scully and Fox Muldar,
what TV show comes on the Fox network Fridays at 9PM?  Certainly not the
'X-Files'!  And do you think that Calvin and Hobbes are laughing at the
antics of a young boy and his imaginary pet tiger when they read the news-
paper funnies?

Now, it is possible to get both the 'real' world and the 'ficticious' world
to exist simultaniously.  For example, in a series of stories that I'm
currently writing, a genius doctor/biologist develops a fixation with the
comic book and cartoon series 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles', spends
most his life trying to create the foursome himself, and eventually succeeds.
And so, in the world of this story, TMNT exists both in real life and in
fiction.

Now how is the Sonic story going to deal with these issues?

If you say that the Sonic world is real, and therefore does not exist in
fiction, then how did this mailing list come about?  There would no video
games and comic books to talk about.  Could it be that some of us heard about
transmissions from deep space, possibly a whole other universe (detailing
the fights between Robotnik and the Freedom Fighters), over on
alt.conspiracy.paranoia (or whatever its called) that the government is
trying to deny exist, and so we put together a mailing list intending to
get to the bottom of these transmissions?

Now let's say that the comic books and video games do exist, and that this
mailing list was the result of them (all true so far).  So where does
the actual planet of Mobius fit into all this?  Going into the hypothetical
world of multiple universes here, I guess you could say that if there's
an infinite number of universes, then SOMEWHERE there actually exists a
Sonic the Hedgehog and an evil Dr. Robotnik, and all of the other things
given in the stories.  But what are the odds of hearing about this
particular universe, let alone finding it?  One in a google-plex, at least?
Such a situation may be outside even the limits of 'artistic license'.

ponder, ponder, ponder...

later---Kris

I don't want to harp upon this, but have you checked Sonic's and Tail's  
hands in the Archie comic? Gloves eighter far too large or too small,  
fingers slim like toothpicks... in the Fleetway comic the sizes at least  
fit together.

Only _a bit_ better?? Ok, I guess everyone here already knows that I am  
not satisfied with the current drawing style used in the Archie comic. But  
do you really think the Archie Sonic looks cool? Just take a Sonic picture  
from the SatAM cartoon and compare it to one you find in the Archie  
comics.

Sonic frowns because the original designers wanted to give him a look that  
would be accepted by kids as well as an older audience. He does smirk a  
lot in the Fleetway comic, but he also keeps a straight face to show that  
he will do whatever is necessary to win.

I just wanted to mention it because Archie could do _a lot_ better when  
writing their stories (if they would leave out all the slapstick, for  
example).

There are a lot of different Robotniks out there... check out the ending  
scene from the 'Sonic CD' game (the part where Robotnik flies away with  
the remaining Time Stones). Obviously a totally 'japanese' Robotnik.

A story that starts with a long simulated discussion might get a little  
boring at the beginning...

As I understood the cartoon the technology on Mobius is far more  
sophisticated than everything we have on Earth (anti-grav units, humanoid  
robots, intelligent computer that fit into a persons pocket etc.). In  
addition to that, none of us knows the environment there. What kind of  
help could anyone of us be except making some chili dogs (with extra  
relish) or being cannon fodder when it comes to a fight?

Earth people wouldn't fit very well into a world like Mobius. Hope you  
have a really skilled storywriter to aid you with this problem.

Now _this_ could be fun: something like a deserter who decides to serve  
Robotnik for fame and profit. Everyone on this list knows a lot about  
Sonic and the Freedom Fighters and therefore could be a real thread when  
working for Robotnik.

Well, I guess my grouse with the Fleetway comic is that they're a little 
off-model when it looks like they could nail the 'look' if they tried 
harder.  Archie doesn't even bother, so I don't gripe about their art; 
after all, why preach to the unrepentant?  (:3

Besides which, I don't read the Archie comics (only occasionally can I 
bring myself to flip through one at the comic shop), so I'm comparing the 
Fleetway version with the games and the SatAM version, which are more 
worthy competition IMHO.

I'll have to check this out.  BTW, you *do* know this is the worse of the 
two possible endings, right?  (Followup to email if you didn't...)

Why do you think so?  He has a horn on his head, a lobster claw, and
a long, thick tail.  He could just as easily be a badly-twisted
hedgehog, or anything else.  :)

Actually, I went back and looked up "Guppy" in the newsgroup and it turns 
out that on of the pictures he posted was that disgusting cc-tails.gif.  
The other one, which has both Sonic and Tails was sent to you via 
UUEncoded format.  It's a little better than the first one.  I'm still 
debating about if I should post it on my Web page or not.   For the 
record, this file is called cc-sonic.gif.

 Erich,

 The only copy my kids have is Sonic 2 that came bundled with the game, so I
don't know if that is the same as the retail version. It appears to be some
version of Kabel Heavy/Ultra. 

Read action !

I think so, but to tell the truth the computer's been a bit glitchy
lately, eating overnight e-mail and so on.  So let me address  the

I entered it this way on the assumption that "ground squirrel" and
"chipmunk" were synonymous terms.  Just consulted a dictionary; turns
out that the term "ground squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents,
including the chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  So unless she changes her name
to "Tammy" I'd better stick with "ground squirrel."

Ever seen "Tiny Toon Adventures"?  In the "How I Spent My Vacation" 
episode, Plucky offers Hamton several suggestions on what to do over the 
summer break.  One is to spend the whole time parked in front of the TV.  
Then Plucky's eyes become a pair of TV's playing the Tiny Toons intro.

In another episode, Buster and Babs are thinking about auditioning for a 
new Warner Bros. cartoon.  But Babs reminds Buster they already do Tiny 
Toons, and she does a TTA intro sequence of her own.  All the toons know 
they are TTA stars.  And you'll find more scattered through the series.

I don't want to give very much away, but this has already been reworked 
several times to get it right.

The list itself will be playing a rather minor role.  It's mostly for the 
initial setup.  The subscribers are the important element.  The list is, 
in part, what ties together people who are so far apart on this planet.

We've worked out most of the details on a certain link between Earth and 
Mobius.  Can't give away details, though, but it has been considered.

I have already de-emphasized the list for the beginning.  But it still 
plays an important role in the initial setup.

It's to be expected we have limited knowledge of Mobius.  That means we 
have to go through some training before going on real missions.  Even 
Tails had to go through some training.

I think your missing the point. "IT A STORY!!!" It doesn't have to comply with
the laws of the universe. It every story did then sci-fi fiction would be very
boring. Theres nothing wrong with useing ones imagantion is it? IMO.

Well, after quite a bit of work, I finally got my site organized so feel 
free to drop by when you have a chance.

I don't have an incoming directory yet (I still have to figure out some 
Unix commands) but the stories and images are there.

Speaking of which . . .

To Ratman:
Any chance you could send me some info on how to set one up?
For your reference, I already tried chmod go+rwx and I've been having 
problems with that.

What does this mean?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well, this is by far the worst news I've recieved in a VERY long time...
But with disappointment comes hope.  Who knows? maybe a movie will someday
be made...

Until then, we (the net freedom fighters) can continue to argue over the 
lame points of plot, species, and continuity only to ultimatly realize we 
are in fact argueing a hopeless battle that no one can prove or win... (ref: 
the 1st 150 posts)
(I was really looking forward to find out if any of my ideas about the show 
were right)

Needless to say, I'm rather disheartened over this bit of news (I think the 
moment of silence should have been MUCH longer, Dan) ;)

Also, now that the show is "offically" cancelled, think a discussion of the 
last ep.,
"Doomsday Project" is in order...For instance, even though we witnessed 
Robotnik's
entire compound be demolished, we know little of what happened to him, and 
more importantly, none of what happened to the 90% of Mobius that wuz 
roboticized!
The end of the story left so many open ends, it really is pathetic.  The 
King is still in the Void, The world is still very much in ruin, and 
Snively's companion is yet to be identified. (there are many more unexpained 
things from the many eps. of Sonic, but you get the idea)

     Oh well, I guess I saw it coming anyway.  After being moved back in the 
time slot and seeing what little  support there is on the 'net for the show, 
the only thing
that seemed hopefull was the HUGE open end of the last episode.   But since 
it is  NOT being renewed, I'm sure the writers feel sorry they didn't 
tighten things up a bit.
(A "Blast to the future" ep. would have been PERFECT!)

Hope most of this post made sense - and even more importantly - Hope 
everyone enjoyed the show while it lasted!

Sorrowfully, 
Jeffrey Pegnato

Does anyone know what the last day will be?  I guess I'll have to tape

As usual, I didn't get in on it until the end.  I only started watching 
9/94, and I missed more than a few episodes by shutting down all my 
audio, video, and computer equipment in advance of thunderstorms.  But I 
did get all the non-"Adventures" video cassettes.

Unless ABC has become totally irresponsible (they ARE running a "Dumb &
Dumber" cartoon on Sat AMs next season, which is irresponsible enough),
the season...er, SERIES finale, "The Doomsday Project" will run this
weekend -- CYLL.

I suppose this means we'll only have the comix to discuss.  Just as
well; in the last few months, they've taken a turn for the better
themselves, away from the slapstick flavor of the syndicated series.
I'm pretty sure this group will survive.

Besides, now that the animated "canon" is officially closed (at least
until the release of a motion picture...hope, hope), that makes my job
as keeped of the FAQ File a little easier.

not, it's still part of the sonic line-up. I watch it for tails but I still
watch it. If your going to make your faq file as compleat as possable then you
need to add info about the weekday show as well. What does everyone else think?

Take pity on the poor guy. Don't force him to watch something that so 
ovbiously turns his stomach. Have you considered making your own Weekday 
Sonic FAQ? (Since eyou seem to be one of the few who can stomach it....)

Well, there was a movie planned, and it was going to be a live-action film 
(ahhh!).  The script, submitted by MGM, was reviewed here by most of STI's 
Sonic team, as well as Sega execs.  IMHO, it was a pretty bad idea from the 
get-go, and so thankfully it didn't get approval.  However, I'm not sure if 
the project was shelved for the time being, or if the script folks are "back 
at the drawing board."

We've finally finished moving into our new space (and there's lots of it!). 
 After our network connection was re-established, I opened my mail to find 
just a load of messages from friends on this mailing list.  Wow!  Nearly 100 
messages just from the list!  :)  I can see you've all been busy...  ;-)

I've only seen a few of these weekday episodes because Madison only has 5 
regular channels** with no independant stations [I saw em while visiting 
Chicago.. over twice as many channels]

I'm not sure if the plots were consistant enough to make plot summaries 
(maybe a few lines like I'm doing with the comic book plots).  At least a
listing of these shows might be useful for collectors.

I heard it does has some fun inside jokes...

   Sonic covers up Scratch's eye's from behind,  "Guess who!"
   Scratch thinks about it and replies, "Ummm..  That Urkle kid?"

> Craig / Tails "Happy Fun Fox"

** CBS and UBN have to share WISC - Channel 3.  We get no WB network 
   shows .. from what I hear about them, I'm not missing much.

This is a heck of a thing to admit, and I know I'll end up sounding like
a newbie for asking but...what's STI and why do they have a "Sonic
team"?

Craig,

Ordinarily, I would consider it, but that show is so far off the
consistency dial it's over into the next county.  I mean, when they
throw in characters like Catella the Huntress in the "Zootropolis"
episode, that I could live with -- heck, she'd have worked on the Sat AM
show.  But by the time Mama Robotnik (!) showed up and flattened Catella
(!!) with the kind of flying butt slam (!!!) you'd expect to see on a
World Wrestling Federation pay-per-view...I'm sorry, but even *I* have
my limits!

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 2

     

     "And when Ah looked up, she'd just vanished!  Gave me the
creeps!"
     Bunnie was recounting her experience to the group that was
gathered inside a primitive but comfortable hut set in the hidden
village known as Knothole.  Sally, once heir-apparent to the
throne of Mobius; Sonic, leader of the group more by virtue of
his daring and speed than for any strategic brilliance; Rotor,
skilled with anything mechanical or electronic; Antoine, whose
clinging to the old traditions and protocols of the Mobian court
was almost his only personality trait; and Tails, a child in
comparison to the others but eager to please and absolutely
devoted to Sonic.  Though none of them had come of age
chronologically, they had all assumed the more-than-grown-up role
of resistance fighters.  For this group was the very heart of the
Knothole freedom fighters, dedicated to the overthrow of
Robotnik and the restoration of Mobius and its citizens.
     "I am to be feeling creepuscular my very self!" said
Antoine, huddled in the warmth of the hut.
     "Sal," Sonic asked, "you ever seen anyone dressed like
that?"
     Sally addressed the palmtop computer she held in her hand.  
     "Nicole, did you get that description?"
     "AFFIRMATIVE, SALLY."
     "Project holographic image."
     Immediately a shimmering likeness of the strange figure
could be seen floating in mid-air.
     "That's her, Sally-girl!  She looked just like that."
     "Nicole, identify."
     "DESCRIPTION OF CLOTHING IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF THE
WESTERN NOMADS."
     "Who the heck are the Nomads?" Sonic asked.
     "FORMERLY A WARRIOR RACE, THE NOMADS HAVE CONFINED
THEMSELVES TO THE WESTERN DESERTS FOR THE LAST TWO CENTURIES,
MIGRATING BETWEEN TRADE CITIES.  HISTORICALLY, THEY HAVE NEVER
ACKNOWLEDGED THE ROYAL HOUSE, AND BY TREATY THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT
ALONE."
     "Yeah, yeah," Sonic said impatiently, "but whose side are
they on?"
     "INSUFFICIENT DATA."
     "Thanks a lot, Nicole!"
     "Well, Ah don't think this one was workin' for Robotnik,
Sugarhog.  You saw what she did to those SWAT-bots."
     "That's right, Sonic.  And she could have captured Bunnie
easily, but she didn't."  Sally paused.  "And what was that about
a pin?"
     Bunnie produced the metal pin.  "She said to give it to you,
and if it meant anything you were supposed to meet her tomorrow
night at Dragonsnest at moonrise.  By yourself."
     Sally studied the pin for a second.
     "Seems to be a brooch of some sort, with...oh my gosh!"
     "What is it?" several voices asked at once.
     "This pin has the coat of arms of the House of Acorn on it. 
This is the royal coat of arms!"
     Everyone crowded around.  "You sure about this, Sal?" Sonic
asked.
     "Yes.  There are...differences in the way it's reproduced
here, though.  I've never seen these variations before; I don't
know if they mean anything."
     "Allowing me, my Princess," Antoine said formally.  "I
happen to have learn-ed all zere is to be knowing about heraldry
and similar protocols."
     "Snooze-time, guys," Sonic said in a stage whisper.  Tails
giggled.
     "I was herding zat!  But I will never mind your fun-
making."
     "C'mon, Sal!  Let Nicole figure it out!"
     "Relax, Sonic.  What have we got to lose?"
     "About an hour?"
     But Antoine never heard the last remark, as he was intently
studying the brooch.  After a minute of studying and thinking and
"Hmmm"-ing, he seemed to realize something that caused him to
react with alarm.
     "Sacre bleu cheeze!  Zis is encreable!  Fantastique!  It is
even, how you say, spooky!"
     "What is it?"  Sally asked urgently.
     "To be beginning with, note ze shape of ze shield, zat it
is a circular."
     "That's 'circle,' Antoine."
     "Zat is what I am just saying, a circular.  However, your
father's coat of arms has ze six-sided shield, how you say, ze
hexagondola."
     Sally wasn't even about to try.  "OK, so the shield is a
different shape.  Anything else?"
     "Oui.  Note ze crown at ze top.  It has only ze two layers
whereas your father's coat of arms has ze crown with troi
layers."
     "Big deal!" Sonic chimed in.  "So whoever made this was a
lousy forger."
     "Sonic, please!  I think Antoine is going somewhere with
this!"
     "I most certainly am.  Based on zese characteristics, zis
pin by law could only have been worn by one personage: by ze
Queen!"
     "The Queen!?"
     "Exactement."
     It was uncomfortably silent in the hut as Sally took the
brooch back from Antoine and stared at it.  She looked up, and
everyone could see that her face had lost some of its color.
     "This belonged to...my mother?"
     Sally didn't so much put the brooch down as she let it fall
from her hand to a nearby table.  As if in a trance, she walked
to a nearby window, leaned on the sill, and stared silently
outward.  Sonic walked over to her.
     "Sal, you OK?"  It was an agonizingly long time before she
answered, speaking to no one in particular:
     "Of all the questions I ever asked my father, there was one
he'd never answer.  He...he never told me anything about my
mother.  I don't even know what she looked like.  There were
people in my life who were like a mother to me: Rosie my nanny,
my mentor Julayla.  But so many times I'd look out of my window
and see other children with their...."  She paused, putting a
hand to her eyes.  "I'm sorry; I forgot how much it hurt."
     "Aunt Sally," Tails asked hesitantly, "maybe Nicole knows
something about her."
     Sally smiled.  "Thanks, honey, but I've tried."
     "And what happened?" Sonic asked.
     Sally once again spoke to the computer.
     "Nicole, access royal archives."  
     "ROYAL ARCHIVES ONLINE, SALLY."
     "Please display all information about...about my mother." 
There was a tense second of waiting.
     "ALL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE LAST QUEEN OF MOBIUS HAS
BEEN PLACED UNDER A LEVEL 7 SECURITY BLOCK.  ACCESS DENIED."
     "Yo, Rotor.  How serious is this level 7 block?"
     "Extremely.  All I've been able to determine is that it's a
very complex numeric code.  I've never gotten very far in
cracking it.  Even Robotnik doesn't use anything more complex
than a level 5."
     "So now what, Sal?"
     "Well, it'll take me a day and a night of travelling to get
to Dragonsnest from here, so I'd better start getting ready."
     "Hey, cool it, Sal.  I can get you there in a Sonic second!"
     "I know you can, Sonic, but you're not going to.  I'm going
alone."
     "Say what!?  Sal, this could be a trap!"
     "I know that, Sonic, but if I have a chance to...you
understand why I'm doing this, don't you?"
     "Bunnie, can't you talk her out of this?"
     "Sonic, if Sally can find out somethin' about her ma, Ah
think she should go for it."
     "But you said yourself you had a weird feeling about this
character."
     "Ah still do.  But she doesn't feel dangerous, if you know
what Ah mean."
     "Sonic, there's nothing more to talk about.  I'm going to
Dragonsnest and I'm going alone."
     "C'mon, Sal, you're going to need back-up!"
     "ALONE, Sonic!"

    Great. Just great.  One of the few non-superhero-type cartoon I can
stomach-- in fact, one of the best period-- and it dies.  Well, we
chould have seen it coming,  guys.  After all, at i's present (and
original) time-slots, it was being pitched towards kiddie type
audiences, while being written at a more mature level.
    You know, the simple fact that we had something like this at all
from one of the Big Three networks is remarkable enough.  That it lasted
two seasons (with the serial-like nature of season 2, no less) is
incredible.  Perhaps we should count our blessings.
    Well, who knows... they could change heir minds, and maybe the
poster was working on incomplete or erroneous info.
    Or maybe Snively got a place on ABC's scheduling board--- yeah,
those evil eyes were an ABC programming executive...

   The universe is big.  When you look into the sky at night and see those
millions (billions?) of stars, those are only in our galaxy.  Keep in mind
that there are millions (billions?) of other galaxies.  This means that there
are anywhere from 1000000000000 to 1000000000000000000 stars in our univese.
 And since each star could have just about any number of planets orbiting it
(only a few cabable of sustaining life I would think), the chances that we,
on Earth, are the only intelligent life form in the entire universe are
(rounded up to the nearest hundred-quintillionth decimal place) about 0.
   However, Mobius could very well be somewhere else.

I think a lot of us would like to see a Sonic movie get made, but most 
(or was that all?) of us wanted to see it animated.  You can find that 
thread in the list archive, and also see more of what we're hoping for in 
a movie.

Not necessarily.  You could say much the same about "Animaniacs".  
Similar time slot problem (but with the advantage of weekday broadcasts) 
and a lot of humor that little kids won't understand.  And to its 
disadvantage, the Fox network still has less coverage than ABC, CBS, and 
NBC do.  Yet there are 69 A episodes which have been on Fox for years.

That's true.  And who says DIC can't pitch the show to another network
(including a cable network), or go to syndication?  Just imagine: 
something brand new on USA's "Cartoon Express".  And they could use this
to build a whole line-up of new shows.  A number of prime time shows did
better in syndication than on the network, and this could be another
program to do the same (except it's not prime time, of course).

   STI is the Sega Technical Institute.  Their "Sonic Team" is the group of
people who created Sonic.  (I think it says so in the "opening credits" of
Sonic 1.)

I am of the mind set that Mobius (and the whole Sonic story) is a social 
commentary of what we, the intelligent species known as humans, are doing to 
our beloved planet.   If you watch almost any one of the Sonic eps., the 
theme has to  do with the Freedom Fighters thwarting Robotnik's plan to 
destroy some part of Mobius.  Whether it was acid rain in "super-sonic" or 
the doomsday machine in "doomsday project", it was always an issue of saving 
the environment.  That makes this a very politically correct cartoon which 
reflects us as a society.  That is what almost all cartoons are - 
reflections of ourselves.  From the dates set in the show, we COULD say that 
Mobius is an Earth of the future, we COULD say it is another planet in our 
galaxy, or we COULD say it is in another realm entirely.  

The point I'm trying to make (i think) is that you can make a case for this 
story taking place in any of these places...the goal is to choose one and go 
with it!
(this threed is getting very long and boring)

I had a very lengthy discussion about this subject a few months ago with 
another Sonic fan, and after sorting out all the facts, figures, and 
characters in the show, we ended up deciding that Mobius was in fact an 
Earth of the future.
(which explains my bias in this post)  

Another point:  this is a work of fan fiction - loosen up and have fun with 
it.  I could
post the lengthy discussion I had about the Mobius/Earth equality, but I 
won't in order for whoever (whomever) is writing this story to make up 
his/her mind on these points...if all else fails, write something completely 
original! 


Well, that's my two cents (and you get what you pay for) ;)

The universe is indeed, a big place.  Here's a very logical argument you 
can use to prove that we are not alone in the universe.

Set up a simple program that will pick a number between one and two (heads 
or tails).  On every planet in the universe, the bottom line is that it 
has life or it doesn't.  Set the program to choose the one or two about 
10000000000000000000000 times, or any large number like that and then 
have it tell you how many times it came up one and how many times it came 
up two.  The first time it comes up one is okay, that would represent the 
planet Earth.

Be honest, how many people think that you could run this program and have 
it come up one only once.  The odds of that happening are larger than a 
human can imagine.  there's life out there somewhere . . .

I still think if it's done right, A live action movie would work well. IMO it
would be great but now there may not be a movie but let's hope that some time
soon it will come out. Maybe someone will pick-up sonic before the fall or
maybe next year they will start it up again. A lot of hoping and not a lot of
fact yet but we will see.

On the other hand, there ARE big gaps in time between

These aren't really artist models, they are just for corporate promos---the 
larger retailers get them, we have 'em in our company store, and outside of 
our main reception area.  These big guys (life-size?) are just for fun.
Sonic is around 4 feet tall.  Maybe a few inches taller.  Knuckles is the 
same size, while Tails is around 8-12 inches shorter.

All true, and I for one believe that we are not alone in this universe.
(Tho' I don't think the odds are QUITE 50/50 about life existing on
any given planet.  Here in our solar system alone the odds are 8 to 1.)

But what makes me believe that Mobius is part of another universe primarily
the fact that pure magic (the Time Stones, the Chaos Emeralds) exists.
At the same time, however, I like to believe that the universe that Mobius
exists in is parallel in many aspects to our own, and that Mobius is
that universe's Earth.  Mobius and Earth share many of the same animal
and plant species (albeit at different points of evolution), they have
chili dogs :-), and, assuming that we're not hearing translations, even use
the same languages.

Another thing that makes me dismiss the idea of a future Earth is the
HUGE improbability that many species on Earth could evolve from where they
are now into sentient beings in just under 2000 years, nuclear accident
mutations or not.  So far it's taken humans 2.5 million years!

And now for something completely tasteless...

I wonder if Sonic has ever eaten any of his friends when he had chili
dogs.  Is that why we don't see Porker Lewis in the Archie comics?
<<<shudder>>>

Well, it does have its own internal consistency about it.  But I agree
that it has nothing to do with the SatAM show or the comic book.
