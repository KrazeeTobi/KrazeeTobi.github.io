Understandable.  It's sort of a gruesome thing for newbies to be running
across before they see the lighter stories near the top.  (Well, in my
case, "Bloodlines" actually drew me in, but you know how friggin' weird
I am!  =)

A given.

Ah, it's okay.  It's my fault for falling behind in my production schedule.

Hey, the closer you move my stuff to "Bloodlines", the more I'll like

Well--you'll understand in about 5 more of my texts.

I don't know why I wrote this message really, I just somehow felt that
driving urge. It in Fanfic value is a poem written by a wolf, two months
after the failed Doomsday project.

   -=3DEmptyness=3D-=20

I saw the centre of the rotted heart today,
..saw the weeds at play.
Heard the winds calling:=20
        "The cancer has fallen away."

I saw robots, uncontrolled, astray,=20
and alike those metal killing machines,=20
that lack both hearts, lovers and tasks,
I am the same.

When the battles won and justice done,
where do we malfunctioning scrambles of mettle go?
What gives us a path,=20
who gives a hell?

Where are our leaders, our commanders and lovers?
Where are our dreams, ambitions and souls?
Where are our pasts, and where is our world?

In the dust, amongst the bodies...=20
In the air, with gasses from abyssial depths,
In our liquids as the poison.

Emptyness, the dust of yesteryear,=20
emptyness our past and future,
emptyness, our dreams and goals.

I have run all over this jail-cell world,
I knew a family, knew a soul.=20

It doesn't cure it.. bores it deeper.
The world I knew is no more than the fantasy of a child,
lying blanketted in sulphurous cloud,
tapped into verses,
hidden in riddles.

Yes, as I look over my old world..=20
I know where to find my soul,
and amongst the ashes I fall.

The usual SPOILERS alert.

Sonic #33 [April 1996]
     Cover art by Spaziante has Sonic up to his ankles and elbows
in...well, it sure LOOKS biological!
     "Let's Get Small" (in 3 parts)
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     WARNING: There's no way I can describe this story without
tipping Gallagher's hand and quoting some truly awful puns he's
worked into the script.  To compensate, I will be rating some of
the puns in the course of this review, using the following
guidelines:
     -         Bad
     --        Way Past Bad
     ---       I Think I Shall Hurl
     ----      A Capital Offence on Mobius
     So, on with the fun 'n' games.  Sonic returns to Knothole
from a patrol to find the place almost deserted.  It turns out
that everybody is laid up with a microbionic infection introduced
into their food supply by Robotnik.  Since he apparently placed
the bugs in an order of take-out fries, everyone has contacted
"the French Frirus" (--).  Rotor hangs in to give Sonic and the
reader the details before passing out.  Using a gizmo left over
from "Lizard of Odd" [Sonic #3], Sonic gives himself the title
treatment and we're off on yet another "Fantastic Voyage"
knockoff.
     Since Rotor has the decency to pass out with his mouth open,
Sonic travels down Rotor's gullet until he meets...ROTOR IN
DRAG!!  Seriously, he comes across a mini-Rotor wearing a print
dress, gaudy earrings, and 10 pounds of cotton on its head.  This
singular entity is called Rotor's "Auntie Bodies" (----).  Auntie
tells Sonic she's given up fighting against the French Frirus. 
Not willing to take this lying down, Sonic continues on only to
encounter exploding pustules which also speak with Antoine's
bogus accent: The French Foreign Lesions (----).  Where's the
French Anti-Defamation League when you really need them?  After
Sonic spins past them, he encounters the beret-wearing, equally-
accented "Paris-site" (---) who tries to cook Sonic using Fever
(an animate flame--you've seen 'em in cartoons a hundred times
before).  Sonic learns that he can't punch out a flame, but just
as he's about to get hit by the Paris-site's "microbe-bar" (-),
Auntie Bodies intervenes.  Emboldened by Sonic's "unselfish" [and
unspecified] act, she conks Paris-site while Sonic runs rings
around Fever and extinguishes him.  So now it's time for the
story's DEUS EX MACHINA: Rotor's Auntie Bodies uses a single-
celled cellular phone (--) [she should have used a T-cellular
phone!] to contact the Auntie Bodies in the other freedom
fighters.  Medicine by telepathy...or is that telephony, with a
capital PHONEY?  Anyway, the sharp of eye can enjoy images of
Sally, Tails, Bunnie and Antoine dressed like little old ladies
beating up on Paris-sites.  Where's the American Association of
Retired Persons when you really need them?  With Rotor on the
road to recovery, Sonic leaves Rotor only to realize that he's
too small to reach the controls of the miniaturizer/enlarger.  In
order to work the switch, Sonic jams himself up Rotor's nose (all
together now: EEEEEEEEW!!), causing him to sneeze Sonic onto the
controls.  Gallagher may think this is a credible turn of the
story, but it's snot (sorry, but Gallagher didn't use that joke
in the story and it was just lying around).  
     The last time I was down with the flu I felt like I'd been
hit by a truck.  Still, I also knew that in a week's time the flu
would just be a bad memory.  Gallagher, however, tells us nothing
about the French Frirus.  Is it potentially fatal or just a
disabling annoyance?  There's no way that a comic book aimed at
kids would entertain notions of the former, and if the latter is
the case then all Sonic has to do is wait for everyone to
recover.  In short, there's no story.  The character of Auntie
Bodies doesn't seem to be of much help; if she/it had been
threatened by Paris-site in some heinous fashion, you'd have the
makings of a Mobian equivalent to a serious immunodeficiency
condition.  Or would that be too close to reality?  The biggest
joke in this story, unfortunately, is its display of medical
knowledge.  Where's the Centers for Disease Control when you
really need them?
     There is, however, one redeeming feature to the story which
deserves a place in the Sonic canon.  No, it's not the sight of
Rotor in drag.  At the very end, Sonic prepares a batch of "my
Auntie's secret recipe for chicken soup."  Not only has such a
person as Sonic's aunt never been mentioned (does this mean Uncle
Chuck became a widower at some point?), but Rotor points out that
"it's made with chili dogs."  So that answers one of the long-
simmering (--) debates on the list: those chili dogs Sonic's been
scarfing all this time have been made with chicken franks!
     "The Big Picture"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Penders
     And now, an excerpt [sort of] from "Oliver Twist" by Charles
Dickens:

     The evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The
editor, in his checkered shirt, stationed himself at the desk;
his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the story was
served out....  The story disappeared; the boys whispered each
other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. 
Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with
misery.  He rose from the table; and advancing to the editor, the
two pages in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:
     "Please, Sir, I want some more."
     The editor was a dark, bearded man; but he turned very pale. 
He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some
seconds, and then clung for support to the desk.  The assistants
were paralyzed with wonder; the boys with fear.
     "What!" said the editor at length, with a faint voice.
     "Please, Sir," replied Oliver, "I want some more."
     The editor aimed a blow at Oliver's head with a rolled-up
Archie Digest; pinioned him in his arms; and shrieked aloud for
the beadle.
     The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Fulop
rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing he
gentleman in the high chair said,
     "Mr. Goldwater, I beg your pardon, Sir!  Oliver Twist has
asked for more!"
     There was a general start.  Horror was depicted on every
countenance.
     "For MORE!" said Mr. Goldwater.  "Compose yourself, Fulop,
and answer me directly.  Do I understand that he asked for more,
after having read the allotted two pages per month?"
     "He did, Sir," replied Fulop.
     "That boy will be hung...I know that boy will be hung."

     Oh, and some hooded figure in a multi-screened control room
is watching Knuckles and the Chaotix.  I wonder if anyone
remembers the plot, or even cares.
     "Sonic Shot"
     Story and Art: Ken Penders
     The Mobian Freedom Fighters are engaged in a game of ice
hockey when Snively shows up with some SWATbots to take on
Sonic's team.  Snively intends it to be a friendly game, and
insists he's there without Robotnik's knowledge.  Somehow,
Robotnik discovers this and uses it to his advantage, issuing a
winner-take-all challenge.  Sonic accepts and even though the
SWATbots play a very physical game against the Mobians, Sonic
makes a save at the net and scores the winning goal--so what else
is new?
     This story came out of nowhere -- to say that Snively's out
of character is to have a firm grasp of the obvious.  The reader
never knows how Robotnik is able to communicate with Sonic et
al., is there some kind of monitor at the rink (which had better
NOT be located in or near Knothole!), or what?  Robotnik doesn't
even sic the SWATbots on the Mobians after the match -- he only
SAYS he's a sore loser but doesn't prove it by his actions.  The
writing is flatter than a Zambonied ice rink; these Mighty Ducks
don't yield any mighty yucks.
     No Sonic Grams: only covers for the Super Sonic v. Hyper
Knuckles special, and Sonic #34 (which hints that Uncle Chuck
might be suffering a relapse).  Beyond that, there are 2.5 inches
of fine print stating circulation figures which still manages to
be more entertaining than the cartoons featuring Scott et al. 
Ron Bauerle, after analyzing the figures, expressed worry that
something like 2/3 of the shipped comics are returned to the
publisher by comic shops and so forth, but Paul Castiglia got on
the list to assure us that Sonic's sales and circulation numbers
are just fine, thanks.
     Not for long, if they keep on publishing magazines like #33. 
There really wasn't much to redeem this one.  Paul C. has
suggested that those of us on the list submit story ideas to
Scott Fulop for consideration, in the form of a single short
paragraph, three ideas per page.  Yet I fear that if someone
were, for instance, to submit the plot of Michael Szal's fanfic
"Nano-Wars" it would, by the time Archie got through with it, end
up reading like "Let's Get Small."  Still, in order to rescue the
mag from creeping lameness, maybe we'd better start coming up
with story ideas for them to work with.  Can't be too hard; look
at what got into this issue: knockoffs based (however loosely) on
two movies: "Fantastic Voyage" and "The Mighty Ducks."  Consult
Ratman's ftp site for Paul C.'s memo on submissions.
     In keeping with the rather psychedelic cover art, attention
should also be paid to the 1 page ad for the Sonic-Knuckles
special toward the back.  In the ad, a blue Sonic becomes a
yellow Super Sonic, and a red Knuckles becomes a magenta Hyper
Knuckles.  Their dance-like poses remind me of those colorful
dancing bears that are a part of Grateful Dead iconography. 
Actually, their colors also remind me of the uniforms worn by the
members of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  We're sorry,
but it's time to go.

I just wanted to drop a line to all stating that I just got back on Jan 
28th from a month long vacation in Canada... and had to wade through over 
900 emails from the list.  And I was very impressed with a lot of them.  
I have two new images in the works and am completing another two 
simulateously.  So that will be four new images for the Sonic Archives.

ANy questions?  Email me at:

Et tu, Suni?

I've been toying with a story idea for a little bit now.  It concerns
Sally Alicia II, the granddaughter of Sonic & Sally who is a Lieutenant
Commander in Starfleet.  She receives word that her grandmother Sally,
now the Dowager Queen of Mobius and the last living Knothole Freedom
Fighter, is dying.  Custom dictates that she return to Mobius, since the
family traditionally gathers when one member is near death.  Sally
Alicia II, however, hasn't seen or heard from her family in six years,
ever since she decided to abdicate her place in the Mobian succession in
order to receive her Starfleet commission.  This engendered pretty
negative feelings at the time.

Though it's not part of the story I've been thinking about, Sally Alicia
II has a further complication: a human for a lover.  He figures in two
"prequels": one where the two first meet at Academy when Sally Alicia II
is admitted as the first "non-humanoid" (she is administratively
declared to be more animal than human, and "furry" is used as a racial
slur); and in a second story where he is assigned to the same ship she's
serving on -- no set plot, though I figure it to be one of those "his
last shot at redemption" kind of stories.

BTW: on the subject of relativity: Sally Alicia II is the daughter of
Charles, the son of Sonic & Sally who appears as a kid in the In Your
Face #1 special as well as Sonic #22.  He's not named in either story,
but I'M the one who's been working on these plots so why not!

Sort of like Spock and Sarek, and maybe Worf and his family?  
(Though royal succession wasn't involved there, I guess...)

>at Academy when Sally Alicia II is admitted as the first "non-humanoid" 
>(she is administratively declared to be more animal than human, and

You'll then have to neglect the animated ST series that had Lt. M'Ress (sp?)
a feline furry who filled in for Uhura for a while...  And I'm not sure I 
agree with assessing Sally II as "non-humanoid" - that seems a bit 
restrictive, given the other races that _have_ been classified as humanoid...

Interesting concept (though a depressing one) about "furry" as a slur - 
I don't remember the fan-fic "Brynne" (which dealt with a future society 
where genetic technology allowed humans to give their children animal 
characterstics) posted on alt.fan.furry a while ago as going too deeply 
into this, but it may have mentioned it in passing.  (I could e-mail it to 
anybody who wanted it - I'd rate it PG-13 for a non-graphic sex scene, and 
a slightly more graphic violence scene.)

Wohah. That's not ANYTHING like mine--altho you have a cool idea.

My idea is a Voyager Parallel. It deals with the final restoration of Mobius,
and the inhabitance of the planet find that a interdimetional (sp?) barrier
has been found that can send them to another time in their galaxy. The
timeline for Mobius is the same as yours, and the Heros of Yesterday have
already passed. Animals are already sending out ships to meet the
'humanoids'. (They're called Mamma-oids'--Fuzzy!) The little but powerful
ship MIC(Mobius Interplanitary Craft) _Voygur_ set off to find a renegade
band of the Mercenatiors (Maquis). En Route, it was wisked off, thru the
barrier, to the Caretaker Array.
  Since the Chaos Emeralds are the man source of power for the ships, and
that we already know how to kick butt in making ships, the highest warp ever
reached safely would be:

 TRANSWARP 9.95!!!!

Haha! I can't wait to write what Tom Paris's face would look like after he
finds THAT out!
And since the mammaoids can stand it with out turning into amphibians...

 The Ship: MIC Voyger
 The Capitan: Kathryn 'Kat' Hawkway (They all go by a first name basis)

I'd forgotten about M'Riss, but considering the quality of Filmation
animation I'm not surprised.  Though that brings up a point: In three
years of ST, 7 years of ST:TNG and now ST:V, I honestly can't remember
any eps where a furry played anything like a major role.  Heck, even
Lucas came around and used the Ewoks by the third film.  And no, I don't
count the Tribbles!

Overwhelmingly, it struck me that the bulk of the characters in the ST
universe are humanoid.  That's when I began to think that Mobians might
not fare well in such a context.  While Mobians might be sentient
mammals, the fact that they would be furries with tails (in many
instances) would still set them apart.  And the only furry with a tail
that was a regular on the Enterprise was Data's cat!

Of course, I don't think that anyone would come right our and SAY that
Mobians wouldn't belong in Starfleet Academy because they're furries.
They'd instead cite the physical requirements of admission and training,
etc.  (Sheesh! I think I've been following the Citadel story too
closely!)  Somehow, I can't help but imagine Sally Alicia II's career in
Starfleet being a testament to the advice "You'll have to work twice as
hard to get half as far"; I imagine her working twice as hard...and
getting twice as far!

I've no idea about "Brynne" -- our sysop has locked the school's
computer out of the alt.fan.* groups so I never got a chance to read
it.  The Mobius/Trek crossover stories aren't being seriously worked on
(yet), so don't post Brynne to me, especially if it's of a serious
length.

If you are getting this from one of Antoine's lines in "Spyhog" (the episode
where he is captured and Snively tortures him by mis-preparing food), I
believe he says he is from "d'Aliment", which, of course, means "of food" in
English.  (Well, _I_ thought it was a clever pun. But then again, I'm a real
sucker when it comes to bad puns, which is one of the things I find charming
about the Sonic comics and toons.)

Dave:

Overcaution is, alas, one of my main vices.  Even I did not believe what I
wrote was a "flame", but past experience dictated my disclaimer at the top
of my reply as necessary.  However, it is good that you were merely 
being sarcastic at the time you put the one line troll at the bottom of
your message; probably anything less than a full apology from you if you 
had tried to reply to me would have caused me to become unpleasant.

Ol' Joe's been a hair-trigger lately, to put it lightly.  All of the
various idiotic C-SPAN coverage of the Second Coming of Exon, a bad
head cold, unpleasant scholastic experiences, and some various other
minor irritations have gradually worn my fuse down to a tiny, tiny nub.
I'd bet that unless I get a good dose of NyQuil here pretty soon, I'm
going to have to go medieval on some people's buttocks.

Sharpening my Swiss Army Knife,

Joe.

Thanks for the post.  I haven't been too up on Voyager, if only because
it's not adequately represented on my local cable system...at least, at
anything like a reasonable time.

I also couldn't picture Mobian society as a whole getting hopped up
about space travel.  That's why I thought up having only one Mobian in
Starfleet.  Then I couldn't help thinking up the various complications
mentioned in the plot.

Finally, if you're familiar with Disney furries, have I got a .jpg for
YOU:  check it out at:

Let me know if you need a who's who.

A few things, actually ......  (Archie KIND OF covered this one, but..) 

1) How did Tails actually get his two tails?  (there's like, 50 different 
stories for this.....)

2) Are Mobius & Earth connected in any way?

3) How did Sonic here of rock?  I mean, there aren't too many influences 
on Mobius, yet he likes the "heavy metal" ("TAL") scene.  

4) Mobius is obviously a cross between REAL biological creatures and 
mythical ones... (case in point, Dulcy,) if this is true for the FREEDOM 
FIGHTERS, why would it not be true for Robotnik?  (Now THAT'D be a robot 
army!  A bunch of Litches, Trolls, Crystal Dragons!)  

5) (And this I don't get...) Sally wears boots and a top, yet no 
"pants"....I understand they to be cartoons, but is this a fashion 
statement?  The only thing he wears, (Sonic) is boots and gloves...but 
for good reason.

6) Does Sonic have a band?

           Well, there's a few to get the ol' list movin' again!  BTW- if 
you see something here that was here before...no shows, please! :)

My opinion on the subject is that Tails is a kitsune.  (In the name of
"Bob", who made up this wacked-out theory about Antoine?  Do you think
he'd give a toenail for "ze common-ar" Tails?  Honestly, how silly.)
Being a mythical creature, one could justify a race of them (albeit
small) on Mobius.

>2) Are Mobius & Earth connected in any way?

The popular theory is that they are, though I haven't decided if I
personally subscribe to that belief.  If I ever do, I have a new
subarc I could run in my continuing storyline about it.

>3) How did Sonic here of rock?  I mean, there aren't too many influences 
>on Mobius, yet he likes the "heavy metal" ("TAL") scene.  

Probability states that a music style such as rock could develop
independently (over time) on several different worlds with intelligent
life.  Or maybe they heard it from a visiting alien species.  *shrug*

>4) Mobius is obviously a cross between REAL biological creatures and

Because Robotnik hates magic. (Kinda.) He hates dragons especially, as 
several fanfics have shown, and would like to either have them all killed or
roboticized.  Actually, a more truthful statement would be that Robotnik
hates magic he can't *control*.  And since I've never seen anyone *want*
to be roboticized....

>5) (And this I don't get...) Sally wears boots and a top, yet no 
>"pants"....I understand they to be cartoons, but is this a fashion

*slips semi-in character*

Ah, the infamous "I'm not wearing any pants!" thread.  Well, my opinion
on that topic is that it wouldn't be real classy for Sally to just wear
her Wonderbra [tm] (what?  you didn't know?) around Knothole.  Some sort 
of Princess thing, I dunno.  Me, I wouldn't mind.  I don't go out much, 
anyway...but it might lead to an unnerving trend.

Of course, I'm not from around those parts.  Maybe Sandra would know.

*returns to normal*

>6) Does Sonic have a band?

The real question is, who would be *in* it?  What would they play?
Would they live in a multicolored bus?  ;)

>           Well, there's a few to get the ol' list movin' again!  BTW- if

I'm not the FAQ-keeper, anyway.  ;)

Read the FAQ File.

Not directly.  Some have posited that Mobius is some kind of
post-Holocaust Earth, in which case somebody would have to come up with
some kind of archaeological evidence...kinda like the final scene in
"Planet of the Apes."

No definite answer, but who's to say what the popular music scene was
like on Mobius before the takeover?

Robotnik is into exploitation/mechanization.  He doesn't appear to have
the imaginative capacity to tap into any kind of occult action.  He's
not like Darth Vader, who is plugged into the dark side of the Force.
This probably explains why he banished a wizard, Naugus, to the Void:
not being able to control that kind of power himself, he gets rid of
those who can.

Proof once again that furries are Not Clear On The Concept(tm) when it
comes to clothing.  Sally didn't even bother with the vest the first
season; in the comics, she acquires the vest as part of the effects left
to her by her mentor, Julayla, upon the latter's death (cf. In Your Face
#1).  Antoine is the most overdressed of the Knothole freedom fighters,
though with him it's a status thing.  Bunnie's "one-piece swimsuit" has
only one purpose that I can tell: silencing the critics and heading off
the censors ;-) .

A story in Sonic #8 had him putting a band together, but it hasn't been
heard from since.

There's a word to describe some broken CPUs, terminals, and other
computer parts: "landfill."  Thanx, PC Magazine.

Q11: What exactly are those chili dogs made of?

Q11: What exactly are those chili dogs made of?
A:   When a story is set on a planet populated by sentient
animals, the question of their eating habits is no small matter. 
How would a planet whose population would include intelligent
cows and pigs deal with the subject of eating something usually
thought to be made out of pork and/or beef?  While several
members of the Sonic mailing list have suggested that the dogs in
Sonic's chili dogs are fashioned from some meat analog, a
possible answer appeared at the end of "Let's Get Small" (Sonic
#33).  In the last panel, Sonic whips up a batch of chicken soup
which, Rotor explains, is "made with chili dogs."  Since you
can't very well call it "chicken soup" if it doesn't contain any
chicken, it would appear that those chili dogs Sonic has been
scarfing for all these years are made using chicken franks!  At

OK, I've *finally* finished the second in my Sonic Kids series. This one is
of Bunnie, sitting down and looking into the dark woods at night. It can be
found at:
http://rat.org/pub/sonic/images/drawn/bunni-sl.jpg
The first one, if you're interested, can be found there as rotor-sl.jpg
Next up? Probably Tails. I'm still curious to see what I can come up with
for diapers for a fox with two tails. ;) (Yes, I know. It's been done but
*I* haven't seen it, and I'd rather make some attempts myself before being
influenced by any other's work on the same. The models for the first two
came from the Blast to the Past episodes BTW.)

Since I play one, and have one featured on my web page, I'll answer that.
	A kitsune (multi-tailed fox) is a magical creature, according to 
Japanese Mythology. The more tails they have, the more magic, power, and 
rank they have (nine is the max). But also, the more tails they have, the 
more corrupt and evil they are. That's all I understand about it.

A kitsune, in a nutshell, is a mythical multi-tailed (two or more) fox.
They're supposed to have magical powers 'n stuff.

After reading several of the postings and checking out some of the SONIC
web-sites, as one of the main writers (and sometime artist) on Archie's SONIC
series, I thought I'd give a behind-the-scenes peek of what goes on in the
making of a typical issue.

Actually, there isn't any such animal as a typical issue, as each story is a
unique entity unto themselves. We're always trying to come up with something
different, fun and exciting that tops what we've already done. Hopefully,
people are going to have fun and enjoy the finished work when it comes out.

Readers have inquired into many aspects about the world of SONIC, especially
aspects of the characters and the continuity of the stories as they relate to
each other. Mike Kanterovich and I have always taken the attitude that
writing SONIC and his friends should be approached as if we were writing
BATMAN or SPIDER-MAN. That is, this a character that people like and we are
just mere chroniclers of his adventures. We never treat it as if it were just
another job, or "only" a funny animals story. 

There are some aspects in writing the book that are simply beyond the control
of the editors at Archie Comics or we the writers. SEGA has the final say on
everything, even if they contridict themselves. I've recently seen SONIC
comics that were produced in Britain. My initial reaction ranged from one of
envy, because for many and various reasons, we simply can't do stories like
that for Archie, no matter how much we may want to, to feelings of disbelief,
that SEGA would allow stories published where SONIC appears so "off-model".
If you only knew how many times the artists at Archie have been told to
correct the spines on SONIC because the drawings looked off-model, and then
along comes offically approved stories that feature drawings that came out of
a Mike Gallagher script. (No disrepect to Mike is intended or inferred, as
I'm sure he'd be the first one to agree.)

One aspect that's been very difficult to handle has been the issue of
continuity. Mike and I have always tried to keep our stories within the
established framework while adding new pieces to the puzzle, so to speak, and
in the course of producing SONIC'S adventures, it's just not possible to be
aware of what every writer on every SONIC story is up to, so there are going
to be inconsistencies from time to time. I've just turned in the script for
issue #44. There's a chance I may have to make a revision or two based on
what occurs in #43. (The scripts I turned in for #38 and 39 were pushed back
to #41 and 42, respectively.) Right now, I've submitted a plot synopsis for
ENDGAME, a four issue spectacular that begins in issue #47 and concludes in
#50, with an ending that changes the status quo in SONIC considerably. As a
matter of fact, a harbinger of things to come can be found in SONIC #36 as
well as the KNUCKLES mini-series.

Speaking of KNUCKLES, I'd like to clarify a point here for the confused and
frustrated. The 2-page stories as seen in issues #31 through #33 were NOT
part of the story originally. The 8-page stories you will see in #34 through
36 WERE what was SUPPOSED to be there. What happened was this:

Comics are solicited to the comics shop months ahead of time. Retailers place
their orders based on what they believe they can sell. Whatever they order,
they HAVE to buy. If Archie promises a KNUCKLES story in an issue of SONIC,
and the retailer orders the book based on the information he has been
provided with, and the book appears with NO KNUCKLES story, then the retailer
can return the book. With me so far? Okay then. Archie promised KNUCKLES
stories in SONIC #31 through #33. AFTER these books were solicited to the
retailers, word came in that a traditionally NON-COMICS BIG TIME retailer
wanted to carry the KNUCKLES MINI-SERIES. The ONLY way this could be done was
if the series release date was PUSHED BACK three months. Scott Fulop, then
editor of SONIC, had only days to turn in issue #31 to the printers. He had
to make a decision and he had to make it quick. There WASN"T any way he could
get an all-new story written and drawn and APPROVED BY SEGA in under a week's
time. It's just NOT possible. So he asked Mike and I to do two-page fillers
to keep the story going so we could by-pass the process in having to get
another story approved. Since 2 pages was all that could be written,
pencilled, lettered, inked and colored in the alloted time in order to get
#31 to the printers, it was decided to stick to that format for the next two
issues. Nobody was happy with this. Scott, Mike and I anticipated that
readers would feel cheated with this, but we hope when they get to the full
stories, all will be forgiven.

I've received some mail on the stories we do, and I've found that writing for
SONIC is quite a balancing act. Take "Sonic Shot" in issue #33, for instance.
For the most part, the younger readers liked it, while some adults thought it
bland. In this case, I'd have to go with the opinions of the younger readers
because it was they who inspired the story and for whom it was intended. For
those who criticized that some parts stretched credulity because, for
example, it wasn't possible for Robotnik to communicate with SONIC as shown,
my answer is this. I only had EIGHT pages to play with. I decided to focus on
plot, pacing, fun and sportsmanship. If I had a page or two more,  I could've
gone into more detail, but sometimes part of what gets you through a story is
by letting the readers fill in the blanks. While Mike and I generally go for
a more middle-of-the-road approach in aiming the stories at both younger and
older readers, the fact of the matter is that a LOT of SONIC readers are
primarily a younger audience, and once in awhile we'll do something
specifically for them.

If anyone has questions they'd like to field my way, feel free to do so. If
you have story ideas for submission to Archie, by all means, I encourage you
to try. You may get lucky. One word of caution: we're in the midst of
planning stories that take us to issue #60. No scripts have been planned or
written after #50 as yet, but issue #50 does present some really special
surprises in store for the readers, so any writer interested in submitting
should be prepared to make whatever changes necessary to the story to conform
with the continuity as it's being set up. (And no, I'm not going to give the
game away at this point.)  

Take care and thanks for your interest.

But wasn't one of Robotnik's sidekicks (based on the yukky syndicated

Stories STORIES!!!!!  There is so many good storys out the it would make your
head spin.  If there was a direct E-mail to Sonic Grams then it would be
easier to just send them.  I don't find it fun to mail a 10 page story and
jam it into a envolope.  It just doesn't fit.

Dear Paul:

I read with interest your comments about submitting stories to comic
publishers (specifically Sonic, and "jamming a 10 page story into an
envelope").  You should know that, in general, there are just not enough
hours in the day for an editor to even hope to be able to read a 10 page
submission (especially Sonic-- which is more than a full time job-- I know, I
used to edit it and the work load as well as dealing with SEGA was
never-ending).  That's why we (and all other comic publishers, for that
matter) encourage those submitting scripts to send short synopses (of 2-3
paragraphs) only.  I feel it's important for people on the outside to
understand what it's like on the inside-- it's not a personal slight if an
editor doesn't read your 10 page manuscript; just an impossibility due to
time constraints.  Hope this clears that up for you...

You're thinking of Scratch, he of the annoying laugh.  Hey, I'm just

The good news is, you don't have to do a 10-page treatment.  If you'll
read Paul Castiglia's memo on submitting story ideas (located in
Ratman's ftp file), you'll find that story ideas are to be submitted in
ONE PARAGRAPH.  He says that this is due to the pressures of the job of
editor.  I trust that this isn't a statement about Scott's attention
span ;-) .

TO:  Ken Penders

WE'RE NOT WORTHY!!!
WE'RE NOT WORTHY!!!

Seriously, Ken, thank you very much for your post.  Speaking as one of
the resident critics of the comic, I appreciate the insight your post
afforded.  Particularly the situation involving the Knuckles story and
why it had to be dribbled out with 2-page teasers.  Knowing now what I
didn't know then, I think it safe to say that the REAL story will be an
improvement.

I can sympathize with the problem of deadlines.  Your post also leans
toward confirming a pet theory of mine: that some behind-the-scenes
shortstopping by SEGA doesn't help matters.  I take it this happened
with the Sally miniseries and delayed its roll-out.

Your statements about future developments are...tantilizing, to say the
least.  If you've done any browsing of the fanfic you know that a number
of us have our own notions, pet theories and ideas as to which way the
stories should go.  Not all of them, of course, are suitable for Archie,
but this lets you know how one segment of Sonic fans thinks about the
characters and situations.

Thanks again for taking the time,

They can be sent via email, but in all honesty we have no need for new

same.

It took me a second, but I figured it out :^)

I hope Ken doesn't take personally any of the criticism of his stories and 
art that's shown up here on the list, which leads me to my next comments:

>From: Benny7dude@aol.com
>Subject: comic story submissions

>You should know that, in general, there are just not enough hours in the

>(especially Sonic-- which is more than a full time job-- I know, I used

I hope the sense of creating something entertaining made/makes up for all the 
work, but I can't help feel that the list conveys a sense of never being 
able to please us - if it's not the stories, it's the art, etc.

Please know that your efforts _are_ appreciated; Sonic is the only 
regularly published furry comic out these days, and given that you have to 
make money on it (i.e., meet tough schedules), plus please a wide age range,
plus deal with the owners of the characters, _almost_ makes me glad I'm in 
the locomotive building business vs. the comic publishing business (OTOH, 
I seldom hear praise from _our_ customers (and managers) either - the 
locomotives are late, too expensive, or unreliable, etc.).

Keep up the good work!

Ken, thanks for backing me up in this.  The fact is, nearly 85% (if not more)
of Sonic's many readers ARE the younger audience.  While it's great that the
remaining percentile (many of whom subscribe to this mailing list) are adults
who are enthralled with the more complex aspects of the Sonic mythology, it's
important for everyone to know that in the interest of fairness, the younger
(and more prevalent) audience's needs must also be met.  Hence, Sonic stories
aimed at a variety of age groups in our comics.  We aim to please all...

Actually, Scott's attention span was pretty good. In fact, all the Archie
editors are a considerate bunch. If they haven't responded to any inquiries
personally, it's not because they don't want to or can't be bothered, but the
simple fact that the workload is a backbreaker.  So take pity, okay?

Regarding the issue of chili-dogs, they're made from soybeans or some form of
seafood by-products, and let's leave it at that! Sheeeesh! Some things are
better off left alone. Just like inter-species crossbreeding. If hybrids like
Mr Spock are accepted, I can buy into this regarding Sally and Sonic and any
children they may have. I just don't want to dwell on the mechanics or feel
it's necessary to. If someone wants to debate this point, I'm game.

To Dan:

Feel free to express your comments and criticisms whenever you like. I think
some of it is valid and other parts uninformed. However, lots of other people
aren't aware of what goes on in the production of the comic series unless
they're one of the few involved, so I understand when the comment made is
such. The problem is I don't have the time to always correct the record. I
accept this, don't get offended when you don't like something, and try to
make my next story better than the last.

One thing that makes writing SONIC (and Archie titles in general) harder than
say, your average super-hero title, is that we CAN'T do continued stories
whenever we like. Most stories have to fit in whatever page count we're
alloted, whether it's 8, 11, 16 or 24 pages. The writers don't have the
luxury of being able to prolong the action like you see in your average DC or
Marvel comic where one story can take up to half a year or more worth of
issues. 

The writers also sometimes have to jettison a story they'd rather work on in
favor of one the editor or a SEGA representative wants to see done, because
that is the direction they want the book to go in. The writer may make
suggestions, and if it's a good day, hopefully the editor will be receptive.
(In most cases, they usually are.)

That the PRINCESS SALLY mini-series came out at all is a minor miracle. Not
quite on the level of the Beatles reuniting, but close. Scott was pulling his
hair out during the entire process doing his best to keep things moving
along. In fairness to the people at SEGA, they wanted to create a viable
environment where the public would be anticipating more PRINCESS SALLY
products such as a her own video-game or line of t-shirts or whatever, and
the comic series represented the beginning of that, so it was important to
them that it was done the best it could be. The sad part was fan reaction was
VERY positive, but poor distribution resulted in poor sales. I'd still like
to do another SALLY mini-series.

Regarding browsing any SONIC fan fiction, I'm afraid I won't be reading any
until I'm no longer working on SONIC. We already have a game plan mapped out
for the forseeable future, and if I use something somebody has already
written, I run the risk of appearing to have borrowed from another writer's
ideas. My apologies for this policy, but I hope you understand. Thanks for
your interest.

Ron -

No, I don't take the criticism personally. At least you understand it's a
difficult process to put together an issue of SONIC. Mike Kanterovich and I
may not always hit the mark, but we try our best to make everyone happy. Feel
free to express your comments and criticisms anytime. If I feel a criticism
valid, it's useful in helping to do better the next time. 

BTW, my son and I are big train fanatics, which is where "A ROBOT RIDES THE
RAILS" in SONIC #31 originated from. I'd been dying to write and draw a story
with a train in it for a long time, and this represented the perfect
opportunity. My only regret is we didn't have a couple of more pages so I
could've featured more detailed shots of the train itself.

Hmm.. Wasn't there some aesop fable about not being able to please everyone?
I think the solution would be to make 2 comics. One for young audiences, and
another for older. Of course that might not be cost effective, which is 
probably why it's not being done already.

Well, there was the one about the man with two wives: one older, the other 
younger.  The former liked his gray hair, and would comb it and pick out the 
black ones; the latter liked his black hair, and would comb it and pick out 
the gray ones.  He ended up bald :^)

I don't remember the wording of the moral though...

Put another way: there aren't enough older readers to sustain a comic just for
them - look what happened to other furry comics (e.g., Captain Carrot, etc.)

They say you can't please all the people all the time, but you can please 
all the people some of the time (whereas you can and now do please some 
of the people all the time).

The market may not be able to sustain 2 regular comics, but it may be 
able to sustain the present comics plus a quarterly comic geared towards 
the older readers.  The quarterly comic can also be a little bigger so 
stories can be done in greater depths.  I'm thinking of something around 
the size and page count of the Archie Digests.  Some existing advertisers 
will cross over, but Archie will get a chance to recruit new advertisers 
who, to now, would never have given Archie Comics a second look when 
trying to find places for their advertising dollars because the present 
demographics are all wrong for them.  You will also give today's younger 
readers something to "graduate" to.  It's better they remain your 
customer 4 times a year than 0 times a year, and their patronage may 
continue to or past college graduation.  You could also offer a $2 
discount on subscriptions for those who want to subscribe to both the 
regular monthly and to the quarterly (a $1 discount off each).  The 
"Generation X" crowd has a rep of being hard to sell to, but with plenty 
of forethought and planning, you can probably find a way to make the most 
of a market that definitely exists.

The PRINCESS SALLY mini-series just didn't do well enough to warrant another
shot. From what we can tell, it seems there was a problem with distribution
which prevented a lot of people from finding and picking up the book. You
also had the core audience of little boys that felt awkward picking up a
title that they felt was aimed more at girls. However, when you plopped a
copy into their hands and made them read the first issue, that's all it took.
They were hooked.

We received a lot of applause from various fans who did read the books and
liked what we did. Both Mike and I wanted a more serious tone to the series
to make it just different enough to justify having it stand on its own.

If you liked the PRINCESS SALLY mini-series, you're going to love the
upcoming KNUCKLES mini-series. We did some pretty hair-raising things in
those stories. In fact, it gets downright apocalyptic. Mike and I just shook
our heads after we submitted those scripts because we thought SEGA would blow
us out of the water and they didn't. We're looking forward very much to your
reactions once the story starts unfolding in SONIC #34.

This is in response to those who suggest a SONIC series geared toward older
readers while letting the younger readers have their version.

Economics is not the driving force here. The main factor is what is best for
the corporate interests. Let's start with Archie, because they're a basic,
bottom-line company. Archie is Disney, pure and simple. When they veer into
other things is comparable to Disney using Miramax or Touchstone or Hollywood
Pictures as a smokescreen to do non-traditional Disney fare. Disney is many
times bigger, granted, than Archie, but what both companies are founded on is
good, clean wholesome family fun. You KNOW what to expect from an Archie
comic. Even when he met the Punisher, it was Archie's established style that
set the tone for the book. 

Then you have SEGA, which created SONIC as an answer to Nintendo's SUPER
MARIO. (Remember them?) Sonic became popular with game players of all ages,
especially kids, and so SEGA sought to cement that family image with a
product produced by Archie Comics. Not DC. Not Marvel. Not even Image or Dark
Horse. It wasn't until after Mike and I wrote "THIS ISLAND HEDGEHOG" guest
starring Knuckles that SEGA began re-evaluating their attitudes about how the
characters should be handled. We submitted a sequel to "TIH" titled simply
"RETURN TO THE FLOATING ISLAND", featuring more elements of the SONIC 3 game
that didn't make it into issue #13. SEGA put that story on-hold, as they were
trying to figure out how to market KNUCKLES to an older teen crowd. By this
time, especially with the Saturday morning cartoon rating really high with
the kids, it became clear that anything that featured SONIC and his pals was
going to be scooped up by the kid crowd. If we had put out a KNUCKLES book
aimed at an older teen crowd, the parents of the pre-teen set would be out
for blood, because here they would've bought a product they thought was
appropriate for their little ones. The people at Archie knew this and
resisted efforts to push toward the older crowd. Mike and I were among those
that supported Archie in this. Sure, it meant we couldn't do some things we
would have liked to, but it did force us to get more creative in our approach
to the material.

I have an 8-year-old son who was very much into SONIC, even before his dad
started writing the book. In fact, it was his interest that led me to take
the assignment of writing the stories. He's my barometer of what type of
stories to do and how far I can push the envelope. I also have many friends
with children who read the stories to their children. Their comments are
always carefully considered when I try to incorporate an idea or concept that
might be too "adult" for the book. I'm always striving for the balance.

If one chooses to, one can go back and reread the stories Mike and I have
done on a number of levels. For example, "IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT", I had a
number of mothers read this story to see if we handled the subject of death
appropriately enough. Not one objected. Not one. On the other hand "FIRST
STAR I SEE TONIGHT" elicited knowing laughs from the same audience at the
appropriate moments. Then there's the concepts of other dimensions, parallel
universes, time travel and other science fiction staples. I try to make
certain the concept can be grasped easily enough by the non-science fiction
fan, but it gets tricky. 

If this is not quite what you were hoping for, at least there is a book that
can be enjoyed with the possibility of expanding the envelope wherever and
whenever we can. (All within the boundaries of good taste, of course.)

And you're both to be congratulated for it.  While I may not have said
as much in so many words, "Deadliest of the Species" represented very
strong writing.  As someone else observed, it was one of the most
complex plotlines to appear in the comics and yet it managed to retain
readers' interest.  It deserved a better fate; I can be a witness that
in my corner of the country (southwestern Michigan), I really wasn't
sure where or when to find it on the stands.  I ended up sending away
for all three issues.

I'd like your permission to quote from some of your posts and revise FAQ
#7: "What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?"  I'd never thought
that we'd get an answer to the question straight from Archie: I pretty
much had the Sonic-Gram in Sonic #21 and the ads for the miniseries in
Sonic #22 to go on -- kinda like when the CIA used to try figuring out
who's on first in the USSR from who stands where on top of Lenin's Tomb
during the May Day parades.  It would be good to have an authoritative
answer, but netiquette dictates that I get your permission even though
you've posted to the list already.  E-mail me directly, please.

I'd also like to quote your post on the use of meat analogs in chili
dogs and update FAQ #11.  I know it seems weird to be preoccupied with
this stuff, but I think the only two subjects that have REALLY taken up
a lot of bandwidth are a) Is/isn't Sally a fox? (the pro-fox believers
are serious die-hards), and b) the origin of Tails' tails [FAQs #4 and
#1, respectively].

I've got no problem with that.  What I think might be a concern with
some of us on the list is...well, I remember a statement that was made
in the context of a documentary on Elvis Presley's film career.  Someone
was quoted as saying: "After 'Jailhouse Rock' they thought they could
put Elvis in ANYTHING and it would make money.  They were right."

THAT, I think, is the concern: not that you have a core audience and
you're sticking with it, but that the level of the writing might start
drifting downward to the lowest common denominator.  Glad to hear you're
working to stay creatively fresh.  Speaking of which:

I don't know when I first noticed Sonic comics for sale, but I can tell
you that the first issue I ever bought was #18, BECAUSE OF "In The Still
Of The Night"!  I was THAT impressed with your handling of the death of
Julayla.  It was excellent writing: nothing "happened" in the sense of
plot, but the story was very well written.  And I especially loved your
elegant solution to the problem posed in the old "Kung Fu" TV series!

Yet the best part of the story was the way it added depth to the
characters -- I've said as much in previous posts on this list, some
addressed to Paul Castiglia.  It made such an impression that I went so
far as to incorporate Julayla into one of my fanfic stories set in a
time when the freedom fighters were ten years old: "Capture The Flag."
But enough about me.

There have been examples of strong writing throughout the series:
"Wedding Bell Blues" saved the twist until the end, to good effect.
"That's The Spirit" worked well, though I thought Sally wouldn't be so
dismissive of Tails' insistance that Sonic was still alive--she seemed
more empathetic than that.  But then you have the two-parter "Growing
Pains" which started out with such promise, and which not a few of the
members of this list latched onto, only to turn into a train wreck in
the second half.  I don't know what you have planned for the next 18
months, but I know a lot of fans wouldn't be disappointed if you brought
back Fiona and had her joining the Knothole gang!

Just the usual $.02,

---Ahem----

As I was typing this article out, I was noticing that the majority of the
internet are now dressed in black, as it were.  They are currently in morning
over the fact that Satan's child, a.k.a. Bill Clinton, who may be defiling
the oval office with his presence but was never and will never be my
president, (Rush Limbaugh is, you damn fools!!!) has signed the
Telecomunications Bill that makes cybersmut a crime and demands Violence
Chips on TVs.  You might think that I'm joining in on this "party," because
some of my pages are black, expecially the ones with the big pictures of my
artwork on it.

They are *not* black for the above reason.  They are black so you can see the
pics better.  No other.

I find myself IN FAVOR of *somebody* controlling the availability of material
hazordous to minors on the Net (That's *smut* you dumb@$$!!), because I
believe that there is just too much Sexual Material crammed into their lives
all at once.  Whatever happening to having fun, just making friends, and
getting to *know* your net.lover before you go to the back seat of your
486DX2-66?  Surely Nodoby on the net will pass a law to outlaw *that*!!!  I
will discuss this further later on in American Kitsune.

I would like to assure to my little rest stop on the Information Superhighway
and the Telecomuniation Bill *will not in any way* affect this page.  I do
not allow such crap to even touch my page, and therefore do not have anything
for whoever's playing net.police raise a stink about.  The same goes for
rat.org, now that the hentai ('Perverts' to those who aren't in Anime)
department was removed, half a year before this Bill.  The same goes for the
remainer of the Sonic Pages.  We're not www.playboy.com here.  We're just a
bunch of guys and gals discussing a Video Game universe for Pete's Sake!  And
In a network the size of the entire cosmos, to boot!!  You think that anyone
outside our little world *cares*?  I don't.

The average Joe Cyberjock will not be affected by the Telecommunications bill
which is trying to keep NC-36 rated crap from people who don't need it in
their lives.  All this laments of censorship is just hysterical parinoia
brought on by pinko commie liberals with tiny minds who think primarily with
their penises.  They can have their little pics of doing dogs and naked ugly
performance artists with a bullwhip in their anus.  I just don't want them,
and the same goes for most of my fans!!!  That's all.  The Net is NOT dead!!
 Long live the Net!!!   And The FoxFire Studios will still be trucking down
the Information Superhighway, no matter *what* Exon will think about it.

Remember:  The only way to stop me is to kill me, and if I'm dead tomorrow,
Clinton did it.

I'd first like to say... Welcome to the Sonic Mailing List Ken!

I've enjoyed the Archie Sonic comic ever since I got copies of two (of 4)
Sonic miniseries issues from the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show a few
years back (I also saw parts of the SAT-AM cartoon before it officially
aired there too).  I'm pretty sure I have all the issues out so far (even
Sonic 1/4... that 8-page subset of Sonic Miniseries #0)

On Fri, 9 Feb 1996 Benny7dude@aol.com wrote:

I think a lot of people on this list didn't realize this... or sometimes
forget this fact.


I'm sorry to hear that the Sally Miniseries didn't do as well as hoped... 
I'd probably have avoided it too when I was younger (superficially, it
looked too much like a 'girl comic'... eeewww... coodies).  As far as
'finding' the comic.. I didn't have any problems here.  For some reason
the comic book shop I usually go to gets Sonic issues before anyone else
on this list (I got the Sonic vs. Knuckles 48 page special about a week
ago... excellent! ... almost as good as Sonic 25 (my favorite issue so
far) ) 

Too bad the 2-page Super Sonic vs Hyper Knuckles pinup drawing wasn't 
placed right in the center like it looked like it should have been...
Was that a mistake?

Also...  Is there any chance of getting Scot Shaw! to do some more drawing
for Sonic? 

  --  SUPER SPOILER ALERT  --

















Now THAT's an interesting twist... What's this with Sally and Knuckles
knowing each other... Is Archie trying to turn the Sonic/Sally/Geoffery
'love triangle' into a Sonic/Sally/Geoffery/Knuckles 'love tetrahedron'?

Is this thing about the power rings being a manifestation of power
crystals (or visa vera) one of those inconsistancies that Sega has
presented Archie with?  I thought Uncle Chuck was supposed to be the one
who invented the rings.  

I'm guessing it took a while for the 'Sonic Universe' to become more
self-consistant and people should take the earlier issue's plots with a
grain of salt.

And now, yet another apology.

Normally, I would directly reply to someone who had said something that

see an irrevelant flame war bouncing into your mailbox every morning.
Therefore, I request that all future replies to this message from any
other parties be directly addressed to David and I personally.

This message is not at all StH related.  You may stop reading here.

You certainly dislike Clinton, don't you?  While I also personally dislike
the man, I hope that you realize he has had very little to do with the
current state of the government.  After all, he *is* only a figurehead.
(I won't comment on Rush.)

Also, he had little choice but to sign the document.  If he would have
vetoed it, the Congress would have overriden it and made him look like
a supporter of "kiddie porn" (or whatever the ultraconservative lunatics
are crying that the Internet is filled with today).  If he would have
ignored it, he would have looked like a supporter of "kiddie porn".  Thus,
the only politically viable move he had was to sign the accursed thing.
That's life.

I am going, friends, to try to remain calm.

David, do you honestly mean that you want the United States government,
an organization that has so far f-ked up the economy of most of North
America and can barely keep order in its own capital; an organization
mostly made up of computer illiterate, old, white males; and an
organization with the ability to silence any irritating little schism
within its borders, controlling EXPRESSION on the Internet?!

In the name of whatever deity you worship, Gonterman, you're playing with
fire by supporting such lunacy.  Don't you realize that free speech, no
matter if it is offensive to you, is the most vital part of democracy?
The loss of it is the first step into a police state.  

Now, I agree that minors should be kept away from porn...by use of *local*
filters installed by (that's right) PARENTS.  You know, those people who
used to be able to control their children?  THEY should be the ones who
are responsible for what their children see, not a monolithic establishment
like the US government.  Honestly, if you can't control what your
children see, don't have them.

Take a look at the big picture, David.

The government will first take away the porno and the "offensive" materials
from the net, much to the glee of the Chirstian Coalition and other fringe
groups.  Then, perhaps they'll extend the law into the "dangerous" things
on the 'net; hacker stuff, cypherpunk pages, the HTMLized version of the
Jolly Roger, etc.  And after that, maybe a bit more of a stretch into
the realm of "cults".  Then, the "unpopular" and "weird" sites will come
under the thumb of Uncle Sam.  And that, friends, is when they start to
become obvious in their oppression, even to the layman...

Free speech, no matter what the message is, should be allowed to flourish
all over the world; especially in America.

Thank you, Mr. Bunker.  Insults from a flaming ultraconvervative neo-Nazi
dog, who thinks only with the peanut that happens to occupy the vacuous 
pocket between his ears, comes as a compliment to me, a mere pinko commie 
liberal with a tiny mind, who thinks primarily with my penis.

Name-calling: don't do it unless you want it back.

Clinton didn't do it, you plebian.  Clinton had to sign it in order to keep
from getting smacked with it during the election.  Congress and Senator
Exon actually *did* it.

Thanks for the kind words and understanding.  As you said, working on the
railroad results in many complaints as well.  I have to tell you, I took the
train for four years to college, and yes, there were many breakdowns and
problems.  In retrospect, however, the smooth, uneventful rides outnumbered
the negative ones.  I hope people think of our Sonic comics the same way.
 Yes, we're trying to please all age groups-- and that may sometimes put off
the older readers.  But at least there have been some good "older reader"
stories published-- and more to come!  Thanks again!

Best regards,

Paul Castiglia

This is the kind of thing that is appropriate ON your pages. You should have
made a page to explain this. 

This is obviously off topic, and you know it. Do it again, and you will be
kicked off. 

NOBODY should reply to this posting. If you feel like replying to this, 
write to me directly and not the list.

No smut is going to jump up on their screens. You have to actively search 
for it. OTOH, what is bad is censorship. Especially trying to censor an 
international medium. A net.lover is a completely different thing than a 
picture.

I don't care at all what people do in 
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.bestiality.hamsters.duct-tape, and noone 
should. It's their business, and on the net you mind you own business. If 
you drag your kids online, then you have to take responsibility for them.
I think I'll put up a page with the images from the perv directory, once 
I find them all, just for the Pete of it.

This is quite a fatal blow to freedom and the net. Most of the most-read 
groups on the net are in fact groups with either the word "sex" or 
"erotica" in them, and the most searched-for word in the Web search 
engines are "sex". It isn't their business what people do with their 
computers. Hopefully, the saying "Internet interprets censorship as 
damage and routes around it.". There are still many countries and servers 
from which you may post your pictures and stories, so this will only make 
the people it wants ti get to go underground or route around it.

I actually replied to him and Joseph D. about the actual topic.. and forgot
to mention the off-topic-ness it was for the Sonic list.  ...but that aside..

Didja see what he said? <smirk>

Rat dewd.. ya gotta understand that I'm a somewhat religious Romand
Catholic, registered republican conservative 23 year old... and I *HATE* the
CDA...
and this guy's talking as as if Rush Limbaugh is God and knows everything
and that the CDA is a step in the right direction.  OOOOOooooh God! :/

I haven't listened to Rush Limbaugh in ages 'cause he's changed a lot...
he's not the logical make-sense politic-news-talkperson that he used to be..
he's turned into Mr.Popular, an entertainer.  Oi!  Wotta place to spout out
almost nazi-like stuff.. the Sonic list. :P

uhh.. so how's your day been?  <smirk>

This whole CDA thing sounds like a Robotnik ploy to me; bad enough it's

This is the Sonic mailing list.

There is a Sonic PC game in development now; however, this list is NOT 
the correct place for discussions or queries with regard to the PC game.

If you would like to discuss the game, send these commands:
  subscribe mettle
  end
in the text area of a message to majordomo@lists.mv.net.  Do not use the 
Subject: line as majordomo will ignore it.

Z0rO, write to "mettle@bort.mv.net" :)  (and yes, we are looking for 
programmers.)

Oh yeah, I have a question for those that care: how come we rarely see 
the OTHER freedom fighters in the comix?  Just curious..

There is a whole mailing list for talk on that, so talk about the PC game 
is banned from this list.

If you want to join that list, write to majordomo@lists.mv.net and put 
this in the message body:

subscribe mettle


write to owner-mettle@lists.mv.net if you have any other questions.

     Well, I want to add my voice to the chorus of outrage other members on

Dear friends

KP: The writers don't have the luxury of being able to prolong the action like 
    you see in your average DC or Marvel comic where one story can take up to 
    half a year or more worth of issues. 

     Is there any way to change policy to allow writers that option if they
want it, like through a write-in campaign? 

KP: In fairness to the people at SEGA, they wanted to create a viable 
    environment where the public would be anticipating more PRINCESS SALLY
    products such as a her own video-game or line of t-shirts or whatever

     Princess Sally merchandise.  What a concept. :-) 
     Are any of these suggested tie-ins going to be actually developped.  I
hope so.

KP: The sad part was fan reaction was VERY positive, but poor distribution 
    resulted in poor sales. I'd still like to do another SALLY mini-series.

     If a gaffe in distribution caused the problem, maybe someone can be 
persuaded to give you a chance at a second series with more care taken over the
distribution.  That second series should succeed.

KP: Disney is many times bigger, granted, than Archie, but what both companies 
    are founded on is good, clean wholesome family fun.

     It's a wonder then that you were able to get the Love Triangle story
thread through then. :-)
     It's just seemed to me that the comic book had been pitched at too low a 
level in recent issues, with ideas like the Auntie Bodies.  I'd prefer that 
the comic book have a reality closer in line to the Saturday Morning Cartoon,
which was still popular with kids.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

Geoffrey has turned out to be quite popular with a number of readers, for
which I'm gratified. So has the "Love Triangle" thread, which will see
further development in upcoming issues. A bit of behind the scenes info here:
The Love Triangle thread would've been the focal point of a second PRINCESS
SALLY mini-series. Since that's not going to happen in the foreseeable
future, it's just being spread out over several issues of SONIC.

Which Freedom Fighters do you think you're not seeing enough of? Bunnie? Yep,
I agree there. You're gonna see more of her in upcoming issues. Antoine,
Rotor and Tails are featured practically every issue. The same can be said
for Sally. We've introduced Geoffrey of his Majesty's Secret Service, which
makes him a defacto Freedom Fighter. We've shown Dylan, Arlo, Penelope and
Hamlin as Freedom Fighters in training. If I'm missing something in your
inquiry, please be more specific.

No offense, (not YOU guys's fault, I blame Sega,) I HATE Antoine as a 
charachter.  I'd actually like to see LESS of him. ;)  (he's very 
annoying and doesn't provide that comic relief.  I think Rotor is a 
better comic releif, and he's usually not even funny!)  I'm partial to 
Tails and Sally myself.  :)

Ken, check this out, for it may be valid.  I was wondering: When STH 
first started out, it was VERY kiddie-based.  What I mean by that is 
there drawings were OK, the "puns" were nerdy, and the vocab was aimed 
towards our "younger generation".  NOW, I fully understand that.  
HOWEVER, recently, the vocabulary is expanding, the artwork, (thank God 
take this as a compliment! :)) is becomming awesome to say the least, and 
the puns aren't QUITE as bad, (they're still pretty bad.)  It's good to 
see you guys are getting so much better, but why?  I guess what I'm 
asking is did people get laid off because they were doing a crappy job, 
and better artists/etc. haulled in?  I haven't noticed TOO many changes.  
Maybe it's just me.  

PS-don't take the previous as a bash.  I guess I'm just a little kid with 
a bigger allowence & still buy all the STH stuff-yes, even princess sally 
mini-series, (and NO, I'm not gay!).  So, as you do KEEP up the good 
work, IMPROVE, IMPROVE, IMPROVE!  :)

       BTW-4 all that care, my web page is BROKEN and I can't fix it for 
a plethora of time.  (why?  my CPU is BROKEN that's why.)  Later!

Uh, not that I would know or anything, but I'd think the _least_ likely 
guys to buy a Princess Sally comic would be gay... :^)  (you haven't read 
much of alt.fan.furry, have you?  :^))

I know I have said this before.
I don't beleave that ARCHIE is limited to what they do on Sonic.
I know they said something like they can't do storys like Marvel or DC.
Hmmmmmm.  Explain why TMNT was great even better then the show.
Why can't they do the same for Sonic is it Sega or limited resoures.
I would really like to see the comic get closer to the show it was based from.
I mean if I was around 10 years old I'll think the story were weird.

Some have said Antoine is the way he is because of shock brought on by 
the war.  Fine, but enough is enough.  Our Vietnam veterans suffering 
from PTSD have their problems, but acting like Antoine does (or similar 
thereto) is quite exceptional for them.  He is so inept you'd think the 
other Freedom Fighters would, if nothing else, let him stay back in 
Knothole.  There's surely something he could do that even he can't screw 
up while the others are out on missions.  Remember when Sonic was willing 
to let the cannibal hyenas just keep Antoine?  The other FF's themselves 
consider him dead-weight.  Could his lack of a tail somehow be connected 
to his apparent lack of a brain?

It doesn't have to be this way, though.  I got 3 of the Teitelbaum books 
last year, and Antoine wasn't half the dolt he is in the cartoons and 
Archie comics.  Archie did let Antoine sort-of succeed in a mission when 
Tails left a power ring in M/Robotropolis.  Maybe it's time to build on 
that and let him mature slowly but surely over the next year or two, and 
one day he will look back and think, "Oh how could I, Antoine Zee Great, 
evair have been so... so stupide?".

And doesn't anyone find any of this a little bit offensive towards French 
people?
And yes, I would love to see Antione not be such a dork. He just annoys me.

The Good News: I have an idea as to how that can be accomplished.  I've
incorporated it in my story-to-end-all-stories, "Mobius Apocalypse"
[curentlly under construction].

The Bad News: it isn't pretty.

    Hello, all Sonic listers!
    My sig tells mostly about me, so I just have some questions.
    For one, I've been writing episodes for a while now, and just 
recently found out that there actually IS a place for Sonic fans on 
the net.

The questions are:

    1) How can I get my episdodes on the Web page with all the others?
    
    2) Do they have to be copyrighted???? (This has been bugging me 
for a while now.)

    Uh, oh, gotta go. NOW!!!!

Yup.. The 'maturity' of the comic has jumped around a bit... especially 
in the earlier issues (it seems to be geared for an older audience 
nowadays).  I've always attributed this to the Archie staff trying to 
figure out exactly WHO their audience is.  I've also attributed this 
to taking a while for the writers to figure out what to do with the 
characters. [ e.g. Ever notice how stiff everyone seemed in the earlier
episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation?  The writers and actors 
didn't have a good idea of who the cast was supposed to be until the 
third season ]

I've noticed quite a few changes... I was going to make a table which has
all the artists, editors, pencilers, etc. and which issues they did but 
never got around to it.  I'm pretty sure the top guy (Goldwater) has stayed
the same since Sonic Miniseries #0 but hasn't there been a few other
Editor changes?

I've never said you're gay... I just said you have cooties cuz you bought
a girl comic... nyeh nyeh nyeh.  [ just kidding... see my previous mail 
posted here to figure out where THAT comment came from ]

How about DULCY... I don't see much of her since she was first introduced.

Yes... Long ago I said I didn't care for Dulcy on the TV series due to
her annoying voice... Well, now that she's in a comic [and in fanfic 
stories], I can imagine her voice as not so annoying and I've gotten to 
like her much better.

I've thought Antoine's potential has been 'underused' at times... Some of
the last episodes of the Sat AM series were finally beginning to see his
potential (like when he was kidnapped and Snively tried to get info out of
him by torturing him with bad cooking) 

I know I can get that way when I see someone 'doing it wrong' while using
a word processor or other program which I'm familiar with.  "Ahhh!  You're
trying to line things up with spaces when you should be using tabs!  Ahhh!  
Why aren't you using paragraph styles?  Ahhh!  Why are you adding all of
your misspelled words to the spelling directory?  (things I've had to deal
with in my office... Ahhhh!)"

Dan Drazen said he's working on a story with Antoine being used in a 
positive way.  Long ago I said I couldn't think of any ideas for my
own Sonic stories... So far I have about 4 ideas floating around...
the most complete idea will have Antoine playing a very positive role
(it also presents my theory as to how power rings work).  [I think I've 
briefly described some of these ideas to someone on the list... Dan I

send them to me.  My address is rotor@primenet.com and I'll attempt to 
review and post them to the page.  Though sometimes it takes awile, since 
I'm usually a bit busy.

Putting a copyright notice at the beginning is always a good practice to 
get in the habit of.  Just put something similar to the stuff you see in 
the other stories at the top of yours.  And NEVER forget to give credit 
to the creators of the characters that aren't yours.

In the meantime, I look forward to reading them.

Actually, Antoine is not such a bad character. The way I see him, he's been
through a war, and he didn't like what he experienced. This has, in effect,
tempered him with a certain pragmatism. He recognizes a bad situation when he
sees one, and he knows his limitations. He also has a certain snobbishness to
certain, which is appropriate considering his French background. And before
anyone of French ancestry get on my back for such a stereotype, I've had more
than one person decry some of the negative traits of their fellow Frenchmen
or women, so they recognize it among themselves as well. When the right story
comes along, Antoine will get his moment to shine.

The thing to realize is the name of the book is SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, NOT "The
FREEDOM FIGHTERS" or SONIC THE HEDGEHOG & FRIENDS. While we try to give the
others characters room to grow, we can only do so much with the space we have
and we can't do it at Sonic's expense. That's why the mini-series and back-up
series.

The other thing to realize is that anybody who's reading this is already a
SONIC fan. We need you to make people aware the comics are every bit as good
as what you're getting from the other publishers. Most readers of straight
super-hero books, for instance, are surprised when they read a story in SONIC
that could very well have appeared in THE AVENGERS of JUSTICE LEAGUE, to name
a couple of titles. Our attitude is a good story is a good story, only in
this case we have cute, furry animals as our representatives for telling that
story.

Hey, over at American On-Line, Sally *was* not only in love with K, she also
shared a psionic link with him.  It was later rectified just before I got

My answer to Twan's delimina:  A "Tails of Mobius" Comic.  I would buy a
second comic with the minor characters, but I would understand the lack of
intrest in others.  It happened with TMNT when that comic was in its prime,
and you can imagine what happened with *any* Marvel Comic...

I hate to disappoint anyone, but as will be shown in an upcoming issue (and I
should know, 'cause I just wrote it), Knuckles did NOT have any type of
romantic relationship with Sally whatsoever. I'm not sure where Mike
Gallagher got the inspiration for this one, but I had to pick up the ball and
cover this base pronto on the off-chance we get to do the KNUCKLES series on
a regular basis. Once you read the mini-series, you'll understand why Mike K
 and I are sticklers where KNUCKLES is concerned.

The following stories are now available on my web page:

By Joseph DeLaCroix:	Thirst
			Triky situations
By Dan Drazen:		A Matter of Trust


NOTES:  Coming soon: The stories page is becoming crowded, and I intend 
to fix that.  Each author who currently has a story posted will have 
their stories move to individual pages so that each author has a page for 
their stories.  Note to authors.  If you've got a graphic of either 
yourself or your sonic character, Email it to me and I'll post it on your 
stories page along with your stories.  Other than that, just keep sending 
me your stories and I'll keep trying to post them. :)

Dear Ken:

Hope all is well with you.  I just wanted to address a topic which you have
been discussing with the Sonic fans here on the mailing list.  That topic is
the limitation of space in our comics.  As was pointed out, there isn't a
precedent here at Archie to have stories drag on for more than four issues at
a time or so (the "Knuckles" 2-pagers excepted of course-- thanks for
explaining that situation to everyone-- I would have myself if I was aware of
how confused everyone was over it!).  Unfortunately, due to market
conditions, this will probably remain the case.  Readers are leaving such
popular comics as Spider-Man, Bat-Man, X-Men, Superman etc. IN DROVES for
just that reason (and our research has shown that was one of the reasons our
Turtles comic readership dropped as well).  The #1 feedback I get from
retailers who have polled their customers is that they want either
self-contained, one issue stories or storie arcs of only a few issues. The
bosses here at Archie have to be able to justify the expense of printing
these comics, as you know, which means there has to be profits.  Extending
stories to last over several issues when the market is clearly not supporting
such things would not be a wise move, as I'm sure you'll understand.  Now, if
the mailing list here comprised 90% of our readership instead of the other
way around, perhaps things will be different.  In the meantime, as always,
you know I (and many of the fans here) applaud your efforts to provide a
specific continuity and mythology to these characters!

Take care,

Paul

I'd been reading some of the 2099 series comics for a while but eventually
'gave up' on them... not necessarily because of long stories but because
of excessive use of plots interconnected among several different comics..
Too many 'plot crossovers'. [I doubt this is the 'official' use of the term
'crossover' but that's how I'm defining it here]
  
Occasional crossovers can be interesting at time however Marvel has
decided to make practically EVERYTHING a crossover.  (Also.. all the 2099
books seem to have this underlying DOOM 2099 thing which is really getting 
dumb). 

Other unrelated comments:

At first I was suprised that the general plots for Archie's SONIC stories
are planned out so far in advance (especially the one involving Knuckles /
Archimedes / 'The Watcher' [my term for the Weird-guy-in-cloak-in-the-room-
with-all-the-tv-monitors] )

When was this whole concept first conceived (The first hint of it 
appears to be in that 'Fire Drill' story... Sonic & Kuckles 48-page
special I think)?

Has the reader been given visual 'hints' as to what the heck is going
on?  [ e.g. at one time 'The Watcher' says Knuckles has missed clues
right under his nose... but in that panel we see an old sign with
some words which don't seem to make much sense ]

(No need to comment on this if it'll give too much of the story away)

    - -

Wait a sec... wasn't Mighty captured?  What's he doing in the 48 page
Sonic VS Knuckles special.

    - -

A while back people mentioned that Sonic (The Sat-AM series) was now on 
the USA Cartoon Express on Sunday (9am Central?) but nobody mentioned 
that Sonic (The daily series which everyone loves to hate) is also on
the USA network weekdays at 6:30am Central.

Now that we finally get cable I can finally get to see that show as well.

    - -

  Best inside joke which I havn't seen yet:

  Sonic (covering up Scratch's eyes from behind) --  "Guess who!"
  Scratch -- "Umm... That Urkle kid?"

Well the storys don't have to be as long as a MARVEL or DC story.
Just please improve.  The comic could at lest run along the lines of the Sat
show.  Exaple through each epsoide was a different story there where all related
to the efects of the previous story and endded up at Doomsday.

Hello Everybody!

     I didn't post very often because of the $203 phone bill I got
from calling AOL (KILL THEM, PLEASE!), but I sent a request for an
unlimited E-mail service (DC's CapAccess <just in case you want it,
E-mail me>), and got it!

     Now, Sonic stuff (I bet previous stuff was NOT interesting):

I am currently working on some projects relating StH and this list.
A story (that one is incredibly slow. I think I know how Archie
feels), a picture, a statue of Sonic and Sally back-to-back looking
kind of mean (that one has a quote under it. I got the idea from
the StH game name. The quote is "Mettle is power, Metal is death"),
and the last one is a Sonic the Hedgehog "Blue" (yellow) Pages.
That last one will have the E-mail addresses of all the people who
called in 1996 (and maybe before that). That thing has graphics, a
small list info file, and a "Buttons Hall of Fame" page. That page
will have the names of people who wrote stories (I will ESPECIALLY
look that Dan's name is in place :') ), who run lists, and who just
need to be recognized. That file (Yes, just one 'Neobook' file
<Isn't there someone from Neosoft here>) is just a reference for
people with bad memories (such as myself), and it is NOT
copyrighted (details within). It should be finished some time soon
(I hope).

Now for some comics:
     When you guys have been talking about issue #33, I just got
issue #32. I am not blaming Archie, but the delivery around here
is extremely bad!
     Ancient history -> I don't know if anyone noticed (no one
posted, anyway), but in Spandize's (spelling?) cover art of issue
#31 is a small picture, hidden in the upper left corner in the
mountains. The picture is a head of a person (sort of like
japanimation) with a fist extended forward. This picture does NOT
look like a coincidence. Well, at least it not like what Disney is
doing with their cartoon classics (word SEX in "Lion King". Want
more? Too bad).

Stories:
     There seems to be a Star Trek "craze" going on here. What?
Run out of Freedom Fighter ideas? (no offence intended). Someone
(Drazen?) posted about "furry" being a slur in his story. I thought
that most of the Mobius inhabitants WERE "furry's."

Mail To Archie:
     Archie guys said that they have enough story suggestions to
last them 1.5 years. Is it possible to create a sort of
"competition", where people send in a lot of stories, and the best
ones are picked (this would definitely improve the plots), or would
that just create mayhem, and put the entire section of Archie under
6 feet of 1 paragraph :') suggestions? Also, why can't Archie use
"To be continued"'s? (just curious)
  P.S. I am glad to see most of Archie's Sonic division on this
list (and in my "Blue" pages)

And finally, a question off topic:
     Has anyone heard of the writer Tuve Janson? He published a
couple of books somewhere in Europe. All of those books are about
a small group of animals that have some interesting adventures. I
have one of his books, titled "The Magician's Hat". If you have any
info on this author, please reply to my E-mail. Please note:
     I HAVE A NEW E-MAIL ADDRESS!

The "SEX" claim is merely an unsubstantiated rumor, but that's another 
issue that I won't go into on the list.

I don't think a few story ideas constitutes a "craze", but let's just see 
how the stories turn out.

They are.  I believe he meant that 'furry' is used as a slur by the 
humanoids in the Federation/Starfleet.

You're too kind.

Blame Archie's distributor, which Ken Penders cites as the reason for
the failure of the Princess Sally miniseries.

WHOA!!  Good eye!  I missed it myself.  You're right; very Japanese
style, almost like a cross between Sonic and Astroboy (hey, if you're
going to mention a robot in the same breath as Sonic--or any other
Mobian--the robot should be a Good Guy(TM)).

As someone pointed out in their post, the slur was used particularly in
Starfleet Academy.  If memory serves, someone else mentioned working on
a crossover story and I admitted the idea had crossed my mind, so I
posted the synopsis.  Don't expect to see it any time soon; I've got
plenty to do in Real Life(TM).  In fact, as soon as I finish going
through my e-mail, I have to work on a term paper about the book of
Ecclesiastes.

According to Ken Penders' recent posts, it doesn't look like they're
accepting submissions at this time.  Also, KP says that there seems to
be a limit of tolerance with continuing stories with the core comic
readership out there (and that may be one reason why so many titles are
dying).  So they make do with the pages allotted them each month.  I
wouldn't mind continuing stories, either, but there seems to be a
three-issue limit.

I saw this in the grocery store last night, and for $5 I figured it was 
worth having (they only had two left, and if anybody wants them bad enough 
to pay me $10 for them (includes shipping) I'll pick them up for them).

Basically it's like a Where's Waldo book except it uses the Sonic characters 
(i.e., scenes of many characters doing many things, and you're supposed to 
find certain objects and/or people in them).  

Penciled by Art Mawhinney, Inked by Dan Burr and Brian Thomas (how did they 
_do_ all that, and how long did it take?).  Illustration Script Developers:

The rest of this message contains spoilers, so here's a form feed for you:

The inside front cover has nice pics of the following characters:
Sonic, Tails (though the kind of babyish version that I don't really like),
Sally, Antoine, Bunnie (yay!!!  Though about the best pic of her in the 
whole book), Rotor, Snively, Swat-bot, and Dr. Robotnik (oddly enough, the 
daily version, not the Sat. AM one - maybe they figured the kiddies wouldn't
recognize him otherwise...)

Each page has a follow-the-blur sequence of Sonic doing various things, 
which is kind of neat.

Here are some misc. comments on the more interesting things on the 
various pages:

Green hill: Sonic saving Sally.

Marble zone: some skunks blasting something off-page (was the original art
bigger?) with aerosol cans; Bunnie trying on jewels from a treasure chest 
while being menaced by skeletons.

Aquatic zone: SS Minnow life preserver, Ariel the mermaid (not worried 
about being sued by Disney?  :^)), Bunnie in a submersible vehicle.

Robotropolis: Just-married Swat-bots???, the robot dog lifting his leg 
against a "curb your dog" sign.

South island: some furries playing that fish game with sticks

Knothole: skunk scouts (!), Sonic giving his autograph.

Icecap zone: what is Bunnie holding?

Veg-o-fortress (?): "dangerous curves" indeed :^)

Launch base: Hanger 18: "There's nothing in here.  Really."  But I thought 
the "Shuttle Experiment DOA 86" was a bit in bad taste...

All in all, a nice book for furrie/Sonic fans for $5...

I see Antoine as a foil for Sonic.  Sonic is cool; Antoine is the epitomy of
uncool. This works to great advantage in the SatAM show, but isn't as effective
in solo stories in the Archie comic series.

Rotor is an unsung hero of the Freedom Fighters.  It's clear that what he does
is essential to their missions, but since he isn't always risking his hide like
Sonic, his role doesn't seem as exciting.  "Tundra Road" goes a long way towards
changing this though.

Who isn't?  ;-)

A few comments on recent Sonic comic issues: 

[ SPOILERS ]



#31 - I too noticed the figure in the rocks on the cover, as Dmitry points out.
At first I thought it was a mountain spirit, but now it's beginning to make
sense in the context of the "Lost...and Found!" and succeeding Knuckles stories.

#32 - It seems odd that Mobie is more anthropoid than ursine, despite being
called a bear.  I also note that Uncle Chuck is drawn using an older hedgehog
design (from Scott Shaw!), while Sonic has become more streamlined.  Does this
mean that Sonic is wearing a different spine-style now?  :-)

#33 - I just _love_ the cover!  It just grows on you, it looks like it's been
drawn from life. :-)  I really appreciate the amount of detail Spaz puts into
his backgrounds.  As for the story "Let's Get small!", I enjoyed it.  Despite
what some others may say, Manak's artwork appeals to me.  (Hmm, it would be
funny to see Alf in a Manak-drawn story, now that he's making a small comeback.)
While the setting isn't entirely original ("Fantastic Voyage", and even "Honey,
I Shrunk the Hedgehog" from the weekday Sonic cartoon were set in micro-worlds),
and there wasn't much of a plot, the puns more than made up for it by the end.
:-)  The other freedom fighters were just cured too easily for me, but it was
fun to see Tails in drag.  I didn't think that "Froggy Boy" was an appropriate
insult for Sonic to be hurling (although quite in character for him); perhaps
something along the lines of "Frog in ones throat" would have been better.

I also noticed in the ad for SuperSonic vs. HyperKnuckles (2nd last page), 
that "YIELDS" is in neither Sonic's nor Knuckles' vocabulary.  I guess we
can rib Mike Gallagher about it. :-)

One comment about "Sonic Shot" -- Ken Penders' Tails looks a bit off.  Maybe
it's the neck, or the snout, but it just doesn't look like Tails to me.  Or
is this an older Tails we're beginning to see now?  :-)

SuperSonic vs. HyperKnuckles - as has been already mentioned on the list,
the pin-up poster was a couple of pages off-center.  Maybe the two Archie
ads were inserted after the page layout for "Crash of the Titans" had been
done?  Art Mawhinney is to be commended for his pencilling on this one.
I liked the cameo appearance of Orbinaut - Swatbots get oh so tiresome.
The "legal department" line was hilarious, too.  (At least to us on the 
Sonic list here, where it was coincidentally(?) a double entendre.)

"Fathers and Sons", like most of the Knuckles stories I've read, has him 
musing quietly to himself all the way through.  This really builds mood.
Interesting to see that Knuckle's dad has dreads too.

Well, that's enough rambling for today...

Anyone out there see yesterday's (Feb 17) episode of "C-Bear and Jamal"
on Fox?  (I know, this starts out off-topic, but it gets better).

In the story, Jamal turns 10 and suddenly starts thinking he can get
through the day without C-Bear.  Throughout the ep, I couldn't help but
think of Tails during "Growing Pains" and "Southern Crossover."  

By the end of the ep, however, the real reason for Jamal's wanting to
grow up comes out: despite the fact that his family, his homies and
C-Bear all tell him they'll be there for him, he remembers that his Mom
said the same thing but "she left me and went to Heaven."  C-Bear
assures Jamal that there'll always be people who'll be there for him
"because love never dies."  Which confirms my belief that the "C" in
C-Bear stands for Care and we're dealing with a Care Bear for the 90s,
but anyway....

WHY couldn't Gallagher have built toward such a line in Southern
Crossover?  As it stands, Tails about-face on how he feels about the
Knothole gang is totally unmotivated.  This is how it should have been
done.  But you've probably heard this from me before.

The KNUCKLES stories have been something of a departure from how we handle
SONIC. For one thing, SEGA has been VERY receptive to the back story we're
creating for him. As you will see, it's somewhat more dark and serious than
anything you've yet seen in the SONIC stories. FATHERS & SONS, if anything,
is more in the tone of the upcoming mini-series than anything that has come
before. The key difference is that the mini-series has a LOT more action. The
interesting aspect is how the stories developed. Initially, I came up with
the concept of KNUCKLES undergoing some sort of training period/ascension
rite to show how he became Guardian of the Floating Island. Archimedes was
created to play a specific role in that development. As initially presented,
KNUCKLES was TOO much of a loner, and he needed someone to play off of. When
the mini-series was proposed later, more was called for and we had to rethink
a number of items in order to really make this special. For instance, we were
told to lay the groundwork in a back-up sequence for three issues leading
into the mini-series, much like we had done previously for PRINCESS SALLY.
After we had completed those 3 eight page segments and the 1st issue of
KNUCKLES, we had received word Scott wanted another KNUCKLES story for the SS
VS HK SPECIAL #1. This, in turn, led to the development of FATHERS & SONS,
essentially a last minute decision on my part and Mike's to feature a crucial
development that will be an important part to KNUCKLES during the mini-series
and beyond. You, the reader, will be required to fill in some blanks until we
fill them in for you. (This is called a set-up. If sales are comparable to
SONIC'S, a KNUCKLES series shouldn't be long in coming. And, boy, is there a
lot of stories to tell you.)

One thing for those who try to keep track of continuity in the SONIC
UNIVERSE. We have tried to consider what was being done in other books and
especially in the cartoons. However, we never had access to everything that
was going on regarding the animated series unless the people at SEGA informed
us. However, because of dealines and the approval process, it just wasn't
possible to be as consistent as we'd like. Consequently, when the cartoon
went off the air, it freed the status quo up a lot in order of what we could
and couldn't do. Also, SEGA seems to have a better grasp of what they do and
don't want to do with the characters. For example, originally, KNUCKLES was
the only echidna and the last of his kind. And now........but that would be
telling, and you'll just have to wait and see.

Dear Michael,

If you give me an address, as one of the writers of Archie's SONIC THE
HEDGEHOG comic book series, I'd be happy to send you a couple of issues your
way. I'll even personalize the autograph if you like. Take care.

I have consider writing a story about this idea of Tails having growing pains.
Here's a short pice of what I thought up.
Note I don't name anybody parts that might be offenceive.

Tails ran behind a bush and hid, he was so embaresed.  Bunnie cault him.
"Tails?"  Bunnie said as she walked up to the bush.  "Go away."
Bunnie wanted to say something but desided to just let him calm down.
"OK I'll go now."  She said and walked away.

Tails was angery at him self.  He looked down.  "This is your fault."
Why did he start, it all started when he took that bath last week.  Cleaning
him self using soap and when he went to clean it...  Tales grumbled at the
thought why did it feel so good and why did he try it again behind the bush.
Bunnie saw him aaaaahhh now what.  Can he ever face her again.  What would
she think.

Don't worry, I'm sure you managed to offend somebody. :) 

I like the idea, because, as I've said in the past, I enjoy the stories
which have serious themes and am not offended by such things. I look forward
to reading it, if you decide to go ahead with it.

Paulie,

I was talking about EMOTIONAL growth, about maturity, about not looking
at the world in quite the same way as before, about letting go of some
aspects of childhood in their proper time.  It's a process that involves
the soul rather than any particular bodily organ.

I know I'm not going to change anything and that this was probably just
a troll -- but I wanted to get it on the record.

Old news to you guys, but how often I forget....

what year is it?  In Mobius, I mean....

you see, I'm trying to actually get around & update my web page, and I need
to know the year for something. =20

Isn't it like 2053?  I'm probably off... well, a date would be cool.  Thanx.

It's a 5.8 megs big zipped, unzips to over 10 megs.

It's converted from the Sonic CD. It just shows him running around, then
jumping onto a big chain. The music sounds like it must be called "Sonic
Boom" since they say it over and over. 
And it's actually converted, so there is no loss of quality.

Happens to the best of us.

The show is set in the Mobian year 3535.  By point of reference,
Robotnik took over in the year 3224.  Source: "Blast To The Past, Part
1".

It never hurts to help (wait, that's another show....)

Ain't it always like this?  You make one story of a kid going through 
puberty, and *everybody* wants in on the act.

You know how *I* stand on this:  Take *extreme* care with topics such as 
this.

however, i do hope that tails keeps his virginity for quite a while.  
He's got more important stuff on his mind; like finding that first-round 
Fatality in KI2....

There's a clue in "Blast to the Past-Part 1".  In that episode, Sonic and 
Sally go back to the year Robotnik took over (3224, I believe).  Based on 
various discussions here on the list, Robotnik has been Mobius' tyrant for 
about 11 years now.  So, by that logic, the year is now 3224 + 11= 3235 on 
Mobius (in the Sat. AM cartoon).  The year given in "Blast to the Past" may 
NOT BE 3224, however.  I'm writing this message strictly from memory.

	Whoever was posting those scans of the TV show, there's one 
character whom you left out, and I would like to see. Tails.

just for the record, I still didn't get issue #33, or anything higher 
than #32.

Oh you mean me.
Yes I have been busy.  I will send the Tails pictures shortly.  I don't have
that much since he was mostly in the back ground in the show.

If you can't get the comic's order them and ask for the back issues you missed.
I dought you missed much since the comic is starving for a good story.

I have also heard that there is a chance that Issue #50 will be there last one.
If this is so it's there fault for messing up on the story line not the readers.

Ken Penders has been lamenting the distribution of Sonic, especially the
Princess Sally series.  With reason, apparently.

You may have misunderstood Ken when he posted that Archie has PLANNED up
through issue #50 -- possibly as a way of discouraging submissions, I
don't know.  If you don't mind waiting possibly two years (!) to see
your story in print, ay so in the cover letter to your submission if
it's weighing that heavily on you.  He never said that the series would
STOP at #50; only that they've laid out which stories will run in which

Where on earth did anyone get the idea that SONIC issue #50 is the last
issue? In previous posts, I've said we pretty much have all the scripts in
development up to issue #50, with some idea where we're headed after that. As
for not missing much, you better start paying attention, because a lot is
happening in upcoming issues. Issue#34 finally kicks into high gear the
KNUCKLES story everyone's been waiting for, and Uncle Chuck is back in the
lead SONIC story. And, oh yeah, KING ACORN is coming soon. Lots more, too,
but I don't want to spoil the surprises.

Dan,

Thanks for clarifying the matter regarding SONIC'S last issue, which
hopefully won't be for a long time to come. As for discouraging submissions,
that I would never do. I was only trying to point out that anyone wishing to
do so is going to be fighting an uphill battle, that if they had the patience
and were prepared for the very real possibility of having to rewrite their
story to accomodate events that have already transpired in the Archie series,
that if they could work within those conditions then they might have a
chance, albeit a VERY SLIM one, but a chance nevertheless. It also helps when
the person submitting has had some previous experience selling stories to
publishers, especially other comic book publishers. 

I can already hear people asking how can they make a sale when no one is
giving them a chance. It's a Catch-22 situation, I admit, but if one is
resourceful and one is good, there's always an opportunity. You also have to
remember how many other people would love to write or draw a SONIC story, or
ARCHIE or X-MEN or BATMAN or STAR TREK. The odds of your story being used
when established professionals express interest in these assignments make the
deck even harder stacked against you. Right now, the industry is going
through some upheavel and people who weren't available before are now
scrambling for work. So keep these considerations in mind when submitting to
an editor, okay? If you get shot down, chances are very good it wasn't
anything personal. He or she just decided to go with a known commodity.

I got Issue #34 at my local comic shop yesterday... The Knuckles story 
is definitly on a roll now.  I thought the main sonic story started strong
but ended a bit too quickly.

It feels like a long time since we had SonicGrams with actual letters in
it.  I'm glad to see its back  [ More news ... Watch for a Bunny Rabbot
solo story... Issue #37 if I remember? ]

We'll also get to learn more about power rings in issue #35... I wonder
how close Archie's explanation of power rings is to mine (something I
STILL have to incorporate into a story).

	Someone asked what year it was. I had figured this out a few months ago 
for my stories and RPG.
	-Sally and Sonic were born in 3219
	-Antoine was born in 3217
	-The attack on the palace was in 3224
	-The destruction of the Doomsday project was 3235

	I figured this out using Blast to the Past and the comics. 

	Thanks,
		Nomad

	PS. Anyone have anything to say about my RPG? :)

Hello everybody!
     Whoever is making those .avi files, would you be able to scan
in the beginning of the episode "Sonic Boom" (it's the part with
the robot <I call this type "Scout-Bot"> going toward it's post).
I think that that part is very Cool.

>From what i have heard Archie say, I am very impatient to get my
hands on all of those cool stories that are coming up.

(My story is almost at a halt, the "Blue Pages" are getting
revised, and my first picture of Sonic and Sally (no they are not
at it you perverts) is supposed to be scanning by my friend, but I
haven't heard of it for a while. The only way I can upload these
files to my favorite page(rat.org) is to e-mail them to the owner
(Ratman?). Is this OK?)

BTW - does the roboticiser do the following, or is it less brutal?:

It is designed to be used with sedatives or under sleep. It sends
tiny robots into your body (nanites) that tear off every single
cell in your body, and replace it with a synthetic replica, except
for the cells in your brain, liver, kidneys, and some parts of your
lungs. These synthetic cells contain a stored DNA code that's used
to repair the body, and keep the backup of the original state of
the body. The surviving organs are penetrated with wires,
microchips, and tiny motors. The majority on nanites is stored in
"sleep" mode throughout your body, and can be activated at any time
(Bunny's failed derobotization). Due to the scale of this surgical
procedure, you will feel it very well. For the first couple of
seconds you will be in terrible pain, then you will go into
temporary shock, and finally, you will faint from the intensity of
the nerve signals (pain) sent to your brain. The last three steps
could be avoided by putting the patient to sleep, of under similar
situations.Once the process is complete, the nanites stored in your
body can be restarted in small colonies  throughout your body. Such
colony could be used to control brain functions, thus the
programming and loss of will power. The only way this process can
be fully reversed is by first converting your body to it's original
form through the use of nanites and DNA codes in the cells, and
then, the complete elimination of all nanites in your body. The
elimination of nanites is a very difficult process due to their
scale, their position, and their numbers.

(Doesn't this just BEG to be included in the FAQ? This was based on
the most popular ideas, with the holes filled in by the show, and
by me. I made sure that all of the holes were covered.)

     Hello All!
         I was thinking of the adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (The one
without Princess Sally) and I thought: Just WHAT is Grounder? I saw he was
supposed to be Scratch's twin, but Scratch messed it up. Every 'bot I saw on
the show and the comic are recognizable as to which animal they are. Except
Grounder. Is he some kind of mutated chicken? A household appliance? A
Paperweight? A fall-apart toy? Anyone know? But he's even weirder when his
parts are thrown about. Some quotes:
 
                  (Gets hit by cannonball)
               GROUNDER: I put my head back on for this?
               SCRATCH: Shut Up! At least you're supposed to be detachable!
                                                                            
                            But we can all agree he is stupid.
             SCRATCH: Maybe we could ask Dr. Robotnik for- a salary!
             GROUNDER: Not me! I'd rather ask to be paid every week!

                       Right.
Later,
                                                                        Ian

Grounder is a Burrobot. Unlike most of the others, he doesn't seem to be
based on any animal. He is a direct carry-over from the original Sonic the
Hedgehog video game.

As for Grounder being stupid, the ones in the game aren't very bright
either. :-)

A few years ago a StH fanfic story was posted to the newsgroup
alt.famn.furry (it wasn't well received, but anyway) with the above
title.  During a conversation at OzCon5 (with someone who also
believes Sally is a Weasel..we're everywhere :) I was reminded of
the posts, and so I'd like to read it again.  Did anyone here
archive the story, or at at least the author's email address?

What does the S. S. S. S. S. Squad stand for?
           Is Robotnik robotic?
           Every 'bot shown in the comic and cartoon are from the games
except Scratch.          What game is he from?

No, I don't think so, at least in Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Looks
just like his mother, in fact. :-) 

In Sega's original comic (long before number 1/4th from Archie), Robonik was
turned into his current condition when an experiment went wrong. It also
explained how Sonic got to be blue. The Archie series and the television
shows have different origins, since in those Sonic comes form a line of
equally blue ancestors.

No, there are have been many robots on the series which did not have origins
in the game. Breezy, the robot hedgehogette, has no game origin I know of.
Nor does Robotnic's robot son. 
As for Scratch, he actually looks a lot like one of the robotic chickens
from Greenhill Zone of Sonic the Hedgehog. That is, he looks like one that
someone grabbed by both ends and stretched a lot!

His arm is. And I think his skeleton is too (I think that the roboticiser 
converts your internal suport first <I.E your bones>. How else can you 
carry around at the very least 7 kilogram arm with such ease?)

Scratch looks very much like cluck in Sonic 2 Sky Fortress zone. (the one 
that shoots eggs at you.)

Dmitry:

Try thinking this through a bit more! ( ;-)  <-- indication of irony)

I've never been strong on the robobiotic/nanite scenario myself.
Because I'm something of a layman when it comes to the life sciences,
I've always worked under the model of a host/parasite relationship
between the robotic components (which attach to, work with, and
override the biological ones) and the roboticized body.

But that's just me.

Whoa!  The sysop here at the college doesn't allow access to ANY alt.fan

    Hi again! 
         Thanks to everyone who responded. The mail cascaded in! And the
contents were fabulous! I have a point.
Does anyone notice now that USA now has the Adv. of Sonic the Hedgehog,
they've been cutting out vital peices of humor? Some examples:

          - In "Road Hog", when the biker opens his mouth, an anvil falls
in. That's              been edited out.
        
          - In the one with Breezy as the main guest, when the dragon puts
his foot in              the water, alligators cascade it. Cut out.
          
          - When Scratch and Grounder cook Robotnik pancakes, the mad doctor
cooks fried             chicken brains on a Burrobot Oven. Cut Out. 
 
         Maybe the show should have stayed with Fox. Does anyone else see this? 
          
                                                                          Later,
                                                                         Ian

It is an unfortunate fact that just about anything USA shows has been cut
up, mainly to allow then squeeze in a few extra commericals. You also have
that silly USA icon you have to put up with. I would have preferred it to
have stayed on Fox myself. I don't think Fox ever gave the show much of a
chance, at least not here, since the latest they ever showed it was 6 am. :-(

A correspondent from my mini-list beat me to the main comment on the art:

Agreed - I just now noticed her last appearance on page 16 - yow!

>And Bunnie's black costume is pretty trick..although I don't

I think that whole black outfit thing is more for show than any practical 
camouflage.  And I see they're continuing to imply her entire lower half is 
robotic, but I'll let the .fandomers hash that out...

Nice Pogo reference on Page 9 (and Jay Ward too?  :^))

Good thing Rotor learned his lesson from Sally's roboticization and 
attached the Neuro-Overrider (TM, R) a bit more securely this time...

Now for the Knuckles story:

Is it just me, or did Echidnapolis as shown on page 2 look like scenes 
from pre-explosion Krypton?  :^)  And presumably future stories will show 
how and why they dumped their city for the more primitive look of the 
island today...

More office humor for Dan to flame, er comment on...  But I see Scott (or 
whoever answers the letters) dodged Roby Brown's question about what they 
do with all the letters - Scott in his "column" did say he read them all, 
but the question is does he file or toss them afterwards?

Not sure what to say about this one; I guess to sum it up, it tried to be 
everything to everybody, but I don't know how well it worked:

1.  Action stuff: Knuckles and Sonic fighting - didn't do much for me, but 
    maybe the 8-12 year-olds will like it...

2.  Fanboy stuff: Mawhinney/Koslowski - need I say more?  :^)  
    Though Sally only, no Bunnie...

3.  Funny stuff: "four to one they're in a fight by page six!", 
    "Get my agent on the phone!"  I laughed, but I hope we don't see too 
    much more Fourth Wall humor in the future - it's distracting...

4.  Character development: Sonic and Knuckles have a past???  
    Inquiring minds want to know more :^)

5.  Sega stuff: the story depends on the discovery of "an unknown [game] 
    zone"; I've never quite figured how they fit into Mobian geology, etc. 
    so I just tolerate them as something mandated by Sega and shoehorned into 
    the story...

Continuity glitch:  I thought the lake that generated power rings was near 
Knothole, not Robotropolis???

I don't have much to say about the Knuckles solo story - I never really 
cared much for him as a character, thus couldn't really get into it.

Super Sonic V. Hyper Knuckles Special #1 [no date]
"Crash Of The Titans"
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Art Mawhinney
OK, kids, let's sing the theme song!
     They fight 
     And bite
     They fight and bite and fight
     Bite bite bite
     Fight fight fight
     The Itchy and Scratchy...oops...
     The Sonic and Knuckles Show!
What can you say about a story where the basic plot can be summed
up as: "Sonic and Knuckles try to beat each other up; after
finding a hidden level, they warp into Super Sonic and Hyper
Knuckles...and try to beat each other up"?  What can you say
about a story that features no less than TEN editorial box
comments by Scott Fulop?  My term paper should have as many
footnotes!  What can you say about a story like that?  Quite a
bit, actually.
     Sonic intercepts Knuckles just as the latter is approaching
an abandoned pond in sight of Robotropolis.  This pretty much
signals the beginning of round 1, though Sally shows up a short
time later once a tree gets uprooted in the fight: "When the
landscape starts to suffer, I step in."  Detectng radiation
reading using Nicole, Sally peers into the hole left by the
uprooted tree.  It's a classic missed opportunity for Sonic and
Knuckles, for they're so busy glaring at each other that they
don't seem to realize that they're in the perfect position to get
an eyeful of Acorn booty.  "Don't be shy, boys!  Take a look down
here!"  Indeed!
     I've voiced my opinion about Gallagher's jokey scripts in
the past; this time around, he largely keeps it in check.  He
also gives Sally an amazing aside totally out of left field which
I will NOT spoil.  The curious can read it on page 13.  Gallagher
may specialize in screwball gag writing, but apparently he can
throw a mean curve when he has to.
     Once in the zone, Sonic and Knuckles each collect enough
trinkets to power up and resume their fight.  In order to bring
this to an end, the two buttheads butt heads with sufficient
force that the zone collapses ("I felt a great disturbance in the
Force, Luke!").  Sonic comes to as Sally provides about a page of
exposition.  She also gives Sonic a ride home on a "sky-cycle"
though Scott's editorial box neatly conceals the view of Sonic's
hands around Sally's waist -- party pooper!  (Though from what I
can see of the placement of Sonic's left hand, it's either just
gesturing or else was drawn wrong and the box serves the purpose
of an artistic fig leaf.  Sonic's left hand should have been
obscured by Sally's back instead of blocking her right side.  I
know, I know: everybody's an art critic!).  Knuckles has to
settle for a spare Chaos Emerald as a consolation prize.
     The story, though minimal, is better than expected.  Perhaps
Gallagher needed Mawhinney's brilliant (as usual) art as a
steadying influence.  Some bad jokes that strain the fourth wall
(particularly Robotnik's cameo role), and Sonic and Knuckles seem
at times like they're trying to talk each other to death, but a
good combination on the whole.
     "Fathers and Sons"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders; Art: Ken Penders
     The story begins with a younger Knuckles being given a tour
of the island by his father, who sports a short beard and whose
white belted jacket means either that he and Luke Skywalker buy
their clothes from the same store, or else he operates a dojo on
the side.  Turns out, in mid-tour, we learn we're in mid-
flashback.  The words Knuckles heard his father use have been
quoted at him by Archimedes.  After another flashback concerning
Knuckles' problem-solving strategy (when in doubt, punch it out),
we learn that the island also has a Forbidden Zone and that this
was where Knuckles' father turned over guardianship of the island
before leaving his son.  I won't say how, exactly, but let's just
say that Knuckles' old man sure knows how to make an exit!
     VERY impressive layout on the top of page 7 and in the upper
left panels of page 8.  Though I prefer dialogue to soliloquy,
the latter was effectively used.  So it looks like, after months
of 2-page vamping, we're getting ready to get on with the
Knuckles story.
     P.S.: a 1-page ad displays the covers for Sonic #34 (is
Sonic being captured by Uncle Chuck?), and all three Knuckles
miniseries covers...as if the resumption of the Knuckles solo
story in #34 weren't enough.  If I were Knuckles, I'd ask for
more money!

Here in the UK they used to put 'Adv. of Sonic' and what you call 
'weekend sonic' on at 7am ch4 on saturday morning.  They seemed to mix 
'Adv. of Sonic' with 'weekend sonic' so you never knew what you were 
going to get.  I have seen all the 'Adv. of sonic' episodes but I 
greatly prefer 'weekend sonic' because they have a deeper story line.  
Is there any one else in the UK that wants 'weekend sonic' back on c4?  
Does anyone know if it will be back?

Thakx,

p.s.  I have uploaded some Sonic the Hedgehog 256 colour animated 
cursors for Windows 95 in

     Hi!
       Remember Sonic #25? I'd like to give my comments on it. I know it's
pretty old... but I'm new here on the list and I'd like to anyway.
WARNING! SPOILERS! (Aooga! Aooga!)

                     "GO AHEAD... MECHA MY DAY!"
       
                    A wonderful Sonic CD adaption.   
         
      The good- Mecha Sonic. Of all Sonic Clones, he's the most different.
When Snively was dressed like Robotnik, reading off cue cards.
                "Royalty just ain't what it used to be... I wonder if
Princess Di had                   days like this?"
                Robotnik steals Sonic-Gram letters... so THAT'S where they went!
      The bad- The "Wizard of Oz" thing only worked for me a little.
               What are ads doing in a "Special Issue"? They knew this.
               Why did Doc 'Botnik create a smushing device? He darn well
knows Sonic's                 faster than just about anything.
               It's just me, but I don't think zooming on a rocket pack,
with your legs                  in the air, would _melt_ your legs.
     The Ugly- Robotnik
               Robotnik
               Robotnik 
               Robotnik
               Did I mention Robotnik?

          Oh, and by the way, here's here's the characters at the end. (Left
to Right)  
 
    Mecha Sonic, Doc Robotnik, 4 or 5 Swatbots.
    Penelope (I think), Amy Rose, Rotor, Geoffrey St. John, ???.
    ???, Knuckles, Sonic, Sally, Bunnie Rabbot.
    Uncle Chuck, Muttski, Tails, Antoine, some lizard???.
    ???, Caterkiller, Psuedo Sonic, Coconuts, Snively.
    Evil Sally, Grounder (More Burrobot-like), Winged Killer Dog, Evil
Rotor, Robot        Uncle Chuck.

Do you suppose that if Marvel vs. DC had nearly as many fight pages as 
Sonic vs. Knuckles did, the former would be a bit more popular?  :^)

Just my impression, based on reading rec.arts.comics.marvel.universe - 
I haven't bought the actual books themselves...

   Hi!
    S'more comments on Sonic the Hedgehog's Triple Trouble Special.
               SPOILERS AHOY!


                   "TTTRIPLE TTTROUBLE!"

    The Good- This comic needs MORE KNUCKLES! We got him. We got him good.
              Nice Holo-Wristwatch. Quick! Hit Mute! :-)
              Mt. Osohai... Heh, heh.
              Tsk, tsk. Sonic and Knuckles have a little tiff.
              Right before the emerald comes burrowing out- A breakfast break!
                    
    The Bad- I wish I knew more about this "Ancient Walker" stuff.
             Page 23: How did Nack turn all yellow?
             How did Knux know it was a Sky Cycle?
             Eh. Sonic's Figure eight Peel-Out was drawn crude.
             
    The Ugly- Lose the hat, Nack.
 
           In overall, it's good, but it could have been better.          
             "SUBMERSIBLE REHEARSAL"
   
  The Good- A nice looking Sea Fox
            The plot! 
            Tails's suave acting
            Oh-ho! Nice speech about helping, Tails.
            One word- MISSILES! Blow 'em outta the water, Tails!
            Manifique art. Not half bad either.
  The Bad- When Tails obliterated the Roboticizer, he wasn't very close, and
neither was             Octobot. How did they get fountained out of the water?
           Nooooooo!!!! Not a really bad pun!!!!
           What the HECK does Rotor mean by "too young"? Is he too young to
go on             Adventures? No!
           Octobot doesn't give much a fight.
   The Ugly- Octobot.
        
         Overall, the same rating as TTTriple TTTrouble.
              "FIRST CONTACT"
   The Good- Finally! A Knuckles Solo!
             Catweazle. Laugh just thinkin' about that name.
             Page 3: HELLO!
   The Bad- The Ax-bot is from Sonic and Knuckles, not Chaotix.
            Page 4: Where'd that fireball come from?
            The Chaos Chamber was smaller in TTTriple TTTrouble.
   The Ugly- Can't get much uglier than Mr. Ax-Bot. Except his creator. :-)
  
          Overall, it was a little worse than the other stories.
 
                                                                 Later, 
                                                                Ian Pugh

I want "weekend Sonic" back on TCC! There are 5 times as much adventures 
of Sonic as there are "Weekend", so it'll be months before they show 
"weekend" again! =(

That reminds me to say that the `Saturday' Sonic is showing once
again in Australia.  Yay!  (..and now I have a large-screen
television to watch it all on.  Bliss :)

It's the first season being shown at the moment, but I expect the
TEN network have the second season and are reshowing the first to
bring everyone up to speed on the story.  (It's been ~2 years since
the cartoon was last aired in this country.)

(I'm somewhat worried at that I no longer find the theme musak as
irritating as I did before. :)

The episodes that are on, is it the third season of the ABC Sonic?  I really
want to know what happened to Snivlely!

It would be interesting if it were so, because Sonic only lasted two
seasons on ABC.  As Keeper of the Sonic FAQ File, I ought to know.
