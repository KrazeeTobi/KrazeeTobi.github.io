I sure do, and--I know this is off-topic but--are you keeping track of who
Marvel and DC are going around each other lately.  Now they created a
*hybird* Comic universe where they took the two comics and mixed them in a
blender!!  Good God!!  Storm's Wonder Woman while Diana's dating the
Punisher!!  Superboy's Spiderman while Clark's Captain America!!  Bruce
Wane's in Shield and Wolverine's gone Basty?!?!  The Justice Legue now has
X-Men and Magnteo's. . . . . uhhhhh . . . .

USA does run the former-Saturday series on Sunday mornings.

It's a pretty safe bet that whoever forwards listings data to the 
listings service has never watched the show, and no one at the listings 
service has ever watched the show either.  So they probably think that 
"Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" can be used 
interchangably or that they are one and the same.  TV listings are never 
100% accurate anyway (fortunately most listings services still strive for 
100% best they can).

	I don't think it would. Being an SM fan, I think it would ruin both 
shows.

Hey can you imagine it? Sailor moon and Sonic?
Moon power give me the ring? Sounds cool! A story for the fanfic would be
really great for the Sailor moon's fans in the Sonic lists...BTW.I love the
Sailor Moon series! Is there another Sailor Moon fan in the Sonic lists?

See you! Your pal Alejandra!

#34  [May 1996]
     Spaziante cover.  Scott lets it be known, merely in passing,
that Spaziante has been the regular cover artist since #31.  Like
we couldn't have figured that out.
     "To Bot Or Not To Bot"
     Story: Angelo DeCesare; Art: Brian Thomas (debut)
     The story starts out with a jolt, as Uncle Chuck and Muttski
endure yet another failed attempt at being deroboticized. 
Meanwhile, the scene shifts to Robotropolis in a panel which (in
an echo of the opening credits of StH) reminds us that the city
is on the shore of a lake or bay.  Seems to me this is a useful
plot point, but anyway.  Robotnik has watched "Patton" once too
often and has assembled a troop of Combots, camouflaged soldier
bots with which he plans to attack the Great Forest.  Robotnik
loses the element of surprise, however, because Dulcy has
overheard his plans.  She doesn't repeat the message exactly
right but Sally gets the picture.  Sonic, Uncle Chuck and Muttski
return to Robotropolis to take out the Combots.  Once inside the
compound, however, Robotnik zaps Uncle Chuck and Muttski to bring
their minds back under his control.  Uncle Chuck arrests Sonic.
     The next morning, Tails, Bunnie and Antoine return from
patrol to report no sign of Sonic.  The three of them are wearing
the same black turtleneck sweater and knit stocking cap
combination they last wore in "That's The Spirit!" [Sonic #20] --
just the thing for late night commando operations or a casual
evening of stalking your ex-wife [Freedom Fighter outfits
provided by O.J.'s of Brentwood].  Sonic shows up soon enough --
lashed to the front of a tank Robotnik is driving at the head of
his Combots.  Very sadistic touch -- I LOVE IT!  Sally calls
retreat and has the freedom fighters abandon Knothole for an
underground shelter.  Unfortunately, Robotnik cuts them off. 
However, when Robotnik gives the Combots the order to flatten the
Great Forest, they malfunction by turning around and marching off
the nearest cliff.  At the same time Sonic has managed to escape
his bonds and has commandeered Robotnik's tank. Robotnik and
Snively beat a retreat in a hover craft driven by Uncle Chuck.
     Wha' hoppened?  Thanks to Rotor's exposition, we learn that
Rotor had fitted both Uncle Chuck and Muttski with neuro-
overriders -- the same electronic gizmos that DIDN'T work for
Sally in "Steel Belted Sally" [the infamous Sonic #29].  Amazing
what a drop of solder in the right place can do.  So while
pretending to be back under Robotnik's influence, Uncle Chuck was
able to reprogram the Combots and make sure that Sonic could
escape easily from being lashed to the tank.  It also helps
maintain his cover and gets him back in the spy business.
     Brian's artwork isn't seriously off-model, and his rendering
of Dulcy is especially dead-on.  Still, his rendering of the
Mobians (especially the females) has them looking a little too
cute.  No matter; welcome aboard, B.T.!
     A Sense of History, Part I
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Penders
     After months of two-page vamps, Kanterovich & Penders start
into the 3-parter prelude to the next Knuckles miniseries.  It
begins with a recap of echidnoid civilization:
     Once upon a time, the echidnas were the top of the Mobian
heap in terms of having an advanced civilization centered in
Echidnapolis, an island city surrounded by the Great River (once
again, for all their advances, they do have a knack for taking
only one adjective, "Great", and running it into the ground). 
Which would have been the fate of Echidnapolis if a couple
distant relatives of Knuckles hadn't determined that a white
comet was going to wipe out the city.  To avert this disaster,
the populace fanned out to gather together a dozen chaos emeralds
and place them in subterranean caverns beneath the city.  This
caused the island city to become a floating island, just in time.
Which was all well and good, according to Knuckles our narrator,
except that this somehow ties in with the creation of Mount Fate
and the appearance of a great menace.  To be continued.
     Was it worth the wait?  For me it was, but then again I'm a
sucker for a good origins story.  You get an idea of how many
hair styles an echidna is capable of, and there's a VERY nice use
of close-up at the top of page 6.  Aside from the fact that the
situation reminded me a little too much of the fate of the planet
Krypton (in a "What if..." sort of way), Kanterovich & Penders
have pulled it off.
     Sonic-Grams: I have a really hard time believing that kids
are writing to ask Scott Fulop to be a pen pal.  It's a little
like saying that, in the heyday of the New Yorker when they were
running cartoons by Thurber, that fan mail was coming in
addressed to Harold Ross!  Then again, recent communiques by Ken
Penders have spoken of Fulop almost as if he were the editor in
the past tense.  So perhaps the guard has changed and we haven't
been told yet.  Let's cut to the chase: Sonic #35 will attempt to
answer questions concerning Sonic and the power rings (the cover
art shows Sonic and what appear to be the masks of the Ancient
Walk-Ons...er, Walkers).  Bunnie fanboy alert: she's scheduled to
do a solo story in Sonic #37 (Rich Koslowski handling both script
and art) and will be a featured player in an upcoming two-parter
(script by Gallagher, art by Spaziante -- talk about your odd
couples!).  Espio will also be getting a solo shot.  Nathan Gropp
of Rochester, Indiana, wants to know if E.V.E. [Sonic #21] will
be coming back into the story; the response indicates that it all
depends on fan response.  OK, all you Fiona Fox fans out there,
you have your work cut out for you!

Note: please substitute these updated questions in the FAQ File.  A tip
of the echidnoid dreadlocks to Ken Penders for permission to quote him.


Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?

A:   "That the Princess Sally miniseries came out at all is a
minor miracle," according to Ken Penders, co-writer of the series
with Mike Kanterovich.  Archie Comics was late in rolling out the
three-part miniseries starring Sally as the main character--a
situation acknowledged in the SonicGram of #21.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either did or didn't feature Sally doing battle with
a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
SEGA reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences."

"In fairness to the people at SEGA," Ken writes, "they wanted to
create a viable environment where the public would be
anticipating more Princess Sally products such as her own video
game or line of t-shirts or whatever, and the ...[mini]series
represented the beginning of that, so it was important to them
that it was done the best it could be."  "Scott [Fulop]," he
adds, "was pulling his hair out during the entire process doing
his best to keep things moving along."

So why haven't there been subsequent Sally miniseries?  "The
Princess Sally miniseries just didn't do well enough to warrant
another shot.  From what we can tell, it seems there was a
problem with distribution which prevented a lot of people from
finding and picking up the book.  You also had the core audience
of little boys that [sic] felt awkward picking up a title that
they felt was aimed more at girls.  However, when you plopped a
copy into their hands and made them read the first issue, that's
all it took.  They were hooked."




Q11: What exactly is in those chili dogs?

Q11: What exactly is in those chili dogs?
A:   When a story is set on a planet populated by sentient
animals, the question of their eating habits is no small matter. 
How would a planet whose population would include intelligent
cows and pigs deal with the subject of eating something usually
thought to be made out of pork and/or beef?  While several
members of the Sonic mailing list have suggested that the dogs in
Sonic's chili dogs are fashioned from some meat analog (see
below), a possible answer appeared at the end of "Let's Get
Small" (Sonic #33).  In the last panel, Sonic whips up a batch of
chicken soup which, Rotor explains, is "made with chili dogs." 
Since you can't very well call it "chicken soup" if it doesn't
contain any chicken (at least as far as government regulations
are concerned), it would appear that those chili dogs Sonic has
been scarfing for all these years are made using chicken franks! 

This theory elicited the following response from Ken Penders:
"they're made from soybeans or some form of seafood by-products,
and let's leave it at that.  Sheeesh!  Some things are better off
left alone!"  Not as far as THIS crowd is concerned.  You knew
the job was dangerous when you took it, Ken.

Do you mean "Kitsune"?  If that's what you mean, I'd like to say 
Kitsune's are sweet.  But that's a different story.  Are there any 
Kitsune charachters on this STh list?  thanx...;)

To EVERYONE:

Kiken here, I greatly appologize for the inclusion of the pic. No-one 
told me that attachments were taboo. I was debating wether or not I 
should send it, but then one of my fellow furs suggested that I should. 
I'm not placing the blaim on him though, I take responsibility for my 
actions. Thank you for verifying though.

As to the pic's looks. Actually, I'm a huge fan of anime, I can pretty 
much recognize the individual styles and the styles of the various manga 
art schools. But I had never before seen a character that resembled Tails 
so much as Karzu. Oh well, you live and learn.

And to Ian Pugh. I'm gonna check up on those sounds that you asked about. 
Even though they are game related. I'll just tell this, Sonic Team have 
NEVER finished fully programming a Sonic game to date. If you want to 
know more about that, E-mail me (not the list). As gametalk is almost 
about as bad as binaries. :)

Kiken signing off.
ASOBIWA...OWARIDA!
Sayonara.

I'm glad that you did.  Those that have to pay by the byte....<takes a

Yes, you do.  I would personally ask Ratman before you decide NOT to do 
it again.

Saturday Show but without new series...  What's the point.

                    It's been fun!!!!!!!!!!!   Thanks

I think you guys are completely missing the point.
First of all, ignorance is no excuse. Here is a paragraph from the 
message that gets sent to you when you subscribe:

--- cut ---
Please do not post any of the following types of material: files,
commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.  If you do,
you are subject to immediate removal from the list and suspension or
termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt, please contact
the list manager before posting.  Sonic-related fan fiction, images,
and sounds may be uploaded by ftp to rat.org or mailed to rat@rat.org.
--- cut ---

You see the point is, posting files to the mailing lit is strictly forbidden.
Nobody should EVER post a file. Period. This is not up for debate.

If you want to share a file, upload it to rat.org, or email it to just 
me, and I'll put it on the site. Then you can meantion that the file is 
on rat.org, and talk about it or whatever, but flat out posting the damn 
file to the list is a definate no-no.

If you want to discuss this matter further, then write to me or other
interested parties OFF LIST.

Jeez, A little touchy,aren't ya?
Kiken sent the pic attached because he wanted some people to notice more,
call something to our attention..I'm sorry,but if he had just included it on
his website or something, I prob would have put it off,but now I actually
see how much of a rip-off it is.Plus, it was a one-time fluke..

I am sorry for the ,well, rudeness of my letter, but it had to be said.

Do you know what "off list" means? It means do not reply to the mailing list.
You have been unsubscribed.
Anyone replying to this message on the list will be automatically unsubscribed. 
One more time for the not-too-bright: DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE ON THE 
LIST. That means DO NOT write to the mailing list. If you really feel 
like writing me, write to rat@rat.org. DO NOT write to the mailing list 
about this. OK?

I was looking through a local Waldenbooks today (local being Worcester, 
MA), when I decided to look in the comics section.  There, I was 
surprised to find collector's editions of Archie Sonic #0 and Sonic In 
your Face #1, each packaged with Triple Trouble #1.  Naturally, I bought 
them (not having seen any issues before #25).  I'm wondering if any of 
you have seen these and if there are any other Collector's Editions out 
there.

Emphasis on the one-time fluke.  Just file it up under "Experience," Kiken,
and go on.  I advise setting up your own web page for your artwork and
posting invitiations to go there in this mailing list.  That's kosher
according to Ratman.

As far as I know of, there is no dedicated Sonic MUD.

If you don't mind doing some exploration, you can look through these Web
pages and maybe find one.  (And please post the location if you find one!)

Kiken here, no Sonic Remix CD is not Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom is a 
compilation of music from the US Sonic CD and Sonic Spinball. Sonic 
Remix, which is actually titled Sonic Dance Power 4, is a compilation of 
original pieces of music by original artists. It is not music from the games.
Also, the CD is from Holland, but all the music on it is in English. If 
there is more interest in the CD, I'll send a message with all the tracks 
and their respective artists, and the style of music that's on them.

Kiken here, I do have my own homepage, Rat has a link to it, Sega of 
America has a link to it, and so do numerous other sites. Everyone knows 
me for having the only Japanese Sonic site on the web. Look down at my 
signature, the URL is clearly posted there.

Watch a epsode and type to down like story.  If people want I could do this,
let me see now I think one epsode writen on paper a week would be good.

This should give a boost to Sonic story writers.

If you're talking about transcribing the whole episode, you'd better hope 
no one from SEGA or DIC read this message.  References to the episode or 
even sound bites taken from them, they might allow.  But, transcribing 
the entire episode...?!

I don't know about that; I transcribed "Buster's Guide to Dating" from Tiny 
Toons and posted it to alt.tv.tiny-toon and nobody nailed me on it :^)
(BTW, if anybody wants a copy, e-mail me, not the list.)

RDB, can't think of a Sonic episode good enough to transcribe though...

To subscribe, e-mail a message to majordomo@lists.mv.net.  The message 
should say in the body "subscribe sonic your_full_internet_address 
<your_name>", and on the next line "end".  Do not include the quotation 
marks.  If there are any problems, let me know.  You can find more info. 
at http://rat.org.  First, click on "Sonic fandom", then on "mailing list 
page."

To post a message, send it to the "sonic@bort.mv.net" address.  There are 
two things you should know about this list: 1.)Binaries are not to be 
posted to it, and 2.)It's for discussion of the Sonic characters/universe 
only, NOT the Sonic games.

ps.-The majordomo software doesn't seem to include the internet address 
of the sender of a message, so you might want to include it in a .sig 
file at the end of your messages, so people can reply to you directly 
should they so choose.

Well I have started on the epsode Super Sonic the first one aired.  I'll do
the dialog first the add the action and naration next.  I don't think Sega
will mind as long as I give them and DIC the credits.  After all they took
it off the air
what would be the harm of retyping it on paper.  IF anything it'll inprove
and remind what people have missed for a long time.

If anyone wishs to help leave me E-mail.
This a nonprofet production.  It will be free to everyone.

The correct posting address is sonic@lists.mv.net.  This isn't a 
technical list, so suffice it to say bort is the server that sends list 
messages to you.

It does.  If you look at the header of a list message, you'll see that 
the sender's address is in the From: field and the list's address is in 
the Reply To: field.  Many mail programs will (or can be configured to) 
ask you which address you want your reply to go to.  Use of a signature 
is still a good idea because the sender's address can get mangled by 
gateways, etc.

Does it really make a difference?  I always send my posts to 
sonic@bort.mv.net, and they always make it to the list.

        This sonic-mailing list is way past cool! I THINK I under stand how
it works now. You post a message and everone recives everyone's message?  (I
just got off of AOL and neve really used E-mail, so I'm new to this) I'd
better not say anything else untill I'm positive I know what I'm doing.

Sending posts to bort is not guaranteed to work.  The list has been moved 
before, and should it move again, you won't be able to send posts to bort 
anymore, but lists will continue to work indefintely as long as the list 
is hosted in the mv.net domain.  The Reply To: field will be changed to 
the lists server at some point in the future.

Any further technical discussions should be conducted in direct e-mail 
(sonic@rat.org and/or rat@rat.org) and not on the list.

They will borth work for now, but if we ever decide to move the lists 
over to a new server, bort will no longer work. lists.mv.net always will.

I'd also like to point out that if anyone can actually post to the list, they
are already subscribed. If you're not on the list and try to post, it will
refuse it.

SO THAT MEANS if you see anyone post a newbie question, you can bet the list
admins are on the case. You don't need to reply to the list. So as much as
you might feel like you're helping, you're just cluttering the list up with
junk. If you really feel like lending a hand (or paw), please do it in
private email to the person that needs the help.

just got off of AOL and neve really used E-mail, so I'm new to this) I'd
better not say anything else untill I'm positive I know what I'm doing.

Dear Paul,
It's me again, Robert Shiels.
Thanks for the example of what you are doing.
Are you going to be selling the finished item or are you going to put it up on 
the net?

P.S. Need any help?

Hmm.. maybe, but are you sure that the burlap wouldn't chafe?

  Hi all!
      I was watching TV. A Micro Machines "Crash and Smash Commercial" to be
exact. And lo and behold! What did I see? Why it was our hero, Sonic the
Hedgehog on a little go-cart holding a ring, as a little Micro Machine! Has
anybody else seen this?

                                                                 Later,

Kiken here, woah! First I've heard. I'll have to keep my eyes pealed in 
Toys R Us for em when I go back home. It'll be an interesting little 
collector's item. Watch them cost $50 as well. ;)

Have I seen this?  No.  Am I interested?  Yes! ;)  BTW- I will (soon) 
have a CGI script on my page where you will be able to do cool stuff, 
like purchase (via the web) weird, unusual, and most importantly, RARE 
Sonic merchandise.  The cost will be strictly to pay for the thing 
(depending on what it is) along /w/ paying 4 postage.  It'll be sweet.

Orrigional Sonic T's, Sonic mouse pads.  I hope it's legal!  If so, it'll 
be cool.

Hey, I like Nintendo, too, so don't tear on `em!  :)

(Actually, I like Nintendo better, and I wouldn't touch Sega if it 
weren't for Sega..)  <grinning, runs for cover>

    Hi again!
        Hiya, everybody! All who wrote to me sure did excite me. But here's
what I really liked:

 >I saw it. I bet the Nintendo lovers would have a grand time smashing him
 >against walls.
 
 Oh, I could imagine-

   Nintendo Lover: (Looking at Micro Sonic) Ooh. I think I'll but that.
   Mom: Are you sure? You've always had liked Nintendo.
   Nintendo Lover (Evil Grin): Oooohh yeah. 

    BUT... we all know that Sonic T. Hedgehog is the superior hedgehog!

   Also, I'd like to take this moment to say- from this moment on, I will be
known as "Eggman" (Only Kiken should probably know why)....
 
                                                                     Later,
                                                                     Eggman

Actually I don't like either platform. I just like the Sonic universe.  The
characters. The Sat AM show hooked me in, not the games. 
In fact, I find it humorous that when Sega wanted me to sign the papers 
letting me using their material for my site, they thought I was doing to 
do something related to their games.
Oh well, I guess this is a misconception I have to live with. Like the 
one about cartoons being for kids. Sonic is not for Sega lovers only, 
please get it right. It's their own fault for making such cool characters. 
:-)

Kiken here, well I own a Nintendo and a Playstation as well as a 
Genesis/MegaDrive, SegaCD/MegaCD, and Saturn. But lets face it. 
Out of all those characters on those systems, it seems that Sonic is just 
the best. The Saturday morning Sonic series basically blows away any other 
attempts at US videogame cartoons. Lets face it, the Super Mario 
Bros. Super Show was really lame.

Kiken signing off.

COOL!  That would rule!  I'd LOVE to see a Japanese, Chinese or any totally
non=Romantic language dubbed version. heh.. (seeing as how I speak a
latin-based language too... it'd be pretty boring to hear it in spanish or
italian).

Unless Sega changes directions again, it's not likely to happen. :-(

I became a true blue fan of Sonic and his world right after Sonic's 16th
(15th? I'll have to look it up) birthday, back in November of 1991. That was
when the original game was released. I'm far more  of a Sonic fan than a
Sega one, I have only ever upgraded the Sega as needed to run the newer
Sonic games, and it doesn't look like I'll have any reason to buy a Saturn.

Sega has changed it's direction entirely last year, and moved into a
fighting games. They seem to have pushed Sonic and his friends out of the
picture altogether. Last November (Sonic's birthday) went by without a new
Genesis release for the first time since 91, and now Hedgehog Day (Sega's
re-name for Febuary 2nd, another release day for Sonic) has passed without a
whimper as well. Sega even cancelled thier own magazine (Sega Visions) a few
months ago, not that it's had any new Sonic comics, or anything Sonic for
that matter, for the last 6 months or so.

Until Sega produces new Sonic games, we are not likely to see anyone make
any more animated shows. It is a sad fact that the cartoon industry is only
driven by whether or not the show sells toys, and not by popularity.

Kiken here, well after the falling out between Sega and Dic, chances are 
slim that the series will ever have a third season. Sega of America are 
putting Bug as their mascot now. So chances are you'll see a cartoon 
based on that game soon. As for Sonic, I guess SOA figure that they're 
making enough money from current game, merchandise, and liscencing rights  
to leave things be. Sega Enterprises are pretty much going the same way, 
Sonic is being phased out to make way for newer characters, mainly those 
from the Virtua Fighter games (there's already an anime based on this 
series, not that its anything to toot a horn at). 

I guess its a catch 22 for both companies, they want to keep interest 
high on the charatcers but at the same time they want to introduce 
new ones so the old ones don't become "boring".

Kiken here, well, there's still a slim chance that V Sonic will make it 
to the states on the Saturn, this may re-awaken things. Thats a long shot 
though, and an even longer shot is hoping that SOA will release Figthing 
Sonic in the states at all. 
BTW: According to the Japanese, he was 16 in Sonic 1.

        Ratman, I couldn't agree more. I actullay use to like nintendo, but
Sonic was so cool I had to get a Sega (I lost intrest in game systems, you
can't keep up with them!). I still get Sonic games but I my intrest is in
the comics and the cartoon (they do show the good version of Sonic on USA
every sunday at 9:00 EST). I wish they made ney episodes...maybe from the
comic or something.

 The Saturday morning Sonic series basically blows away any other 
>attempts at US videogame cartoons. Lets face it, the Super Mario 
>Bros. Super Show was really lame.

     I think that the Sonic show had some really great things going for it,
which no other cartoon studios seem to have latched on to. Sonic had a
really great plot going for it. that's probably because they didn't just
stay true to the games. I mean, how many characters from the show were
actually in games? 2 or 3? The attitude that cartoon spinoffs have to remain
"pure" doesn't really make sense. The Super mario Brothers cartoons were
pretty lame because the same thing happened every episode; i.e. what
happened in the games. 1) Koopa kidnaps Princess.(Surprise!) 2) Mario
Brothers Attempt rescue (*Gasp!* Can they do it?) 3) Princess is
rescued,(Whew! That was a close one.) 4) Show ends, see ya tomorrow. SMB
isn't the only example of this kind of failure, so why do cartoon studios
continue to turn out this trite and boring material? (Somebody already
brought this up. The answer is $$$MONEY$$$)
     The creative team for Sonic actually tried to be original. New
characters, new ideas, and most importantly, they tried to develop the
characters' personalities. During each show, we learned more about what
makes them tick. They became more familiar and easier to relate to. On the
other hand, most other cartoon characters remain static and really
unrealistic. It seems like many writers don't give kids enough credit. I
really think that an 8 year old can grasp the concept of someone having a
personality. I was around 9 or 10 when the Super Mario Brothers were on, and
I didn't like it. It was too predictable. I've found that most of the stuff
that's on Saturday mornings now isn't even worth watching. Too bad. The
Sonic show was an oasis in a desert of boring television. If they brought
the show back, I would be really happy. Unfortunately, I think we can safely
say that it isn't going to happen. :( 
     There's always reruns... :)

Later...

-Matt

    Hi Everybody!
               I liked all these comments you gave me. I guess it caused a
lot of contraversy. Remember when I wrote "A Cancel Job"? It was about how
USA cut out humorous parts in The Adventures of Sonic. I was watching it
today when I said to myself, "Man! This isn't a cut... this is a serious
CHOP!" It was a RIDICULOUS cut out in the episode "Submerged Sonic". It had
cut out how Sonic, Tails and Surf got out of the prison they were in. It
took 2 precious minutes away. I think the show shouldn't go back to Fox, but
be on ABC. The same for the Weekend Sonic. Perhaps they can combine and make
something called, "The Supersonic Sonic hour!" or something. Just keep it
away from USA, where it won't chop the humor.

                                                                       Later,
                                                                       Eggman

Not to worry I am resurecting the show in text format.
If all goes well I have the first epsiode finshed in about 2 days.  I work
so I can't be typing all the time.

I liked Sonic the first time I saw the game in a store display.  The thing
I liked about Sonic was how fast the game could be.  Sonic didn't plod
along like UberMario did.

I didn't get a Genesis until a few years later when I felt I could afford
one...  Sega also had a special [Get a Genesis w/ Sonic and get Sonic 2 at
no extra cost]. 

I first heard about and saw the cartoon at the Chicago Consumer
Electronics Show a few months before it was on TV [I didn't watch much of
it at the show because the sound wasn't loud enough and there was lots to
see and time was running out]. 

I wasn't expecting too much of it because so many shows based on toys or
games were so pitiful ["Potato Head Kids" was possibly the WORST of the
bunch... anyone else see that unwatchable peice of garbage?  Often I like
an occasional dumb and stupid show on TV once in a while but THAT show
couldn't even suck in new and interesting ways]. 

I was pleasently mistaken about the Sonic Cartoon.  I liked Sonic before,
but I liked him much more when the cartoon came out.

I was disappointed that so few episodes were made (ABC didn't help matters
by showing the cartoon twice each saturday... 7 weeks and you're already
in reruns).  I stopped watching it after a few months since I had all the
episodes on tape (well... all except one it turned out)  (I learned about
the second season a few months after it had started airing).

Anyway... Enough of that:

Fight games in general are a 'rage'.  You go to video game arcades and more
than half the new games are fight games it seems.

I've never been able to get into games like that though.  If I wanted to 
learn thousands of different stimulus-response reactions, then I'd learn
a REAL martial art as opposed to faking one in a game...  For games... 
just gimme something I can BLOW UP!

Only a SLIM chance for Virtua Sonic?  How come it seems that half of Sega's
games don't make it to the US?  No wonder I keep hearing that
Sega's Saturn isn't doing all that well (Compared to PlayStation).  

What's this about a Sonic Fighting game?  How can you make Sonic a 
fighting game?!  I thought people were confusing Virtua Sonic with a
'Sonic Fighting Game' but now you're saying they're two separate entities?

 - - -

One thing which has always given me some hope for Sonic though... You
still see new products featuring the spiny blue guy (e.g. Sonic Pasta... 
Sonic watch offer on Quaker Oatmeal... Sonic books) If they're phasing
Sonic out, why would they bother (I know it takes months to plan these
deals out but the last big Sonic game was out over a YEAR ago?  It almost
sounds like they're paving the way for a comeback (or maybe that's just 
wishful thinking)).

I kinda liked the early Super Mario Bros Super Show.  It had Lou Albano
(sp?) (an ex pro-wrestler) as Mario!  I also thought King Koopa was cute! 
Once they replaced him with those lame-o surfer-dude rejects and added all
those Koopa Kids the show was unwatchable.

Same here... The best two new shows out there these days are:

   The Tick
   Earthworm Jim  ( Sunday mornings )

  (Princess What's-Her-Name in Earthworm Jim sounds a lot like 
   Princess Sally... Not suprising... Same person does the voice,
   Kathy Souci (sp?)  [also the voice of Fifi LaFume].

It can be about both, as well as the comics.  However, about 99.9% of the 
discussion is about "Sonic the Hedgehog" and the Archie Sonic comic, not 
"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog".

Unfortunately, I haven't seen it. It doesn't air around here, as far as I
know. I've checked the TV Guide repeatedly. I have downloaded some audio
clips from the show off of Usenet, and it sounds hilarious! the idea of
someone being destroyed upon the lathe of heaven, the great cordless belt
sander of nirvana, or even the bandsaw of paradise really piqued my
curiosity! (I don't suppose this airs on USA or some national cable channel?
The basic network programming is different all over the country...)

Well, as I've occasionally posted to alt.tv.tiny-toon, I've never been one

Yeah, it's sad... but that's the realistic side of cartooning.  I'm sure
animators and others who worked on it would LOVE to continue these projects,
however--unless toys sell and commercials pay enough for everyone to get
their cut and make a living...  aw well. :/

Would be neat if DIC did what the REBOOT guys are doing and just keep making

Here's what I am predicting for Sonic: 

Over the next few months, Sega will slowly but surely increase Sonic's
popularity, until the Ultra 64 comes out, Sega's main competition. Then
they'll counter it with an excellent Virtua Sonic and Fighting Sonic, and
bring Sonic back in an uproar! Maybe a third season of Sonic, maybe a series
spinoff withn Knuckles, who knows?

Kiken here, well I can't disagree with that last saying. But as for 
taking a real martial art, as an Aikidoka myself, believe me when I tell 
you its nice to be able to participate in a fight that only costs you 50

Like I said before, SOA are trying to phase out Sonic and bring in Bug. 
And after what SOA did to Sonic CD I seriously worry about what will 
happen to V Sonic if it is released over here. 

Yes, V Sonic and Fighting Sonic are two entirely different games. 
Fighting Sonic is being done by AM2 (SOJ's 3D rendering masters under the 
watchful eyes of Yu Suzuki, expect it to play like Fighting Vipers) and V 
Sonic is being done by Sonic Team (the same members who programmed the 
Mega CD version of Sonic CD to be exact, so with Yuji Naka at the head, 
nothing can go wrong). V Sonic will be shown at E3 this summer.

Well, blame the never released games on SOA's "masterful" advertising 
department.   

BTW: Sega is ahead of Sony in both the US and Japan. Its just that the 
Americans are a little more aprehensive becuase they still have the bad 
taste of the 32X in their mouths.

I had noticed that. Its interesting to see all of this Sonic merchandise 
appear, as you stated, a good year after the last big release. SOA is 
still finding Sonic marketable, surely enough, stuff with Sonic on it 
does sell, and well at that. What is SOA up to? Or perhaps they see that 
the comic is selling so well that continued liscencing of products will 
sell becuase the comic does so well. I guess time will tell.

	Yes, I've seen it as well.  they also show what appears to be one

Well, someone has to represent that 00.1%. :-)

Are there any other "Adventures" fans on this list besides me?

        For thoses of you who are wondring, The Cartoon With the Freedom
fighters in is the good one! That other one was some kind of wierd one (I
didn't like). 

        Theres also one other topic, I don't think Sega will suport Sonic
any more, so I think they should let matters in to some one else's hands,
since Sega doesn't care for Sonic any more (personally, I never did like
Sega, sometimes I think there real jerks but thats a whloe differnt story).
There are probably people out there who would like Sonic, but I noticed A
LOT of them don't even know Sonic comics and even the cartoon ever exsisted
(did I spell that right?)!!! And Sega Isn't going to adverise or anything.
Most people I know think Sonic's some hedgehog who goes saveing the wrold
and toasting robots so the animals can escape. There way more then that!

Don't get me started.

I wouldn't be so quick to write off Sega's interest in Sonic.  If I read
Ken Penders' communications to this group correctly, Sega has continued
to seriously look over the shoulders of the writers and artists at
Archie, and have not been shy about making suggestions about "improving"
various stories, including the Sally miniseries.

While this has the down side of looking as if Sega is meddling in the
artistic process (acting as corporate guardians of Sonic's reputation),
it DOES indicate an ongoing interest in the character, whether or not
he/it remains the prime logo.

Maybe that's OUR job.  As members of the fan community we end up getting
the word out.

This is to all concerned -

SEGA has a very strong vested interest in the little blue critter. The
problem is maintaining fan support among the GAMING SYSTEMS, from what I can
tell. Let's put it this way. There was Atari, then the Commodore, then the
Amiga, then finally Nintendo unleashed the Super Mario Bros. and became a
monster. SEGA struck back with SONIC on the GENESIS SYSTEM and defeated
Mario. They countered with GAME GEAR which was superior to Game Boy. They
came out with the CD SYSTEM while  Nintendo was reeling with the Super NES.
But then came the 3DO and SONY PLAYSTATION and other CD format systems,
creating confusion in the market place. Instead of getting the SATURN out to
counter these other systems, SEGA made a Nintendo-like mistake by coming out
with the 32-X. 

Right now, there's a shake-up going on in the marketplace. Only so much
product can receive public support before the public says enough and clamors
for sanity. The public right now wants to feel they aren't buying a system
that'll be out of date by next year. So far, the best compromise seems to be
buying games you can play on your PC, instead of messingaround trying to
figure out which is the best system to get.

People like me are frustrated because while I like SEGA gaming systems and
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG games as well as a variety of others, right now games are
going exclusively with certain systems instead of being available for every
platform like they used to be. For instance, I'm looking forward to playing
the new GOLDENEYE game, but it's ONLY going to be made available for the
latest Nintendo system. And you're going to see more and more of this sort of
thing as companies fight for a bigger piece of the market share.

SEGA will support SONIC because of his acceptance in the marketplace. They
just may tend to downplay him because they may feel he only attracts a
certain segment of the market, and they want to reach a broader audience.
Only if the fan base makes its support of SONIC known to SEGA will the
corporate suits be able to determine the breadth and depth of that support.

SONIC isn't dead. Not by a long shot.

Ken

    Nope, nuthin.  So I've recruited my own SFC to make one for us.  
Not sure when it'll be up and running, though, but we're working on 
it.  It's written by me, and programmed, among others, by our own 
Z0RO, Swordsman of The Net and Master of Corn! (Remember him?)

    So I've got another few questions:
    
   1. How come no one told me it takes me freakin' forever to access 
that MUD list!

    2. Those Chaos Emeralds- do they serve any real purpose (like 
giving people **specific** super powers), or are they just energy 
stones?

    3. Forgot.  Sorry!
    
    If you think you have any ideas to make the MUD really cool, drop 
me a line at... well, check the sig.  I'm not writing it down, it's 
too long.  Seeya!

SOA still have loads of support on all their platforms (except the 32X). 
But like I keep saying, both Sega companies have decided to push Sonic 
onto the back burner to let their new "heroes" pave the way. To quote the 
head of SOJ, "We don't want Sonic running the Saturn the same way he ran 
the MegaDrive..."
If you look at the Saturn, people are buying it for Sega Rally 
Championship and Virtua Fighter 2, they aren't buying it in hopes of 
playing V Sonic or Fighting Sonic. And as for Fighting Sonic, SOA have 
said outright that they won't release the game in the states. Perhaps a 
ton of mail to them may change this.
As for confusion, there is some, but not as much as you think. There is 
an old saying in gamer's circles, "Buy a system for it's games, not for 
it's specs."

Actually, videogame systems are much more stable than PC's. A videogame 
system takes on average 5 years to become phased out, a new PC does this 
in about 6 months. Not to mention that a computer is a serious investment 
for some people, if all they want to do is play games, what can beat 
paying $90 for a system and then around $50 for games, not to mention 
that a videogame system is much easier to use and doesn't require its 
user to understand OS's.

Well, unless I was mistaken, Sonic is Sega's mascot, and will only ever 
be available on Sega based systems, and perhaps PC's (with the correct 
liscencing agreements), but you won't ever see Sonic on the Playstation 
or on the U64. Cross-liscencing only occurs when the 3rd part company 
finds that all the 1st party companies will support it.

Yes they will, but I always hear talk about this "market segment". 
Perhaps you hadn't figured it out by now, but the white-coats working at 
SOA have absolutely NO idea what we want. This has been proven time and 
time again. And a broader audience? The average age of a US Genesis 
owner is 18, and the average age of a US Sega CD owner is 21, basically 
college students like myself. Those with lots of money to burn. But 
again, its SOA's white-coats who think we want games like Corpse Killer, 
instead of our "childish" Sonic games. This is where the problem comes in.

> SONIC isn't dead. Not by a long shot.

Sonic will never die so long as there are fans like us to keep him alive.

  Why yes! Me. I watch it because there's more humor involved.
  Don't get me wrong, Weekend Sonic is just as good.

    -The MUD will be very cool.
    -It will be coded by Z0RO, Swrdsman of the Net and Master of Corn 
(rember him?)
    -Do Chaos Emeralds actually serve a **specific** purpose (like 
giving **specific** super powers, or are they just energy stones?
    -Please send ideas at *my email address*!

    Hope it goes through this time.

KEEP THE BLUE WARRIOR ALIVE!!!!!

I lied in the Ultimately Hopeful Sonic Prediction, Sonic can die, but only
if we let him!! If Sega is really plannying on dropping their spiny little
mascot for something else, which seems evident with all the mascot games
they have been producing (Ristar, Vectorman, Bug.) which have thankfully
failed. Sega obviously doesn't know that he has so many fans! We have to let
them know! First we need an e-mail address to Sega. All of the hog-lovers
out there should try to find it, and tell Sega how much we love Sonic, and
try to convince them to bring Fighting Sonic and Virtual Sonic to America!
These would keep him from dying, and if they become huge hits, they may even
inspire a third season of the show we all love! Maybe even spin-offs! So
support the hedgehogs in need, and write to Sega!

Arggh! Those horrible Telkom (The South African Phone monopoly) chaps
disconnected my phone! .. Anyways.. for now I'm back.. on the DAD170C's
telephonic communications unit, while he is compressing and analysing todays
input - a process called dreaming.

Okay first off, They put *both* the cartoon types into Zulu, for S.A.   So,
add Zulu as another DUBB. (The TV service however, didn't simulcast the
Saturday version in english.)

How nice, they dubbed it into Zulu.

   I don't speak Zulu.

Okay, now what else?   Sonic being phased out?    Hmm.. I doubt it, rather
our blue pal seems to be be plaining out. So to speak, SEGA are probably
just letting Sonic fade and become the equiv of the nintendo 'Ninja 37' (or
whatever number it did get up to) 

The micro-machine advert? Nope, I live in Africa.. the place of the stupidly
high phone rates, wasted TV, and.. Oh, I did see some elephants. :P


Now.. On to some original material..     My good pal Ice-Blade, took me to
meet some guy he knows who owns a comic store. Well, he was a really nice
english chap, but that really has no relevance.. anyways.. Jeff managed to
get me one of the Sonic comics from Archie.. (No #18) Okay, so it was the
January edition.. but what the hell.. who can really complain, poor Jeff
only has half a brain.. Dough.. off topic again.

Anyways.. the first story .. well.. sucked. Okay, let me be fair.. From my
perspective it sucked.. There were a few pretty good humour pieces though..
Well, I guess that it was a matter of taste.

Darn.. I'm wondering off again.. [Coffie Sabotage I tell you!] But, I looked
at the art, some of the pictures are sadly wasted... I have attributed these
to when facial expression occurs.  Okay.. looking again, the Manak dude
draws them screaming nicely.. but when they smile.. AGH.. They get that
"Casper the friendly ghost" type look. :( 

The 2nd story, pencilled by Art Mawhinney, was actually pretty danged
impressive.. 

But just wait a moment. #2 could have had a slightly deeper stoyline..
"Ceremonial Acorn?" Why not some sort of crazy key, or thingemabob?  Okay, I
mean sure, Sal's last name is Acorn.. but.. um.. well..   Well.. you kinda
get the idea... 

Oh well, I have now decided that i will make a Digital Comic Format in 1997,
and start my own comic (Freeware.. of course) Perhaps I might change my mind
later dis year.. but we'll see-see.

Oh yes, just to drop a cow of though quick, <Cow Launched! :P>  Twisted
Mettle is coming on.. No, the Uzi-team of Sega hasn't visited me yet.. :P
And, I haven't quit either.. Actually, just 1/2 an hour ago, I was working
on 'Something wonderfull" for it..   Hmm... I'll see about making a nifty
little demo for you chaps sometime.. :) I already have a sorta-working
system, but it suffers some.. well.. instabilities. 

Anyways.. Jeff will be acquiring some more comics for me.. I'll haveta
compliment the Art Mawhinney chap.. his drawing style has been processed and
uploaded to OrganicRAM for later usage. Or in simpler terms, "Me Simon, look
conic, draw like comic."

Cheerio! And never forget.. "Cows are the root of all comedy."

Hmmmm, ever think of having Other Sonics- The Cyborg. Kind of a 'what if'
story. Y'know, Sonic gets partially turned into a robot like Bunnie did.

Fear not!  Sega knows that Sonic fandom is large and in-charge!  We are 
planning many good things for Sonic this year... After all, this is Sonic's 
5th anniversary!  Yes, indeed... The first Genesis game was shipped way back 
in '91.  (Can you believe it?  What a long time ago that seems.)

I can't say as yet what is being planned, but I have a feeling that Sonic 
fans will not be disappointed.  :)

As for the other mascots---you can never have too many mascots (look at 
Disney!), but don't worry, we are not trying to replace the blue-guy.  Not 
by any means.

I beleive that you are sadly mistaken!  There are TONZ of people that are 
still "Sonic fans", so to speak.... I am one of them.  And even if only 
ONE person still enjoys STH, that still means he exsists.... see my 
point?  Well, anyhow, all you Sonic "freaks" <looks at self & grins> I've 
got a surprise in store for you.  AdvisE?  Keep checking my web page & 
you will soon see... later all!

        You can get an E-mail address at the Sega section.

        Littel sugestion, Wouldn't it be cool if Sega made a game based on
the REAL adventures (the cartoon and comic)! You could play as one of the
Freedom fighters! Including REAL places, Knothole, Robotropiles,etc.. It
might help Sonic out a bit too.

        I think if we want to dicuess something(s) we should choose a chat
room to go to for faster disscuesions. I always go to the Sega room (1) but
thats for everone to discuess. Heck maybe even make a Sonic chat room!

Yeah, what if they made a Sierra-style adventure game based on this, for the
pc. When you get into a fight, it could go into Fighting Sonic perspective... 
Aw well, I'd be satisfied if any Sonic game made it to the pc.

Not to jump off topic, but such a game is in the works!  Remember T.

You need a program to access Intenet Chat. mIRC is one of the best, if not
THE best program to do this. Look for it on the WWW. Use the Yahoo or Lycos
search engines. The URL's for these are http://www.yahoo.com and
http://www.lycos.com respectively. Maybe we could all get together for a
Sonic chat session sometime...
Just an idea. See ya!

Actually, it doesn't matter which brand PC you buy, as they will all run the
same software (unless it's a MAC). So if you buy a game for a PC, chances are
the only changes you'll require is a possible memory upgrade. Or if it plays
on WIndows instead of DOS. 

However, with gaming systems, you have the Genesis, the Sega CD, Game Gear,
32X , Saturn, Super NES, Game Boy, Lynx, 3DO, Sony Playstation, and many
 others that I can't think of 'cause I'm too busy to follow them all to
choose from. You pick a system because you like the games, then a new system
comes out and you have to make a choice because neither system's games are
compatible with each other. On top of that, there's the accessories that are
available for each system, plus buying or renting the games. So gaming is not
a cheap proposition by any stretch of the imagination. 

Kiken then goes on:
>The average age of a US Genesis

college students like myself. Those with lots of money to burn. But 
again, its SOA's white-coats who think we want games like Corpse Killer, 
instead of our "childish" Sonic games. This is where the problem comes in.<

I don't know where you get your information regarding the average age of a
video game consumer, but I'm speaking from first hand knowledge both as a
parent and someone who used to work in retail selling video game systems that
the average purchaser was more often than not a parent who bought a system
for their kids whether they were in grade school or college. Were college
kids the biggest customers? No way. High school kids and younger with their
parents far outnumbered college kids when a new game was released on sale,
whether it was SONIC 3 or MORTAL KOMBAT or NHL HOCKEY.

When you say average age, you have to account for people under and over the
average and that's where you get the number from. The amount of people in
their 30's buying for their kids 10 and under far exceeds those 19 - 23 in
college who are into video games. And if you were to check with any licensee
of SONIC products such as sneakers, comics, cartoon series, t-shirts, books,
toys and so on, they would tell you that there's more money to be made from
parents buying for their kids than from college students. This is not meant
as a knock on college students. This is a business fact. That's why you see
McDonald's renovating their restaurants with those jungle gyms, in order to
get the families in to spend more with them. You think TV would worry about
getting it's act together if they didn't have to? 

Enjoy the blue-critter and playing the games and reading the books. We who
produce the work don't think we're doing anything "childish". What we do is
try to produce something that appeals to everyone, something that's extremely
difficult to do. It's much easier to write a story is you have a specific
audience that you aim for. If I wrote for just college students, my stories
would be wildly different. Instead, I have to think more in trying to get
across something the kids will think is funny while the adults are catching
on to the stuff between the lines.

Believe me, from my vantage point working on Archie's SONIC series, I'm
convinced SEGA has a strong interest in keeping SONIC at the forefront with
SEGA customers. If SONIC'S star fades, it won't be because they didn't
promote him.

Why would we use an AOL chat room when we have IRC, which is available to

2. my address is rat@rat.org

3. You're the list owner, so you should know damn well how to

-> Just an idea. See ya!
Actuly last summer I tryed to have something like that in IRC/ But it
was a big dud. Mosty I thought so because of time zone problems. with
people around the world.  Another problem is I later found the some
people got the wrong IRC network. It was on efnet but some people tryed
Undernet as others tryed Dalnet. It was a mess.  If you do have one it
whould be a good idea for you to hold a #sonic channel I whould have to
say try Dalnet (irc.dal.net) then you can have the channel reseved for
certon people to be Ops. and there are lest Splits on dalnet.

Anyway back to the subject. yea I think if we could set up a Bot to
monitor the channel you could have a 24 hour #sonic chat channel.

Hello Sonic Mailing Listers
I am 11 years old.  I really, REALLY hated it when Sonic was taken off the
air.  I am Irish, so Sonic would have been taken off at an earlier or later
date.  Either way, I'm sure all of us were sad when it finished. Could
someone write a FULL story, not just a short one like at rat.org.

Wanna bet?
Sonic is far from dead, granted, he isn't being toated like he used to be..
Sonic recently made an appearance in Bug!(accounting for its popularity? ;) )..
And Sega is making both V-Sonic and Fighting Sonic..
But still, we need to show Sega that the Sonic Universe is the best ascots
you could ever have( I mean..Rinstar? HA!(OOC:Didn't Rinstar look a little
like a chopped up Super Sonic?))..

The Sonic Universe will not die, as long as we don't lat it. Later..

 He will never die. Tails, Knuckles, etc. will NEVER die unless all people
on Earth lose complete faith in The Spiky Warrior. And with this great list,
the only thing that our  Hedge-hero has to worry about is Robotnik, people
who mock him, and people who think he exists only in old Nostalgia Items.

Rob, there are almost 50 different stories on rat.org. Go to Bookshire's
page at http://rat.org/sonic/stories and I'm sure you'll find that some of
the fan fiction there will please you. I don't know which story you read,
but most of them are not short at all. A couple are more than 100 pages
long. Happy reading!

Make that 00.2%!
My introduction to Sonic began with his and Tails' Adventures.
The slapstick humour in the series and the jagged Mobian graphic
design really appealed to me.  I also like robots with character
(even if their AI is at the 4-year-old level), something Swatbots
just don't have.  There is lots of more subtle humour too, like in
some occasional characters' names, like 'Spelunk' or 'Hodge-Podge'.

Sega still uses Sonic in their promotional literature; the leaflet
announcing the Sega Channel here recently has Sonic peeking at you
from the corner of the front page.

No, there was no such show, so you haven't missed anything. That was a
reference to "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog", which starred Sonic and
Tails as the leading cast. Tails does have adventures of his own (even a
three issue mini-series) in the Archie comics, however.

I was told before I joined the list that most of the members liked Tails
best. As for myself, I'm a true blue hedgehog fanatic.

 Hmmm, that could be interesting. 
 Sonic: All right Robuttnik! (Tim Allen grunts.)
Would this movie be based on the cartoon series (if so which one) or the
video games?

Hmm.. New to the net, are we?
Netscape chat is just a LAME interface to IRC. Since Netscape chat is 
only out for Windows, i'd suggest getting mirc.

I would think IRC is the best way to go for unmoderated public chat.  Though
less powerful than MUCKs, it would be easier for most people to get into. 

This is something that needs someone to manage this, as in setting up a time
that we can meet, picking the channel name, and generally organizing the
whole thing. And I sure as heck don't have time. But I do want to see it 
happen. So I've got all the resources, except time. :-(

But I can help anyone who wants to manage this.

I could setup:

- an IRC bot to manage it (trust me, these are awesome)
- a mailing list just for this, that people can use to coordinate with 
  each other about when to meet
- a web page about the channel people can get for information, like:
--- who is currently in the channel (chat room)
--- how to get into IRC
--- information about people who show up regularly.

If interested, mail me directly at rat@rat.org

Well, if you guys really want to know what's up, why don't you ask
the Sega guy?  He's sitting right on this list.  Sure, he's not 
really that chatty, being a propaganda outlet and all ( ;) ), 
but they'd probably be able to give a "yes" or "nein" answer
about such a project.  Right?

All I know is that if they don't get that Urkel guy to do the voice for
Sonic, or don't get a reasonable facimile, I'll self-decapitate.  I
can't STAND Tim Allen....but Jack Nicholsen (sp?) would be freaking
COOL as Robotnik.

(I seriously doubt it'll be live-action.)

Kyle, those are called signatures. It's a feature built into most mail
programs that automatically stamps it at the end of every message that you
send. You can put anything that you want into a sig, including E-mail
address, Home Page location, "I like this, I don't like that...", The Sonic
the Hedgehog Code (Go to http://rgfn.epcc.edu/users/ab360/tails.html on the
World Wide Web for more info. It's the Tails Home Page!), little ascii
pictures, whatever. Have fun with it and make sure it represents who you
are. I'm still designing mine, along with my Home Page...

I would like the old voice's to be in the movie.  Will Wiltin or how ever
you spell it as Sonic.  A first I thought Sonic had a trouble breathing thew
his nose when I first heard his voice.  But now it just won't be the same if
some one else did it.

The Sonic list is not a signature development committee.

Normal .signature usage is fine, as is posting ASCII pics of Sonic 
characters (or even the Sonic or Sega logos).

There are Usenet groups and BBS echo's that support the discussion and 
posting of ASCII pictures.  Please use these resources for development of 
ASCII pics not related to Sonic.

If you need help setting up a .signature, please refer to the 
documentation for your mail program and/or the Signature FAQ.  You should 
be able to find the Signature FAQ in the news.answers newsgroup.

If you have any further questions concerning this subject, please e-mail 
me directly (not to the list).

I would be great if there could be the original voices in a Sonic movie
(well, for the good guys anyway). Tim Alen an Sonic?!?!?!?! You've GOT to

It ain't easy.

The best place to find the drawings (called ASCII art) is in
alt.rec.arts.ascii -- hang out in that group long enough and you'll find
just about anything.  Or you can request others to post drawings they
may know about; that's how I obtained Han J. Lee's ASCII drawing of the
blue blur, which appears in the Sonic FAQ File.

Once I got a copy, though, I had to manually reconstruct it for my own
(giving credit, of course).  Kinda tedious, but worth it.

I'm sure someone more adept at file transfers knows a better way.

One of the Sonic-Grams (Sonic comic #19) hinted at a film in the works,
but there's been no word on it since.  Just as well -- if anyone
remembers what a disaster "Howard the Duck" turned out to be, or even
the Mario Bros. movie, you know how these things can go very wrong.

Tim Allen?  Hard to see him having a role.  The part of Sonic
(voicewise) pretty much belongs to Jaleel White, and even though the
part is pretty generic, I've gotten used to William Windom as Uncle
Chuck.

But dream on.  Anything can happen...especially if there's a Beevis &
Butthead movie in the works!

Here's my vote.

2. Tails
3. Tails
4. Sally (female AND computer literate! woo hoo!)
5. Bunnie
6. Sonic (when he's not being obnoxious)

According to Ken Penders at Archie Comics, the Sally miniseries was an
attempt at testing the waters for spinning Sally off in terms of games
and merchandise.  However, sales were disappointing because a)
distribution was poor, and b) there was a reluctance on the part of the
core audience of boys to get into what was perceived to be a girls'
comic.  It's been suggested before that Bunnie (increased strength
through robotics) and Sally (enhanced agility, access to Nicole) would
make great game characters, but I'm afraid that the preadolescent gender
thing will continue getting in the way.

And now for something completely mushy:

I HAVE to get in on this discussion, Simon, if only because Sonic #18
was what prompted me to start buying the comics.

I've never been a fan of Manak's artwork and have savaged it on several
occasions when reviewing comics for the FAQ File.  The only decent part
of the story for me was the twist about the nature of the wedding.

I was able to enjoy it on another level: as a nice, neat solution to one
of the running bits on the old "Kung Fu" television series.  But I was
even more impressed by the way Kanterovich and Penders handled the death
of Sally's old mentor, Julayla.  Ken Penders actually posted to this
group to let us know that he ran this development past several mothers
he knew to determine if it was inappropriately heavy.

Still, that's what tipped it in for me.  In a way, Julayla's death
helped me to think up my first effort at fanfic: "Bloodlines."

Mawhinney is a strong Sonic artist, but let me run two words past you:
Pat Spaziante.  He's doing the Sonic covers on a regular basis, and his
artwork for issue #25 (Sonic v. Mecha-Sonic) is guaranteed to knock your
socks off.  His cover of #29 is also a major stunner.

Just my US$.02.

Listen up 'Mighty' (Mouse)
I hope that this isn't some rumour, for your sake.
You should be roboricized if it is, 'cause I hate , I REALLY hate it when 
someone gets my hopes up and they let me down.  Hey, did ya hear about the 
new Sonic Film starring Tim Allen and Jack Nicholson?  The story is, Robotnik
comes back, with help from Sonic!!!!  Snively is killed by them both, but
'Botnik
captures Sonic, and after finding out the location of Knothole, he destroyes it.
In the end, 'Botnik is killed and Sally is fatally injured (in other words, 
KILLED!!!!!).

Dear Paul,
It's me again, Robert Shiels.
Thanks for the example of what you are doing.
Are you going to be selling the finished item or are you going to put it up on 
the net?

>From Robert

P.S. Need any help?

I have no idea why I left the subject as 'Re: Catch up..' in that
previous post.

I guess I wanted to reply to Dan Drazen's comments about Archie artist,

I've heard hints on this list before about an existing movie script which
apparently has been put on hold indefinitly ... if this news is recent
enough (where did it come from anyway?) then 'indefinitly' finally
arrived.  [I'll have to check Sonic #19 for that hint about the movie... I
must've missed that]

I also heard Disney had a contract with Pixar to make 3 100% computer
animated movies... Toy Story being the first.  The second supposedly
involes insects.  No word on the third. 

For that third one to be a Sonic movie appears to be 'stretching' it...
Sega would have to make all sorts of deals with Pixar AND Disney.

Sega could however have a separate contract with Pixar (or some completely
different computer animation house). 

That is... assuming it IS computer animated... All the sparce sources I've
heard is that it's going to be live action.  I dont know HOW they're going
to pull THAT off (unless they do something goofy like make the characters
look totally weird by putting people in costumes... or maybe do the 'Roger
Rabbit' thing and mix live action with animation (even computer animation. 
You've all seen those M&M commercials... they're blended with live action
and they look pretty good!). 

Hey... here's a question... if you were casting a live action Sonic movie
[where the actors wear costumes of the characters], who would YOU pick for
different parts? 

I say "Jaleel White" for Sonic... he even looks a bit like our favorite
blue hedgehog and he certainly has moves like him (he also has the
'perfect' voice despite being a bit tall).

No way. Sega would never do something stupid like make Sonic live-action.
But yeah, those M&M commercials are kewl. :-)

I hate to be a pessimist, but this seems too good to be true. A Sonic game,
apparently for the pc, it's free, it's based on the tv show, and it has it's
own mailing list? Seems a bit too perfect to me.

Me too. At first I thought it might be some list-owner just trying to get us
to join his list for the Playstation game, but now I don't think so.

GEE THANKS!!! You just told me the whole story! I'm guessing this will
either be the big finale for the Sonic saga, or just the beginning for a
whole new Sonic series. Hey, anything can happen after the comeback of the
Muppets!

     Really. I bought Princess Sally Numero Uno, and it was good, but I
thought it wasn't intriguing enough to make me wanna read No. 2.

I hate to be an optimist, (and this will be the LASt off-topic post: the 
only reason for it is because I am sick of this project getting torn 
apart, as I have already privately e-mailed the individual who wrote the 
flame below & gave him a piece of my mind,) we have been working long and 
hard on this game.  I personally would know this.  Our love for the Sonic 
cartoon & joy in programming, music making, etc, is what drives us to do 
it.  The sick lust for money is NOT what drives us.  I personaly 
understand that there are many people in this world, driven by the sick 
lust for money-not us.

	Listen, I've seen demos galore, and you can take that for what it 
is.  If you don't like it, we don't have a gun to your head.  Simply 
don't play it when it comes out.  And if you DO change your mind, and 
decide to be a little more open to the fact that we are not idiots and 
can program as well (if not better than) any adult programmers, you can 
join the METTLE mailing list and discuss your problems with the game 
there.  Not here.  That goes for anyone.... I am quite sure Ratman is 
getting sick and tired of postings about crap like ACii drawings, game 
discussions: just stuff people don't want their mail boxes clustered 
with.  So, any other comments, send `em over ("mighty@en.com") and I will 
deal with you personally.  Any game disscussions, take it to mettle.  End 
of story, case closed.  


-Mighty, over and out

PS- flames will not be tollerated....I will not take them lightly, and if 
you keep flaming me (or any friends on this list...) let's just say do 
not take my words lightly.

PPS-Ratman, sorry bout' the off-topic post.  But people have gone too far..

3) Sonic

Favorite Fan-fic:

(You want me to pick ONE of them????? They all rule!)

This is a tie. I think that The Temporal Syndrome and Bloodlines were among
the best.

(before you ask, wrt = "with respect to")

Not to play list-owner or anything, but if you're not going to comment on 
specifically _why_ you rank the characters/stories/whatever in the order 
you do, please consider just sending your reply back to the survey proponent 
instead of cluttering up the list with it.

Thanks.

And just to set an example, here's my favorite character list:

1.  Sally - a scene from the "Batdance" video from the first Batman movie 
    sums it up quite nicely: some fairly well-endowed woman(en?)
    representing Vicky Vale bounces around with a T-shirt on that reads 
    "all this and brains too!"

2.  Bunnie - cute furry plus implied pathos with her condition...

3.  Tails - cute plus enthusiastic (maybe more so in the comic than the 
    show...)

I just saw it today for the first time. Man, what crap...
I bet some people will watch that and say, "this is the Sonic cartoon? 
What garbage!".

But at least Tails is in it, so I think i'll be watching it. :-)

Give me your top 5 characters and mail them to:

vote@rat.org

Do not send it to me or the list. if you do, it will be ignored by me.
After, say a week, I'll tally up the results and post them to the list.

Listed below are suggestions. Only if your chracter is not listed below, then
by all means you can use them. I was trying to put together a complete list,
but that was more of a task than I could handle. There's a lot of one-shot
characters. Like "Cat". Remember him? He got busted very early in the weekend
Sonic. Sonic tried to get him out, but he was too late. 

Anyway, here's a the list.
Check out http://rat.org/pub/sonic/text/faq-jf.txt for an even bigger 
list.

The reason I'm doing this, is I think you might have some favorite 
characters you can't think of right now. May as well have the whole menu 
in front of you before choosing, right?

Actually, "Twisted Metal" does indeed have its own mailing list.  It was

Once again, I'd like to believe this is true, but I'm not going to get my 
hopes up unless I see some hard evidence from an official source (such as 
SEGA or DIC).

Ah well, you heard the Rat. So I guess I might as well throw in the survey
towel, but it was fun while it lasted. The votes are closed, and I'm going
to post the results right here. I got A LOT of response, but the two closest
were Tails and Sonic. 

Here's the way my point system worked: 

3 points if the character was your favorite.
2 points if he/she was your second-favorite
1 point if he/she was your third pick

1. Tails- 35 points (The two-tailed one rules supreme!!!)
2. Sonic- 30 points (The blue warrior comes in a close second.)
3. Sally- 26 points (As one voter said- beautiful AND computer literate!
Woo-hoo!)
4. Bunnie- 14 points (She's an inspiration to all you half-roboticized
people out there...)
5. Knuckles- 13 points (Poor Knuckles. I expected him to at least get in
fourth.)
6. Antoine- 4 points (This proves that even the lowliest are respected in
the hearts of Sonic fans.)
7. Mecha Sonic- 3 points (Come'on. I mean, am I only one who likes this guy?)
8. Espio- 1 point (See above comment.)
9. St John- 1 point (I don't know who he is either, some skunk dude.)
10. Dulcey- 1 point (Too bad the series was canceled before she got a chance
to work on her landings.)
11. Rotor- 0 points (Fat, purple dudes get no respect!:<)
12. Uncle Chuck- 0 points (Blue robot supreme.)
13. Bill Clinton- 0 points (Probably the same he's going to get in his next
election.)

I sorta agree.
This kind of opens the door for discussion, and people just saying, 
"here's who I like" doesn't do that.

Someone voted for Rotor, and put in a comment, "before they turned him into a
blob". I have to agree. The 2nd season Rotor is just lame.
So my personal vote didn't include Rotor because of this.
So people can put something saying which rotor if they want. Don't let 
the 2nd season ruin Rotor's image! :-)

p.s. Got 7 votes so far. Keem em coming! Who's you're favorite 5?

     (If Lovelace can anthropomorphise a planet why can't I? :)
 1.  Sally (see Rat's #4)
 1.5 Robotnik (the believibly sinister StH characterisation)
 2.  Tails (my favourite outside of StH)
 3.  Bunnie (Why does everyone think robotisation is a bad thing?? :)
     I really would have liked seeing her and the other secondary
     characters being more involved in StH. Bunnie's Soothern accent
     is a liability though..[1])
 4.  Ant ("Hooked on Sonics")
 5.  Sonic (sometimes I can dig that wisearse attitude :)

[1] Get Sigorney Weaver to voice Bunnie in the movie. :)

of you want to use Kain in your future stories and develop him, you have my
OK, but one request: Let me know about it before ya go and put the story up.
If you wish to talk about this more, just e-mail me and spare putting those

I would like to talk about the coolest Freedomm Fighter in all of Knothole.
 Tails!!!!!!!!  That is right, I think he kicks ASS, because first of all, he
can problobly beat Antonie in a fight.  If he ever fell off a cliff, he can
just fly back up using his 2 tail's.  His personality is cool just like a 10
year old.  (Sometimes, I think "Aunt Sally" babys him too much!).  I think if
they had those 15 minute episodes they had with Antonie which were "Trouble
with Antonie/ Ghost Busted" and "The Odd Couple/ Rob-ecca", should have Tails
in them.  That way, you can really find out what Tails is really like.  In
conclusion, Ithink TAILS KICKS MAJOR ASS!

Oh, for crying out loud!! :P

I can NOT imagine a live action SONIC movie as a decent project.  This isn't
something that can translate well into live action.

Secondly, I *REALLY* REALLY cannot see Sonic being played by Tim Allen in
any way shape or form even as just a VOICE! :P  That's HORRIBLE casting.

Robotnik being played by Mr.Joker just wouldn't be very good either--again,
a horrible case of miscasting... he would be wrong for the character in
EVERY way... I'm sure even HE would agree with that and I'm sure he'd turn
down the role too.

I summarily think that Sonic would make a FANTASTIC animated feature film..
but as a live action--I could see Robotnik played by a human... and some of
the characters... but MOST, including Sonic, just wouldn't be suitable in a
live action film.

No way.

You've GOT to be kidding me. You did NOT just splurgh out the whole plot of
the movie to the list.And if you did, Nice job. Be a LITTLE bit more

Kiken here, I thought that someof those on the list might find this 
interesting:

Recently in Japan, Sonic The Hedgehog Anime Volume 1 was released.
Its being done by the same team of animators who did the opening and 
endings to Mega CD Sonic (Sonic CD), so if you liked that style, you'll 
love this.

The story for the first episode goes something like this:

The President (of what and where I know not) gets kidnapped by Eggman 
(Robotnik) and is taken away to Eggworld. Sonic and Tails team up with 
the President's daughter in order to save him. They venture to Eggworld, 
which looks like a cross between post-appocolyptic Neo-Tokyo and Cyber 
City Oedo 2808, very strange but very cool. They battle a bunch of what I 
guess you could call the Japanese equivalents of SWATBOTS, then do battle 
with some huge mechanized beast. After defeating that, they meet Knuckles 
(who wears one of those Australian outback hats with the folded side, and 
carries a knapsack over one shoulder), and thats the end of the first 
episode. While it may not sound like much the shots of it that I have 
seen look amazing, plus its an OVA, so the artists have been given quite 
an extensive budget.

SOJ have not said how many more parts will comprise the series, chances 
are though based on previous OVA releases that the series will be 4 
episodes in length.

Looking at the story you might have noticed something wierd, half the 
characters in this anime are human. So the Japanese give us a world 
where, for the most part, anthropomorphic animals and humans live harmony 
with each other. Different.

Now here comes the downer, the anime is rental-only. That blows! Luckily 
I mangaed to strike a deal, and I've put a copy down on special order, 
but its gonna cost me an arm and a leg, oh well. Till then, I've got 
these nice screen grabs to look at. Once I get the anime, I'll make some 
jpg's from it and post them on my page.

Kiken signing off.

        Hey I didn't say a live action movie! I meant voices of coarse!! As
for Tim Allen, I'm not really sure. I don't know what to say for that. I
watch home&improvment (no were near as much as I  WOULD like to watch
Sonic). I don't know who that guy thats a post to play Robotnick but whoever
plays him now is just fine.

Hey hey chaps,

Okay, well I'm (attempting to) write another StH story, this time however,
it's all the main characters.. only difference being the plot. Well, you'll
have to trust me here, the plot of this one is something that makes me shiver! 

There are a few things I was pondering about Mobius though..

1) Three moons? Right?
2) How long is a Mobian Day? 
3) How long is a Mobian Year?
4) What is Mobius's Gravity? (10/m.s I'd assume)
5) In what Solar System is Mobius?
6) What Planet is Mobius from the sun?
7) How many planets in Mobius's system?

It's probable I'll be contradicting all these.. but I'd like to compare all
the same.. :)

Well, 
        Cheerio.

Why is everybody assuming that Tim Allen and Jack Nicholson will play
Robotnik and Sonic? What about the other characters? Tim Allen would
probably make a good Rotor. ("Ugh, ugh, ugh. Hey Sonic, I just pumped your
sneakers for MORE POWER! Ugh, ugh, ugh." Sonic goes out, tries out the
sneakers, and "AAAAAGGGGHHH!")
Jack Nicholson, well, I don't know where he would fit, maybe Robotnik, Uncle
Chuck? I don't know, I haven't seen too many of his movies. 

And I'm still hoping that Metal Sonic and the Chaotix Crew will finally come
into the picture.

   Hi all!
     A couple of nights ago I had a weird dream. It was a dream about a
Sonic puppet show! I think someone should come up with this kind of show! In
my dream, it was sort of a mix of the weekday and weekend Sonic. Maybe
mixing the shows together could make BOTH shows better.

                                                                   Later,

As requested by a few people, I've converted and posted the "good" ending to
Sonic CD in AVI format. It's 4 minutes long, so the file is a bit on the big

I'm writing a fanfic and I need to ask a few questions about Sally:

     1. What exactly is she (fox, squirrel, what?)?

     2. How old is she supposed to be?

     3. If anyone knows, what year was she born in?

The fanfic I'm writing isn't about her, but I need some information for...well... you'll see. :-)

I agree! Uh, not about the puppet show, but about combining the two shows to
make them better. The weekend Sonic just wasn't funny enough, and the
weekday Sonic was just demented. (personal opinion, you Sonic weekday lovers
don't have to get on my back.) Maybe the weekend Sonic, but with more of the
humor from the weekday Sonic. Just not too much of it.

He's cool, and if they did something like 'reprogramed him for good' in one
of the games, he'd make a great character!!
But it'd have to be either Sonic CD or Knuckles Chaotix Mecha..the ones on
the Genesis are always too big and clunky..

    Well, my friend, his name is "Mecha-Sonic". Metal Sonic is the Sonic
Robot that is in "Sonic and Knuckles" when you are Knuckles. YES!
Mecha-Sonic is cool, but I have him on my Fav Villains list. For surveys and
such on this Mail List, I do my Hero List.

She's a squirrel I think, it was mentioned in Archie comics.PLus the Acorn
bit of her name hints it.

16. when Sally tried to access files from Nicole,she said that Sally "was 2
years away" from being,I forget the termiage, let's say 'fully-grown'..so
that make Sally 16.

I caught a advertisement on tv this morning for Hot Wheels "Crash and Smash"
motorcycles, one of which feature my favoriate little blue dude.

I happened to be recording at the time, so I was able to grab frame of it. I
posted it to rat.org as "sonictoy.jpg", so it should be available as soon as
Rat moves it.

Mecha Sonic is the one from Sonic 2 and Sonic & Knuckles. I'm talking about
the cool one, from Sonic CD and Knuckles Chaotix, who's name is Metal Sonic.
They changed his name to Mecha when they transferred him into the comics.

It's "k". An echidna is a Spiny Anteater.

Well, an echidna (Pronounced e_KID_na) is also known as a spiny anteater.
It's an egg-laying mammal found in Australia, about 12 to 18 inches in
length. So, yes, it does actually exist. (And, no, they are not red.) :)

It was said a while back on the list something about sega was releasing
a Sonic CD game for the PC. That was a long time ago I don't remember
the exact details. I asked around a bit again recently and noone at the
stores seems to know anything about it. Does anyone have any further
information about this?

thanks.

(trying to keep with the list's fandom theme, Mighty answers hastily...)
There was a game.  It was released for the PC, but I don't think it was
SUPPOSED TO be released, (or at least not in the USA).  It is a replica of
Sonic CD-complete with animations, and even MORE bonus stuff than the
orrigional!  YOu will, however, not be able to BUY this title, (as it
doesn't officially "exsisT",) HOWEVER after a few MONTHS (literally)
searching some "special" FTP sites, I was able to uncover it-all 17 disks of
it.  An excellent game, but unfortunately, the way SOA programs, you need an
INTEL Pentium 66Mhz or BETTER with 8MB of RAM to run it.  So, have fun with
that one!  :)  Anyways, if anyone is interested in this game personally,
e-mail me.  Keep in mind the system specifications, or don't bother
e-mailing me, cuz it won't run.  Say I had a DX4 and thought I'd be cute and
DL it?  Uh-huh... it's not that it runs SLOW or takes a while to LOAD, it
just plain ol' WON'T RUN. :)  Well, anyhow, to answer the question, other
than all the bonus stuff, it's a replica of SONIC CD.  And all the cool
aVI's come with it, crystal clear, full screen, and SMALL in size. =20

Welp, that's it folks!=20

Oh, to keep the "on-topic" aspect someone a while ago asked what Sally was?
I always thought she was a mix between a ground squirel and a fox.  (I guess
her parents were different... we never saw her Mom, but her Dad had a huge
fully tail!)

And another thing: I saw that hot wheel commercial-how N*E*R*D*Y!  A little
plastic Sonic vs. A street shark, (or whatever the heck they're
called)-NERDY!  <Sonic would, of course win>

And with this Sonic movie-I talked to an inside source inside of Sega, (I
shall not reveal this source because I realize there is a Sega guy on this
list who could, in essense, be this guy's boss, sorry!! :)) and my source
said this game is going to definately be an animation, and the soundtrack
will be very new-aged and the theme will be somewhat adult based!  I don't
see how they're going to get away with this... Robotnik pulls out a laser
gun and Pearl Jam starts singing Glorified G?!?  Who knows with Sega...
anything's possible.  More info on this as I get it! =20

In regards to Sonic PC game: (do not read this-it is off topic)=20

        Many of you have e-mailed me about this rare piece.  There are too
many of you to upload it individually, and I surely cannot send it via US
mail.  So, Ratman (being the kind gent he is,) has agreed to let me upload
it to his site.  Let it be known!  Any crap from Sega, it goes down.  We
have agreed on this.  It is not "illegal" in that it was never officially
released.  Well, anyhow, it should be there by Monday.  I'll upload a few
disks tonight, tomarrow, etc. =20

ONE MORE TIME:

Sonic CD for PC

requirements:

Windoze `95
at LEAST 8 MB RAM (12-16 reccomended)
>INTEL< Pentium, 66Mhz or more, (why the hell it doesn't work on my Cyrix
120, I don't                                 know...)
SVGA graphix
Sblaster/compat.
joystick reccommended.

REMEMBER: it is 17 disks UNINSTALLED.  This would measure out to be anywhere
from 30-50 MB installed.  (But it's worth it, trust me, I have the Sega CD
version).  There is also a fix so it works without a CD.  It's called
SONICFIX.ZIP.  NOTE: you NEED SONICFIX.ZIP FOR THIS FILE TO WORK!  Without
it, it's useless.  Well, enjoy.

(I'll post install instructions when I upload the whole game... I'll get a
few disks in now...)

There was some talk on the list about how many readers (me being one of
them) wished that the comics had more space in which characters could be
given more personality, like the TMNT comics. If the market can't support 2
Sonic comics, and stories have to be contained within one comic, why not
make the one comic larger, say 48 pages minimum for the main story?

> There are a few things I was pondering about Mobius though..

> 1) Three moons? Right?

In one "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" episode, one character 
(I think it was Robotnik) refers to the "Twin moons of Mobius".
Didn't name them, though.

> 2) How long is a Mobian Day? 
> 3) How long is a Mobian Year?
> 4) What is Mobius's Gravity? (10/m.s I'd assume)

Comparable to Earth's.  Although it might be fun to play with these,
I.e. have a plot where Robotnik changes these parameters.

> 5) In what Solar System is Mobius?

Why, the Mobian system.  In any case, the Mobian population wouldn't
have the same names for stars as the Earth people.  They would refer
to the star that Mobius orbits simply as "the sun".  But it's not
Earth's sun, Sol.

> 6) What Planet is Mobius from the sun?

Arbitrary.  If the Mobian sun is of approx. equal size and brightness
as our sun, then Mobius is approx. 90-100 megamiles from it.

> 7) How many planets in Mobius's system?

There are more being discovered every year.  Maybe some artificial
ones, too.

Nah, you can't contra-dict what hasn't been dicted yet.
Or do I mean DiC-ed?  :-)

See ya!  Keep on ablating (or whatever you do best)!

I'm writing a Sonic fanfic, and I was wondering if anybody would be
interested in drawing a couple of pictures for it.

Issue #35 of the Sonic comic from Archie has to be the WORST issue I've 
read in quite some time! This *definitely* felt like it belonged on the 
daily StH cartoon, not to mention a measure of implausability, especially 
WRT the number of rings... In order for Sonic to have that many by 15 or 
so would be on the order of several hundred to over a thousand *per second*!

And the Knuckles backup story? Don't ask!

This issue is a travesty, IMO, and a waste of $1.50...

I prefer the ones closer to the SatAM StH series, or of the calibre of 
the Princess Sally miniseries, or of issues between #23 (where I came in) 
and #32.... The creative team that makes the comics have demonstrated on 
a number of occaisions where they've put together quality comics- This is 
not one of them!

This wasn't going to be THIS long of a review- I just finished reading 
this... :P

Pass the Pepto, please.... *urp!*

To all of you on the Sonic mailing list, 


The most famous hedgehog is baccccck!  This is Bryant Melesko returning 
to the list after a long absence.  I thought I would re-subscribe after I 
noticed I stopped getting SonicList mail.  I welcome again artwork 
requests and I recently captured about a megabyte worth of Sonic 
snapshots from the weekday cartoon.  I heard also that they decided to 
continue the Sat AM cartoons, is this true?  Just checking into the 
rumors to see if they're vaporware or not?

						Sonic-FULLY Yours,

If you thought 35 was so bad, maybe you should go back and read 33. IMO, it
actually makes the new issue look decent by comparison.  There are 2 things
which will always ruin a STH comic: 1. Archie decides to gear the story
towards the younger part of the audience, or 2. Manak's artwork.  What can
you expect when both occur in the same issue?

Haven't gotten a vote since last Wednesday, so I think all the votes are in. 

Sonic is the winner of the voting!

Here are the vote results. I wasn't sure how to analyze them, so
here are what people voted:

If you give them all equal weight, they come out like this:

  13 sonic
  10 tails
  10 sally
  10 bunnie
   4 rotor
   4 knuckles
   3 antione
   2 robotnik
   2 mechasonic
   2 geoffery
   2 chuck
   1 vector
   1 snively
   1 scratch
   1 nicole
   1 espio
   1 dulcy

But if you give more weight to #1, like so:

#1 gets 3 point
#2 gets 2 point
#3 #4 and #5 gets 1 point

it comes out like this:

  24 sonic
  21 sally
  18 tails
  14 bunnie
   7 knuckles
   6 mechasonic
   4 rotor
   4 antione
   2 robotnik
   2 geoffery
   2 chuck
   1 vector
   1 snively
   1 scratch
   1 nicole
   1 espio
   1 dulcy

But no matter how you extrapolate it, I think Sonic is the winner. Though 13
isn't a big enough population to make any conclusions. It was just a fun
experement.

..consider me in the minority those people who like Manak's work.. 
I dig the empathsised line work, and he also draws _consistently_
and at least gives the impression of being a professional artist!
No weird looking mouths! No akward postures! The characters look
themselves panel after panel! Nothing that looks like it came from a
cheap dojinshi! (unlike some of the new talent employed by Archie..)

(He also draws Sally proportioned to 3.5-4 heads high, unlike the
(really ridiculos) 3 heads..  :P)

Kevin -

Right now the comics market overall is in a delicate situation. On one hand,
Archie Comics is probably very tempted to have a second SONIC book, as it's a
great seller. However, because they don't want to dillute the market with too
much product, they opt to do specials and mini-series. For example, if the
KNUCKLES mini-series does as well as everyone hopes, chances are very good
everyone's favorite echidna will graduate to his own series. In that case,
you might see KNUCKLES specials alternate with SONIC specials then. But you
probably wouldn't see more SONIC.

In fact, many comics buyers are complaining already they have too many
different books to buy just to follow one character. Have you tried following
Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, the X-Men, Star Trek or Elfquest lately? (to
name but a few series) There are so many books every month featuring these
characters that by collecting one, a lot of people don't have the budget for
anything else. 

Another area of concern is the cover price on comics. Already there is
starting to be resistance on the buyer's part once books hit the $2.00 mark.
Most parents are reluctant to shell out anything more than that to buy a
comic for their child, not when the child asks for toys and video games as
well.

There's a lot of factors, but this covers the main ones. I hope this
clarifies matters.

To D.M. -

You're entitled to your opinion about SONIC #35. But I think it would be more
informative and helpful if you explained what is was you didn't like about
either story. "As for Knuckles, don't ask!" Why not? What are we to gather
from this comment? A negative connotation, yes. But why? The story doesn't
hold up? Something doesn't fit your version of the SONIC/KNUCKLES mythos?
What? At least when you say something is good or bad, give at least some
indication where you're coming from. Thank you.

Did you think the KNUCKLES story was geared toward a younger readership? When
we turned the script in for #35, we honestly thought we were going to be
asked to tone it down. If anything, things get more intense as the story
progresses. I've seen a make ready proof on KNUCKLES #1, and Art Mawhinney
has turned in a SUPER job. This book moves into high-gear from the first
page.

I normally don't debate reviews on my work, but if Mike and I are going to
take razzies from the readers on this one, we'd at least like to hear your
reasons for dissatisfaction. Thanks.

        Hi,
        My name is Chris Flinn and 1 of my favorite programs on t.v. was
Sonic The Hedgehog.  I can't believe it got canceled!  Just when it was
getting good, too!  Now I'll never get to see what happens!  Do you suppose
that they will ever start the show again?  Why did they cancel it anyway?
Oh, well.  At least the comic book is still out.

Actually, I enjoyed the Knuckles story in issue 35. I've been interested in
the Knuckles stories from the start, mainly because all of you at Archie are
creating a past for Knuckles. Even though Knuckles' character is a couple
years old now, we really know nothing about him. Sega didn't reveal anything
significant in their games and even the fan-fiction authors haven't touched
on this yet. (If one of you has written a story that details Knuckles' past,
I apologize to you. I haven't read it yet.) 
     
I am glad to see the character of Knuckles being developed. This is
something very important, in my opinion. It makes the character in the book
much easier to relate to. It's just like getting to know somebody. It's hard
to be interested in something or someone that you know absolutely nothing
about. I have felt that the character development has been a bit lacking in
the comic, but some of the recent issues have helped to solve this problem.
If the Knuckles mini-series continues this trend, I'll be very interested in
seeing it. Ken, please keep up this kind of development. 

-Matt

Hi, Chris!  Well, if you evr need a Sonic fix, then check out Bookshire's 
homepage.  There's some wayyy past cool fanfics there, featuring new 
characters as well as your old favorites.  Just point your browser to 
http://rat.org, click on "sonic fandom", and then click on "bookshire's 
homepage".  This is where most of the fanfic written by list members 
winds up eventually.

As for why the show got canned, some say it's because it got clobbered in 
the ratings by Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.  See Dan Drazen's Sonic Faq 
(also at http://rat.org) for more information.

there will ever be a Sonic The Hedgehog movie?  I've been waiting a long
time for any reports to say something about a S.T.H.  movie being realeased.
In the comic book they said there will definitely be a Sonic The Hedgehog
movie, but when?

I've gotten Sonic from Miniseries #0 and agree with Archie comics here...
Occasional specials and Miniseries runs have been quite acceptable for me.
I've occasionally feared that Sonic would split into multiple comics.

I'm one of those people... I've just about dropped every Marvel title I 
used to read because of too many spinoffs and parallel series.

There used to be a comic called 'Bizarre Heros' (one of those black and
white alternative comics) (I think it's still around actually).  The
intention of the writer was that instead of having something like comics
with a 'consistant' universe he decided to have a whole bunch of universes
in a single comic.

Hi hi_Z.

Just like people isn't it, I tell Yiffy to get me another Sonic comic,
"nothing below 18 this time Jeff.." (he got 15 last time!) And, what did he
get me? 
Sonic #14!

Okay, so I read #14 (& put up with a certain squirrel having pink fur), and
then I came to one story. (Tails' taste of power) Now, in this story Tails
chomps on some weirdo fruit and becomes Mr SuperGenius (also becomes right
annoying)
He then makes himself a little #1 sigh thingy, because he wants to become
the leader. He claims he's the perfect person to replace Sonic as the leader
of the freedom fighters.

Now the ponder.. it seemed to me that Sally was the leader of the freedom
fighters.. she certainly seems more of a leader than Sonic. (Plotting
missions and generally dominating him - ie telling him what and what not to do) 
        She would also be the more natural choice for a leader since she's
well, a princess and all..

Is this a mod in the way the archie dudes write the comic /c/ to the 'toon?

Ponder it MORTALS! :P
Cheers

I never did see Babe - any good?  The few clips I've seen/heard of it, 
she sounded more like Gosalyn Mallard than Bunnie to me :^)

And not to knock her or Tress, but lately I kind of think Kath Soucie has

        I agree that Sonic comics should not break up into a comic for
everbody. Imange geting 3or4 or even 5 comics a month, and you would have to
pay for each one to! I hope that would never happen. However I do like the
idea of mini-sereis. 

        I also been thinking of another thing, the comics are geting a
littel to riduculess. Like 32,33, and even 35 are WIERD! I hope the next
comeing issues aren't quit like that. Oh, just one last thing, Scott Fulop
(the editer of Sonic's comic of coarse!) is leaving and Freddy Mendez is
takeing his place. I'm saying this just in case you missed No.35

It seems my letter to Ken was misunderstood, I never once said there should
be more than 1 comic, and I quote: "If the market can't support 2 Sonic
comics, and stories have to be contained within one comic, why not make the
one comic larger?", besides,  the idea of two comics was already talked
about on the list.

I agree with Quozl that 1 billion rings is a bit much.  This story seemed a 
bit too strongly based on the games for me.  But the Manak/Koslowski art 
was OK...

Misc. comments:

Page 4:  "oh so"???  I thought only Disney comics (specifically, the Duck 
    	 ones) used that phrase :^)

Other references from other shows: "Big Bird", and "hokey smokes"

The quasi-King James English didn't do much for me, but I suppose it was 
sort of "mandatory" (if not consistent: "thous and yous" were intermixed).

Page 12:  I thought a sideways figure-eight was the symbol for infinity, not 
    	  eternity, but maybe I'm splitting hairs...

Page 13:  The 3rd walker's answer reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode 
    	  where Sherman Helmsley played a mathematician who was stuck on a 
    	  problem and said he'd sell his soul to solve it, and guess who 
    	  showed up?  Yup, and he said he'd let Sherman out of his promise 
    	  if he could give him a task he couldn't do or ask him a question 
    	  he couldn't answer, and would let him ask 3 questions beforehand 
    	  to determine the best task to give him.  Sherman's response: 
    	  "really?"  Devil's answer: "yes, really - that's one!" 
    	  (I'm already off-topic, so I'll stop there...)

Page 14:  But I did like Sonic's conclusion: the best answer to all (well, 
    	  I disagree with that) questions is "this isn't fair!"  I'm sure 
    	  Job would have a thing or two to say about that...

    	  But what's a "triple helix"?  That chain didn't look like a helix 
    	  at all to me...

Page 15:  So now we now what reading material Robotnik gets off on :^)
    	  And nice sound effect when he crashed...

Page 16:  Who gave Sally double irises?  Eww...

About the Knuckles story: I guess I didn't like it _or_ hate it, but I'm 
not a big Knuckles fan in the first place.  I won't call it predictable, 
but the one brother being your basic greedy-for-power type wasn't too 
surprising; I guess I'll reserve final comment until the whole thing's done.

So where's Scott Fulop going to?  Did he burn out on this job, was it time 
to move on, or did something better come along?  Whatever, I wish him well.

In Sonic 36, we'll "witness Sonic and the Freedom Fighters enter the Zone 
of Silence to search for the missing King Acorn!"  Looking forward to that, 
though it already sounds like it won't quite match the show continuity...

New editor Fred Mendez gave a rather political answer (i.e., a non-answer)
to a letter asking "what happened to Sonic the Hedgehog on ABC?": "I was 
too fast for their time slot and Robotnik got his way with the TV people 
but you can catch my other show (yes, there were two) on USA Network."

I didn't spot any familiar names in the list of others who wrote in...

Rather weird Anime/video game-like representation of Sonic and Tails on the 
last page...

Guess that's all for now.

    Well, I LIKED the Knuckles story.  (Nice to see that Robotnik isn't
the only howling mad scientist in the history of Mobius.)  It's getting
pretty intense, there.
    The Sonic lead-in was OK, too (even though I ain't a fan of Manak's
artwork), but the argument about the rings is pretty acurate.  I put it
through a computer, and determined that assuming Sonic is 16, never
sleeps, eats, or anything else-- just grabs rings-- he will have to grab
roughly 47.5 rings every SECOND.  He's fast, but he ain't THAT fast...
**gryn**
    In other words, nice story, bad math.  Oh, well...

I may have misunderstood, and for that I apologize. However, the matter of
economics enters its head here. Archie currently has the lowest comic prices
around company wide, without using outside advertising anywhere except on the
covers. They are fighting tooth and nail to give you the best product for the
lowest cost. By doing so, they figure if you enjoy their books, you'll buy
more. It's that simple.

IMHO, it's DeCesare's way of saying "Just because you're intelligent it
doesn't mean you can't act like a jerk."  The fruit apparently affects
the ego as well as the gray matter.  There was some discussion along
these lines about how obnoxious the young Simba was in the beginning of
"The Lion King," but I digress....  Tails was probably aware of Sally's
rank and leadership role, but the fruit went to his head.  

Not that I mind Tails getting some depth.  There was some development
along these lines in the stories leading up to the Tails miniseries,
mainly along the lines of his resenting being told what to do by the
older Freedom Fighters.  It's a natural enough plot line, but
unfortunately the miniseries totally mishandled it; it never showed
Tails actually having anything like a change of heart.  He was shown
making the quantum jump from obnoxious little brat to realizing that the
others really do care about him.  That's just plain, unforgivable bad
writing.

        Hi Ron,
        My name is Chris Flinn.  I happened to see Babe while watching my
brother.  It's ok....  As for Babe's voice, I thought it sounded familiar,
so I looked at the end credits and saw Christine Cavanaugh, the voice of
Bunnie Rabbot!  Then I looked at one of my Sonic recordings, and saw the
same name.  BINGO!  By the way, doesn't Kath Soucie play Princess Sally?

Kath does indeed voice Princess Sally, where she also did an uncredited
assist as Nicole.  Double-teaming must agree with her, since she also
voices both Phil and Lil on Nickelodeon's "Rugrats," where the character
of Chuckie is voiced by...Christine Cavanaugh!  And where the occasional
character of Susie is voiced by Cree Summer Frank, the voice of Dulcy.

It's possible, but didn't whatever it was growl? I'm not really sure, it's

I always though those were supposed to be Knuckles' eyes.  (you also see
eyes like them on the box for the Sonic 3 game).  

Didn't someone mention on the list long ago that this was confirmed by
asking someone who worked on that show?

It's the symbol for the DNA molecule, the basic building block for all 
life. (But that is suppose to be a DOUBLE-helix, not triple.)

Apparently, that's how Sonic and Tails look in the new Fighting Sonic

But the eyes shown are colored bright red! I don't know of any characters
with these kind of eyes.  When the eyes appear, it sounds to me like
someone is breathing through a gasmask or something to that effect.  I just
assumed it was some machine Snively put together.

What I meant to mention is the comic said it was a triple helix. In RL, 
it is a double helix.

        Why did Scott Fulop stop being editor for Sonic The Hedgehog's
comic?  I really loved his bad jokes and sense of humor.  I sure hope Freddy
does a good job (whitch I'm sure he will, guys) being the new editor of
Sonic The Hedgehog.  Good luck!

Could be true. It would be consistent with some things I've read in the
past. (All fiction, of course. I have no idea what the result would be if an
organism's DNA had more than a double helix, or if some known species
already has this characteristic.) In Archie's ninja turtles comic, a
physician actually analyzed a sample of one of the mutant's DNA and said,
"I'm seeing triple and quadruple helixes." Who knows what would happen?

Hey, guys,
     I was at VIDEO MANIA in the mall today, and I was looking in a GAME =
PRO magazine (not sure what issue, though), and it said that there was =
for sure gonna be a Sonic movie and that...Knuckles?...was going to be =
in it. It had a lot of good details. If you would like to know more =
about it, e-mail me PRIVATELY and I'll tell you what I know.

So is the movie a cartoon?  Will there be the same voices?  Is Snively the
main bad guy  since Robotnick  was killed?  Well, I would like to here about
it!

Scott basically had other things he wanted to do, such as spend more time
writing. It's just one of those things that occur in comics. People are
assigned different projects all the time.

As for Freddy, he's just as great as Scott was to work with. The SONIC book
is in very capable hands with him at the helm. (And no, I'm NOT kissing up to
Freddy. If I didn't think so, I just wouldn't have written this at all. But
both Scott and Freddy are two of the good ones. My dealings with the people
at Archie, in fact, has been a positive experience overall.)

@@@@@@@h, that one doesn't really work for me :^)  But it reminded me that 
this issue had Robotnik trying to smash Sonic with a mace (probably 
something from the games), but doesn't he normally just want to roboticize 
him, not kill him?

        When do you suppose Sonic and Sal are gonna get hitched?  They have
been giving away enough hints from time to time, so I guess it should be
pretty soon in the near future.

        Hi,
        The movie will definitely be a cartoon.  About the same voices?...
I sure hope so, because Sonic would never be the same without Jaleel White
voicing him.  Snively, I'm not sure.  Since it is a movie, it will probably
explain how Mobotropolis turns into ROBOtropolis, and how Robuttnik took
over.  It will have Snively in it, but I'm not sure he will be the main bad guy.

"I'm writing a Sonic fanfict, and I was wondering if anybody would be

I would be interested.  I've got a great drawing arm, ask anybody from 
AOL, but why don't you load up my web page and see for yourself.

Who knows?  Hopefully soon, eh?  I guess it's how the producers want it 
to be. :P

        Hi,
        I have every episode of Sonic recorded.  Even "The Doomsday
Project."  I don't have the equipment, and don't know how to scan it, but I
can tell you EXACTLY what happened.

         Hi, Guys,
        Just in case your wondering, here's EXACTLY what happens at the end
of  "The Doomsday Project." 
        In Knothole, the Freedom Fighters are celebrating the end of
Robotnik and Doomsday (especially Sonic and Sally.)  Meanwhile, in the Great
Unknown, an elevater pops up.  As the door opens, Snively, dressed like a
REAL bad guy, steps out.  "Yeeesss!  Ha! Ha! Ha!  The big round guy finally
let Sonic defeat him!  Well don't celebrate too soon, hedgehog!  Now, it's
my turn!  Ha! Ha!  And I'm not alone!"  As Snively steps away, a pair of
glowing red eyes, appear in the darkness, like the outline of Sonics' eyes.
There is heavy breathing (like the sound when the pilots on the movie "Top
Gun," breathe through their oxygen masks.)

        -Chris

Good point, unless you buy Dan Drazen's theory that roboticization is 
inevitably fatal due to toxic waste build-up in the remaining organic 
tissues (assuming fully roboticized people have any, which doesn't really 
make sense, but why else could Uncle Chuck eat a chili dog _and_ enjoy it?)

        Maybe.  But it was Robotnik who tricked Knuckles, remember?  (See
the now classic Sonic #13, "This Island Hedgehog," for full details.)

        Actually they're adults at that age, considering that they are
animals, not human.  Besides, they already tried marrige (see Sonic The
Hedgehog #18, "Wedding Bell Blues" for full story.)

        Hi, guys,
        I was wondering today.  How old is Sir Charles (Uncle Chuck, Sonics'

Uncle Chuck!  I would like to know how old he is.

Yeah, the fireworks accompanying the celebration reminds me of
the title of the "Love -- American Style" TV show, where they
were most symbolic...

> There is heavy breathing

I must have missed this bit -- I had the volume turned down
to where I could barely hear it so that I wouldn't wake anyone
sleeping in the next room.  Guess I'll have to watch my tape
of the episode.

	Well, after a few weeks my computer was repaired 
after a little problem and I checked my mail. I have a few 
comments and/or questions:
	1) I have finally decided to send my Sonic RPG to 
Ratman and I would like any suggestions/comments on it ASAP 
so I can refine it. Please send the messages to me.
	2) Someone asked when Sally/Sonic was born? I 
estimate the year 3219. 
	3) The movie sounds great.
	
That's about it,
Thanks,

        Yes, they are.  You could be right-it could be Knuckles.  Or, it

I still say Knuckles...

I thought it sounded more like a sneaky laugh... kinda like Muttly (an 
old Hanna Barbara cartoon... Dastardly and Muttly were the evil guys)
Last I saw them was in the 'Laugh-A-Lympics' cartoon.

You know... this is one of the things I've always liked about the whole
concept of Sonic the Hedgehog.  Each person 'telling the tale of Sonic
vs Robotnik' seems to tell it in a different way.  Let's see... so far
there have been:
  * Story provided in the games
  * Archie Comics version
  * European Fleetway Comics version
  * Saturday AM TV Series
  * Syndicated Weekday TV Series 
  * Those mini-books (I forget the publisher's name)
NONE of these are fully consistant with any other (some aren't entirely
self-consistant either). And that's not including the fanfic stories. 

This is a lot like the old oral storytelling tradition.  This isn't 
something you see often these days.

I was going to.  But not anymore.  Here's what's gonna happen:  Some guy
(can't remember who) is SENDING me 40 disks.  THEN he's gonna UPLOAD it to
HIS FTP site & post the adress here.  That way you can all download it.
BTw- if anyone wants to send me 17 disks (why he's sending 40, I dunno. ,..
I think he said he wants TWO copies) send me disks, and some postage so that
I can send it back, and I will... copy the game and send it to you.
REMEMBER the requierments, tho..INTEL pentium...can't be a generic brand..
(you see, I got SCREWED... I got a Cyrix 686.... and it doesn't detect it as
a pentium..) oh well.. anyhow... LATER!

        Hi, Guys,
        I was looking in a game magizine and I saw info about the Sonic
cartoon from Japan.  It starts like this: (prepare to be shocked)  

        Sonic has made his Japanese animated debut, to remind us once again
how american cartoons have bad graphics.  the U.S. Sonic Sat. morning
cartoon has been canceled (unfortunately,) but it would definitely be around
today if it was as good as the Japanese counterpart.  The Japanese Sonic is
a rentar-only OVA, (the first of hopefully many) so the animation is much
cleaner than you could ever expect from a TV show, but the characters"
on-screen presence is what makes Sonic so cool.  It's like playing the game,
but in anime form.  Or something.
        Since it's only 27 minutes (part 1 of...?), there's not too much to
say about Sonic.  Sonic and Tails are out to save the president, who's been
kidnapped by arch-villain Dr. Eggman (Robotnik in the U.S. version).  So,
they run off to Eggworld, fight some minor enemies, fight a boss, meet
Knuckles, and then volume 1's over.  It doesn't sound like much, but it's a
heck of a trip, and the pace is as fast as Sonic himself.  Though Sonic
sounds a bit gruff, the voice actors are pretty cool, and the new charecter,
Sarah (the president's daughter), is a nice addition to the cast.
        Slim through the possibility is, Sega might one day bring the series
here, but until then, enjoy some shots of what a video game-based cartoon
should be.......

        Whoa!  Talk about weird, huh?  I have those shots, by the the way,
and when I get a chance, will scan them so everybody can see them.  And no,
Princess Sally, Bunnie, and Knothole are not in the cartoon.  "Boooo."
Guys, does any one know if there is an AMERICAN Sonic movie coming out that
goes along with the REAL story?

        There was no laugh from "The Thing," only Snively laughing in the
background.  Come to think of it, the creature sounded like it was sighing
deeply.

        Hi,
        I was looking at my Sonic comics today, and something confused me.
It showed in some issues that Sonic has 4 fingers.  Then in more issues, it
showed Sonic with 5 fingers.  On the late ABC TV show, it showed Sonic with
4 fingers.  How many fingers does Sonic have?

several companies, including Sonic Team themselves, in order to get ahold

To Chris:

Kiken here, as many fingers as the artists feel like drawing hime with. 
The original Japanese illustrations of Sonic all have 5 fingers, some of 
the US artists keep that, others follow that US standard of drawing 
toon-ish characters with only 4 fingers.

Kiken signing off.

Varies. (I guess you noticed *THAT* though, huh?)<G> 

Sonic has five fingers. A number of comics and cartoon artist drop it to
four, maybe tradition or habit, since most toons have four?

   Hi all,
        Do you notice that, in the Sat AM show, once you're roboticized,
that's it. There is NO tomorrow. Sonic can't jump on you and then you'd be
just who you are, like in the games. If Sonic did do that, you'd be nothing
but old appliance parts. Take Uncle Chuck. Sonic would set him free if he
could. Anybody else notice that?

                                                                Later,
                                                                Eggman

Four fingers is the norm for cartoons because it's easier to animate 
characters with 4 fingers than characters with 5.

Sonic started out with 4 (3 fingers+thumb) in the Archie comic miniseries,
too.  But he had to grow an extra digit when Sonic 3 came out, so he could
hold up 3 fingers, and still have one folded into the palm of his hand.
Otherwise, it would look odd.

Tails got an extra digit per paw at the same time, but the other Freedom
Fighters didn't.  Maybe it's a status thing with furries...

Actually, in the games (and in Sega's concept of him) Sonic has had four
fingers and thumb from the beginning. The original comics published by Sega
(before Archie entered the picture) shows him with five digits as well. (One
even has pictures of him before he was blue.)

It wasn't until the Archie mini-series Sonic lost a finger, but he gained it
back in issue #1 (of the current number series, not the original
mini-series...) More likely than not, someone at Sega pointed it out to
Archie. If any of the comics since then (I didn't check them all..) show
three fingers, it's a sign someone has slipped back into old habits. :-)

As for the TV shows, 'Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog' always has four
digits...since it is done 'toon' style, that makes sense. Best I recall, he
always had five in the ABC one, which was done in a more serious style, but
someone that watches that one more than I do could shed more light on it.
All of Sonic's other animated appearances (game ads on TV, mostly) show five.

This is in response to the burning question "How many fingers does SONIC
really have?"

The answer depends on what modelling sheets SEGA provides to Archie Comics.
When the comic first came out, SEGA would revise the visual look depending on
what the powers-that-be decided the visual look of the upcoming game. (At
least that's what we were told.) SEGA didn't even coordinate the visual style
between Archie and the DIC Saturday morning show until Mike and I showed up. 

One of the earliest story ideas we proposed involved Sally changing her look
and color from what Archie had to match the Saturday morning show. All of a
sudden, people were surprised to discover there was indeed a difference.

So if the artists at Archie, and I count myself among them, aren't consistent
at times with how many fingers everyone has, at least you now know the answer
isn't strictly carelessness from deadline pressure.

There's a link to Sonic Team's main page on mine (I recently added it), 
but to see the video box covers, the URL is:

http://www.sega.co.jp/nights/sonic/svideo.html

That should be right. If that doesn't work, go to my homepage and use the 
link to their main page, then click on the link that will send you to the 
"svideo" page. Remember, this is Sega of Japan's site, so guess what 
language everything is written in? Problem is, unless you have a Japanese 
Netscape browser, all the text comes out as ASCII nonsence. Oh well, the 
pics are really cool.

        Hi, Gang,
        Here's a tantalizing question.  Who's faster, The Flash, Superman,
or Sonic The Hedgehog?  (I can't wait to hear the replies on this.)  Please,
tell me what you all think, (or know).  Just in case you're wondering,
no-this is NOT a survey, it's just for fun.

Metal Sonic is finally getting into the cartoons! I wonder what his voice
(if he has one) sounds like?

To whoever asked before:

Kiken here, well its about time, but I found a server to decompile the 
ACSII garbage into readable Japanese. I went back in and checked the 
titles of the episodes:

#1 Journy to Eggmanland 
#2 Sonic Vs. Mecha Sonic

The episodes are roughly 30 minutes each.

Hmmm, I wish my kanji was better, I'll report back later with the voice 
actors' names after I do some checking up.

Kiken here, well, there are only 5 voice actor credits on the page, 
Sonic's, Tails', Dr. Eggman's, Knuckles', and Sarah's. Its possible that 
he does speak, but either its one of two thing:

#1, its probably only a line or two and would only be mentioned in the 
credits at the end of the episode

or

#2, one of the before mentioned character voice actors does him as well, 
kinda like how in the US Sat am show, Sally and Nicole are the same voice 
actress.

Hi there, fellow Sonic fans.

I would like to make a list with all the episode titles from the weekday  
Sonic cartoon (you know... the one with Scratch, Grounder and Coconuts).   
Alas, all I got from my local TV network was a list with the _german_  
titles (I live in Germany, and of course the german titles are totally  
different to the american ones).  Now I need your help to complete the  
list:

Anyone who has seen any of the weekday Sonic cartoons, please send me the  
episode title, the author(s) and a few sentences describing what the  
episode was about, so I can find it on the list I have.  If you remember  
the names of some characters that appeared only in this episode, please  
add them too.

If you all support this, maybe I can soon post a list with all the german  
_and_ american episode titles of the weekday Sonic cartoon.  Please send  
your infos to

        weekday@deco.franken.de

There are 65 episodes of the weekday cartoon, so I need every support I  
can get here :)

Thanks in advance


Alessandro

        Is Movie from the U.S.?  Does it have the same voices?  Or is this
game from Japan?  In other words, yes, I'd like to know to know about the
Sonic movie.
