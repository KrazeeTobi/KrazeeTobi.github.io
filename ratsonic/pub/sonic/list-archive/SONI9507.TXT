Subject: meet women of the former USSR through romance ads


       ##    meet women of the former USSR through romance ads    ##

     Months ago, Olga Kosmina placed my personal ad in several papers of the former Soviet Union.  Since that time I have received over 40 responses for the $50 I mailed Olga.  (I believe she paid the newspapers something around $35 and kept the rest for her efforts.)
     I have found greater success and savings by placing my own personal romance advertisement rather than purchasing addresses through Russian "bride" catalog companies.
     If you are interested in placing a personal romance ad as I did, contact Olga.  She has built up a list of most every newspaper and magazine in the former Soviet Union and could help direct your ad to certain areas if you wish.  She writes, "please say that I place all ad _throughout_ Russia and other countries of former Soviet Union, not only Western Russia."
     Olga is 23 years old, has a bachelors in biology and works full-time as a florist in Kiev.  She speaks, reads and writes English as well as her native languages of Russian and Ukrainian.
     I realize that it is a very trusting person who would put $ into an envelope and mail to a foreign country.  If you would rather send a letter of inquiry first, Olga will respond to your questions.  It takes about 16 days for a letter to travel from the USA to Kiev.

Olga Kozmina
Dekabristov Street 5 - 178
Kiev 253121
Ukraine

     I have found that by placing a single bill between two pieces of newsprint inside an envelope, the Ukrainian post cannot see through and does not bother to tamper.  I have yet to lose a letter sent to Kiev.  I am sorry that Olga does not have e-mail because it would make contact with her much easier.
     I am posting anonymously because of the inordinate amount of e-mail which I would receive -- inquiries as well as flames.

Best Wishes,

David and Olga

     Although Olga has never seen a newsgroup nor heard of "net-etiquette," she believes that helping others exceeds the cost of angering those who feel the net should not be used in this fashion.
     IHA (I humbly ask) that you not flame the postmaster of this site.

peace. . .

I hate when that happens. Sorry about the spam. The powers that be (me

happening.

Subject: Sonic#26: Princess Sally-- a Weasel??


Sonic #26 has just arrived at my section of space-- it's nice
when your orders appear within a few months of the cover date. :)

In this month's iss, the Freedom Fighters are cooling off by a lake
[Otaku/FAQ note: Sonic has a "Hydro-sonic" speed, fast enough to run
across water, like a basilisk] when Robotnik starts up a weather
machine that causes a sudden summer's day snow storm.  The FFs take
refuge in a cave system, where they discover a few Arctic Mobians
who have been hiding underground to avoid discovery by Robotnik.
One of the group is Erma, and it's my guess she's an Ermine after
looking at the other characters' names and her brown and white pelt.

The funny thing is, Erma looks a lot (a _real_ lot) like Sally-- the
face and tapering muzzle, the long cylindrical body, the relatively
small ears, the brown (at least during summer) pelt.  So maybe the
Princess could possibly be of mustel heritage too...  Hmm.

My personal bias says she could be a European Weasel. :) The
Americas have a critter called the "Short-tailed Weasel", right?
Maybe Sally wears those boots constantly to hide she's a Black-
Footed Ferret. :)

(Face it, the squirrel idea implies the princess shares a genetic
linage with mice and rats.  Bleegh. :P :)

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest@lists.mv.net)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  You may change your subscription
status from "live" to digest or from digest to "live" at any time.
If you decide to change your subscription status, be sure that you
unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore, or you will
be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages twice.
See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net.
This address applies to both versions of the list.  If you feel
you must flame someone (other than Robotnik (g) ), please do so
in mail directly to that person.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters
and stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  You may post messages on the Sonic games to
the extent that the focus is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or
characters, and not on the games themselves.  Asking why Knuckles
rarely appears in the comics is on-topic, but asking how to become
"Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.  If you are interested in the
Sonic games too (or instead), please see "Other Internet Resources"
below.

Please do not post any of the following types of material:  binary
files, commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.
If you do, you are subject to immediate removal from the list and
suspension or termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt,
please contact the list manager before posting.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read
them before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from
the ftp site in /pub/sonic/text.  The Sonic Merchandise List can
be found in the same directory.  See "FTP Site" below for more
information.

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
messages, send the command "get sonic mail.txt" (but without the
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo@lists.mv.net.

How To Change Your Status
=========================
To change from "live" to digest, send this text to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic-digest
    unsubscribe sonic
    end

To change from digest to "live", send this text to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    subscribe sonic
    unsubscribe sonic-digest
    end


FTP SITE
========
There is a companion anonymous ftp site for this list.  Just ftp to
ftp.hff.rat.org and go to /pub/sonic.  Upload files to /incoming; all
uploads are subject to approval.  You will find sounds, images, list
archives, and a variety of information.  Users without regular ftp
access may use ftpmail.  Please contact the list manager if you need
help locating a ftpmail server.

Other Internet Resources
========================
rec.games.video.sega / alt.sega.genesis
    Two Usenet groups for discussion of Sonic the Hedgehog and other
    games from SEGA.  Use these groups instead of this mailing list
    if you want to discuss the Sonic games, get codes/cheats, etc.
rec.arts.animation
    A Usenet group for discussion of animated cartoons.  Please
    read that group's FAQ before posting there.
alt.binaries.pictures.cartoons / alt.toon-pics
    Two Usenet groups for posting image files related to cartoons.
    The a.b.p.c group was intended to replace the a.t-p group.
    Some sites will carry one of them, some will carry both of
    them, and many sites don't carry either of them.
alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons
    A Usenet group for posting digitized sound files related to
    cartoons.  This group is not widely propogated.
WWW
    The mailing list has a companion Web site with information,
    images, and links to Sonic-related newsgroups and other Web
    sites.  You'll find it at http://www.hff.rat.org/sonic/ .

Many thanks to Ratman (Paul Hurley) for giving us a virtual Knothole.
The list manager is Erich Schulman who can be reached by e-mail at
sonic@rat.org.

They don't have the best reputation among humans, but that doesn't mean 
there is anything inherently wrong with them.  And, besides, just think 
of all the mice and rats who make the supreme sacrifice for scientific 
research.

On Mobius, all the species seem to get along together pretty well.  A 
place where a rodent can be a rodent without shame.

So where did he go?  He's not come out to defend rats.  If he went to 
Mobius, he forgot to bring me along. :-)

My guess is that Manak tried to extrapolate from existing character 
designs in order to create Erma and some of the others.  This way 
they'd all 'fit together' artistically.  [I'm assuming Erma is supposed
to be a weasel of sorts]

The Wolf Pack in Sonic's 2nd season Saturday TV show was a good example
of making a new character's design 'fit in' properly.

That, by the way, was one of my only complaints about the Princess Sally
miniseries.  All the new character designs, although good, didn't seem
consistant with original characters. [An extreme case of this would be
if Prince Valiant introduced a new character which looked like someone 
from Peanuts... now that would be weird.]

Sore loser. :)

Is there any chance the uploader of the miles*.gif pics could do
scans of Erma and place them on hff.mv.com for a week or so until
this controversy passes?

Another rave: Apologies to anyone, but saying that Princess Sally is
a Fox or part-Fox is just the /biggest/ reach!  There's the absence
of a sizable tail and dark markings on the limbs, the colour of her
pelt (who ever saw a milk-chocolate fl^H^Hcoloured fox?), and all
foxes' irises turn yellow after infancy.  Nope, no way, not ever,
not never...

Dear friends

Rat: Cool! did you read the books?

     Yeah, I've read all three.  But I'm a big fan of the movie.  My personal
favorite animated movie.

ES: And you know via e-mail why I've got to stick up for rodents ;-)

     Like I said, cute squirrel. :-)

ES: On Mobius, all the species seem to get along together pretty well.  A place
    where a rodent can be a rodent without shame.

     In the Princess Sally mini-series, Hamlin and Geoffrey made swipes at 
each other that referred to each other's species.  But other than that the 
characters aren't very conscious about their species.
     DYN:  Actually, most of the time no one species is prevalent.  There was
the Wolf Pack, the Dragon nest, and the hyena gang in the series.  But besides
those instances, there's usually not more than two sentient beings of the same
species present.  
 
JF: All the new character designs, although good, didn't seem consistant with 
    original characters. 

     I noticed that none of the new characters had "stick figure physique" 
designs like the characters once had in the beginning of the comic book.  
Personally, I'm glad that they're moving away from that style. 

     See ya around.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

Also, if you assume Sally is indeed a squirrel, she would be in danger 
with Tails and Antoine (foxes) around unless the various species get 
along as well as they do.  Squirrels and foxes don't make a viable 
combination on Earth.

But, due to Robuttnik, there aren't many of any species left.

>I say that Sally is in a species of her own native to Mobius.

   I'd have to disagree.  Considering that all the other characters are based
on animals here on Earth, whoever thought up Princess Sally probably based
her on some Earth animal also.  (There's only one exception that I've seen so
far: Dulcy.  This, however, can be explained because dragons have been a
popular mythical character for a long time.)  The easiest way to settle this
is to simply ask the person who created her.

That seems to be the current issue, whether they really get along that 
well (which in this case, they don't.).

        Ok,  I couldn't help it any longer.  Your polite argument has
gained my attention.  Sally is a fox!!!! Her father is a fox, and her
nephew Tails is a fox. To Chris Bajrd, yes Sally lackes the fur colour and
markings, but so are Tails and her father. They both have the large tails,
and the right colour, but admit it, Sally would look terrible with a huge
tail. If you continue to call Sally anything but a fox, you're making a
comparison not unlike calling Sonic a warthog even though Uncle Chuck is a
hedgehog. : p

          To the other  people, she looks nothing like a weasel or a rat!
Even though in one of the Sonic comics, I think it was his special one, a
person wrote in asking Sally 's species. They replied that she was a ground
squirrel. But as stated in the above paragraph, there are too many odvious
features showing she is a fox.

          I can't beleive Antoine is a fox, it can't be possible. How could
they insult foxes so? Of course he could be, but I think a poodle suits
him. Is there any one out there that likes him?

        To  the uploader of this controversy, keep it here for I want to
see how this ends!

Ummm...as somebody pointed out a long time ago, Sally is *not* Tails' aunt.
Remember that in the cartoon series, he also called Bunnie "Aunt Bunnie",
and everybody called Sir Charles "Uncle Chuck."  And, as somebody else pointed
out a while back, the Archie people themselves have said that she is a
squirrel.  Now, I know that doesn't hold water with many people :), but they
are the ones who write and draw her, so their's is a strong opinion, at any
rate.

And there's too many features that make her a squirrel as well!  The shape
of her face and head being the biggest one of all.

Ahem...ze ansahr being yez.  There's a lot to Antoine I think that we never
see since he is only used for comic relief most of the time.  But think about
it:  He has a hopeless crush on Sally, is always trying to prove himself to
her and the rest of the Freedom Fighters, and is still always coming up short
and feeling ashamed because of it.  With what I've seen in my life, I can
certainly relate to that.  As for being an insult to his species...I don't
think so.  You could say Tails is also (foxes flying??  HA! [not my true
opinion]) or even the mascot for the Fox Kids Network (that goofy little
thing?? HA! [again, not my true opinion]), but really I don't see how you
can say any person, real or ficticious, is an insult to their species,
even tho' some people do admittedly come close. :)

Speaking as the "someone" who theoretically nailed down the question of
Sally's species in the FAQ File, I've come to accept that the "Sally is
a fox" crowd simply will not yield.

As for Antoine, you might want to check out the two latest Teitelbaum
novellas [_Fortress of Fear_ and _Friend or Foe?_].  While Teitelbaum
manages to get the hang of Sonic's argot to a greater degree, Antoine is
NOT reduced to comedy relief with a funny accent.  He seems to want to
emerge as a character in his own right, and a sympathetic character at
that.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

This is your only notice!

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
Michael Teitelbaum.  Troll Associates, 1995

PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
Michael Teitelbaum.  Troll Associates, 1995.
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie. 
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
plausible, except that between the November and February sweeps,
ABC actually moved StH to the 8:00 am Eastern slot, which would
have put it opposite "Dog City" on Fox...at least, until the next
time Fox jazzed with ITS lineup.  I remember posting a TAPE ALERT
and that several fans didn't get to tape the first showing of the
Doomsday episode as a result of the time switch.  Source for this
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics, as posted
to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.

#16
[Summary by Erich Schulman]

"Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....

"The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.

     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!]; that Sonic was just a
little slow rescuing Bunnie from the roboticizer.  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.



#24  [Jul 1995]
"When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski
(Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
"Panic in the Sky!"
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hriar_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
     It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by
somehow draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps
the island afloat.  Already having established a presence on the
island, Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans
to use the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole. 
Knuckles won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes
the Chaos Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik
abandons it, expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole
(though how he suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).

But Knuckles replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd
tell you how he switched it with a phony one which was the one he
broke, but I don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an
invitation to join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of
the island now involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
"Fire Drill"
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
check out the Sonic-Gram in issue #23 for a hint.
"Lord of the Floating Island"
     While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25
"Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
Story: Mike Gallagher
Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."

Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.




Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
above), which conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the
rest of the second season.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie. 
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

Dear friends

ES: Also, if you assume Sally is indeed a squirrel, she would be in danger with
    Tails and Antoine (foxes) around

     I'm inclined to the theory that Sally is a ground squirrel as was her 
mother. ( Note how in one of the comics Sonic and Sally were able to have 
children and their son was a hedgehog while the daughter was a ground 
squirrel ).  If this was the case, I'm now wondering if there was any contro-
versy in having a "predator/prey" mixed marriage. :-)

BB: Considering that all the other characters are based on animals here on 
    Earth,..

     In "Blast to the Past", Sally gave the year as somewhere in the 3000's
( I forgot exactly what year. ) This made me wonder, could Mobius be the Earth
in the far future, wherein some animal species evolved into anthropomorphs?
 
     See ya around.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

Well Logic like that really has no place in a Saterday Morning cartoon.
If the food chain really mattered here then sonic whould be in danger
around tails. And alos Hedgehogs are verry slow in real life. So when it
comes to cartoons stuff like that goes aside.

And Yes it is posable that Mobius is a future Earth. Maby the Human race
slowed down when it came to evolveing and that gave the anmials a jump.
then humans slowly died out so that there are verry few of them around
3000. But some whoud live till then that whoude explain Robotnik and
Lazar.

        Ok, so I made a mistake. But to Archie saying she is a ground
squirrel, they do make mistakes. After all, when asked what Sally's age is,
they replied fifteen. But in the cartoon "Drood Henge", she says she has
two years before her coming of age. (18) So who's right? I figure that the
cartoon is right, so your strong opinion has lost some of its punch.

> Antoine rules!  (I don't think he's a fox though.)

        I guess he's alright, and on the fox subject....All RIGHT!!!!!

       > But as stated in the above paragraph, there are too many odvious

         Sally 's head resembles her father in many ways, that proves she
is a fox! To those out there who think Sally is a chipmunk or ground
squirrel, if you want those species, watch Chip & Dale, there're your
chipmunks!!

        Before I leave, in Sonic the Hedgehog #25, sonic faces Mecha Sonic.
In the end of a race through a zone, Sonic pours on the speed and finishes
the race. Mecha Sonic tries to catch up but there is to mush friction and
his legs melt off. Now he wasn't running, he was flying using his jet pack
and the jet intake in his stamach, so why'd his legs melt off due to
friction? It's not the heat from the jet pack, he specifically says it is
friction that does it. And if so, why didn't his arms melt off too?

   First of all, if it was a future Earth, why isn't it still called Earth?
 Secondly, at the current rate of technological development, I'm sure that
Sally would own something much better than a simple hand-held computer
capable of having an intelligent conversation with anybody, disregarding
their accent.
   My theory is that Mobius is another planet.  Obviously, most of the
animals evolved at the same rate.  (Some more quickly than others according
to "Run With the Fox.")  Since they have gotten to the point where they are
considered "intelligent life," they don't eat each other as their ancestors
did.  Tails is a mutant, Sally is a squirrel, and Antoine is a fox.

What was the most unsettling when I saw the cartoon was how thin
Sally was.  However, if her species were weasel..

Also going on what the cartoon and comic shows us, I'm also going to
insist that Bunnie is part Lop. :) (Lops: several breeds of domestic
rabbit whose ears `flop' when they mature.)

And as Drazen says in the FAQ, who's to say that the Mobian age of maturity
isn't 17?  After all, the cartoon *also* says she's 15, but it never gives
an exact number for the age of maturity.  So, 15 + 2 = 17, no? :)

But I digress...

Believe what you will.  If yer that set about it, then believe what you will
and quit pouting that others don't believe the same way. :)  I look at her
face and I see a squirrel.  Go fig.

The site is red_panda.tbyte.com 9999

For EWAN, make sure the under the oprt selction, not only is 9999 entered 
in that field there, but also that the field is selected instead of the 
'Telnet' selection (Telnet's default port is 21)

Assuming you connect, be sure to connect as a guest, and make a note of 
the EMail address where you send your request for a character.  Page a 
wizard to let you out of the guest room.  When one does, you'll be under 
some tree.  type out, then taxi, then gfo ...Welcome to the Great Forest!

(HINT:  The Entrance to Knothole is hidden...always study the scenery 
descs carefully for clues)

Hope to see you there!

        Has anyone have the awnser for this yet?

        A cross breed is believable, and a possibility. To those that
comment on the size of Sally's tail, Antoine has no tail as far as I can
see in the cartoon and comic. So I must ask, if Sally isn't a fox because
of her tail, what is Antoine?

This is a recurring headache.  Whereas the Archie Comix writers insist
on making everyone age 15, the "Drood Henge" episode left the impression
that Sally is 16.  It's simply a discrepancy.

These are books; novellas is more like it.  Each is well under 100
pages, with occasional full-page illustrations by Glen Hanson.
Teitelbaum's style has improved since the first book; he's gotten the
hang of writing in Sonic's hip argot.  One other notable feature: he
plays Antoine extremely straight -- no jive Clouseau accent or general
bumbling.  You can find the books in the Juvenile Fiction center of your
local bookstore, with the latest Goosebumps volume and the novelization
of the MMPR movie (ack!).

Ok i tryed it thismorning. It was way cool!!! I still haven't fount
knothole yet. Maby i missed something coud i have another clue? Is it
near the place where Robotropolis cam be seen. or is it naear that
underground house? I am guessing it's near there but i don't know. I was
on for maby 15 minuts. Does much action go on there. I mean does
robotnik ever try anything? Let me know

Btw: it said something about makeing your own places there. If that is
true i might try that. I will try writeing some stories sometime that
take place a year after Doomsday. and tell how Robotnik comes back from
the dead. (But not for long).  And I might want to try makeing some
areas there that match the storys.

So, you need another clue to the whereabouts of KNothole...well, your 
first mistake was leaving the location where the taxi dropped you off.  
That area is where the secret entrance is...look around, see anything 
familiar?  A treestump?...vines one could swing on?  Didn't some of the 
earlier sonic comics depict Knothole being underground?  Ask 
yourself...what direction do you use to go underground?  BTW, if you read 
the desc real good of the place hwere that Underground house was, you'd 
see that's where Bookshire lives...ah there's no place like home.  Also, 
you can feel free to wander around Robotropolis, but Robotnik, wheather 
he's on or not will know you've been there! ;)

As for things happening, like I said the whole MUCK is more socially 
oriented, but still, I sometimes have Packbell raise some sort of 
annoyance.  Hope to see you around sometime, if you ever see Bookshire 
about, please say hello! :)

Why couldn't Sally simply have had her 16th birthday in there somewhere?


I was thinking about the meaning of the knothole village gang's names the 
other day...

Sally Alicia:
Sally is the diminutive form of Sarah, which is Hebrew for "princess".
Alicia is a variation of Alice, which is from the French and Germanic,
meaning "of noble rank".

Bunnie is a shortend, diminutive form of Bernice or Berenice, which is
Greek for "bringer of victory".  (Nike, or Nice, means "victory".)

Nicole is the French feminine form of Nicholas, which is from the Greek for
"victory people".

Dulcy (or Dulcie) is from the Latin for "sweet".

Miles is from the French, from Germanic for "merciful". (Miles Prower is a 
particulary bad pun, IMHO.  It's no wonder Tails doesn't like it.)

Antoine is the French form of Anthony, from the Latin family name Antonius.

Boomer/Rotor:
Boomer may refer to a predilection towards explosive experiments.
Rotor is a rotating part of a machine, so it has a kind of mechanical
engineering connotation to it.  Does Rotor seem to go around in circles,
or be kind of spinny?

Sonic Maurice:
Since "Sonic" literally means "pertaining to sound", this may refer 
either to his speed (i.e. Mach 1), or to his big mouth.  Probably both.

"Maurice" (a joke from the Archie Sonic mini-series) is French for "the Moor".
Perhaps Jaleel White had just been casted as Sonic's voice at that time, and
this is a reference to him? 

I find the names of other, incidental characters to be amusing too, such 
as Spelunk the mole, a miser living underground in a cave, from an early 
episode of the Sonic weekday cartoon.

Ablation (a la` spacecraft reentry).  Possibly Mecha's arms weren't
effected because they kept a smaller profile to the atmosphere (and
notice that it was the `shoes' that melted, not those spindly legs).

Still, does anyone have a pet theory on how an organic mixture that
is 90% water can have better heat resilience than another object
held together at the molecular level with metallic bonding?

Wow, we're all getting as bad as the Star Trek people... :)

It could be due to the heat generated from friction with the air. Since his
legs stick out farther than his arms, they would experience the most friction
and melt first.  Also, his arms are pointing directly into the airstream, 
which also reduces drag and hence frictive heating, while his legs dangle
down, broadside to the wind.

Although Mecha-Sonic has titanium steel alloy skin, I would guess that his
arm and leg joints are weak spots...

Antoine is a buffoon.

Sally wears most of her tail on her head...
Regardless of her species, I just love the way Spaz drew her in Sonic #25,
especially when she is parachuting (on pp. 19 and 21).

As much as a supporter of libraries as I am, you'll probably have better
luck at your local bookstore.

Hard to say where Teitelbaum draws his inspiration.  The first book was
obviously based on the original miniseries, though taken in skips and
short hops from one story to another.  I haven't nailed down the second
story's origins, or how it differs from the comics' explanation of how
Bunnie came to be partially roboticized.  The third book (Fortress of
Fear) has a fairly complex plot line and is IMHO the best of the lot so
far.  Don't know if it's based on a comic or TV ep.  "Friend or Foe" is,
as I said, based on the "Game Guy" ep from the Sat AM series [second
season].  There are too many eps in the syndicated (daily) Sonic to keep
track of, and as far as I'm concerned they are of dubious canonical
value.  As for the comics, I only started getting into them with issue
#18; anything before that, I'm afraid I can't help you.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

    What discrepancy?  Sally is fifteen, but nearly sixteen (say

   First of all, it's Miles Prower, no "L."  But to help you out, think of
speed and how to measure it...  (As long as you're in the U.S. anyway.)

OK, try saying it to someone else and tell them to repeat what you just said.
That's how I learned the pun. I happened to say it to someone, and they had
no idea I was saying "Miles Prower".

        Again, I can't argue.

        To all the theories about Mecha Sonic's legs melting, those were
believeable, so I step down from that topic.

        Now for a theory I thought up on Sonic's brain. It is called the
Sonic's Cranium Catastrophy. To reply, on the subject put Sonic's Cranium.
Ok, here is the theory: Sonic travels at various increadable speeds. Now
when he stops, it is almost imediate.  So his brain would hit the inside of
his skull a lot. This could be the reason he is so rude, impatient and so
slow minded. Does anyone agree?

        Has anyone tryed to start a petition to make them create more
cartoons? Hey, with a little work we might get the cartoon back!

        Oh, are the novels any good? Er, novellas....are there any  NOVELS?
100 pages is a little short for me. And I haven't seen any graphic novels,
are there any out there?

        In the cartoon, Sonic gets his chilidogs from a dispenser machine.
How could it keep creating chilidogs everytime Sonic wants one or two a
day? And no "It could be a replicator" replies, this is not Star trek.

        A person was asking for help with a game. Where on the net is this
game? I need directions.

        One last question, how old is Antoine?

'Fraid I have to disagree.  Rude Sonic may be, impatient is a given, but
"slow-minded"?  That's not only an insult, it's too far out of
character.  It's the impatience, the refusal to noodle things through,
that causes Sonic to act rashly at times.  Not the Mobian equivalent of
"playing football without a helmet."

ABC may be a lost cause at this point, certainly for the '95-96 season.
Then again, it was reported in rec.arts.animation (by no less a honcho
than Mark Evanier, producer of "Garfield and Friends" and frequent
contributor to the r.a.a fun and games) that the ABC kidvid execs who
committed the network to showing a series based on "Dumb and Dumber"
have gotten the sack.  Any kind of letter-writing campaign would have to
be a 3-pronged one: writing to ABC, DiC and Sega.  Who knows, maybe by
the 96-97 season Morphin' mania will have run its course as well.

Of the Teitelbaum books, "Fortress of Fear" is, I think, the best
written.  "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Friend or Foe" rely too much on
reworking established plotlines.  I doubt there are any graphic novels
out there.

He was about the same age as the other kids in "Blast to the Past" so
I'd put him in his mid-teens as well.

Well that wouldn't be possible.  For one, Sega cancelled the contract after
DIC started to sell some animation stills from the show and that got
Sega P.O.ed. Also robotnik bit the dust at the end of the show. Now that
wouldn't be too much of a problem. I am trying to write a story where
robotnik comes back in a way that sounds like something they would do in
Jurassic park.  OOPS I SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY!

I think they are 100 page books with some pictures. I have also seen a
book that was made for younger kids. It's a really short book like a
picture story book. Forget what it was called.

Also if they can't get the TV show back why not they get Time Warner to
get rights form Sega and Archie to make some Audio plays like they make.
I have heard a few of TWs Audio Plays before and they do a good job.
What i was thinking is they could get the cartoon cast back together to
preform some of the Comics

I thought Sonic was intellecutally slow. Sally is always teasing him about it
too. Sonic is pretty clever (getting out of situations), but I can't see him
taking apart Nicole and be able to figure out what all the pieces do. He
would rather just shake her until she worked.

According to Sonic's bio, he is "of average intelligence."  He's not slow, 
just impatient, which causes him to rush into things.

That's one rumor (cf. faq-dd) which you are presenting as a fact.  If you 
heard this officially, please state your source.

At the end of the Doomsday episode, he left but there's no clear 
indication that he died, leaving the door open to his return if he so 
chooses.

I've been thinking about these issues in terms of a piece of fanfic I'm
working on.  My working consensus is: Sally is extremely bright, and
being royalty and all she had early chances to take advantage of it.
She may not have had intensive training before Robotnik took over, but
Julayla (her tutor, whose passing was noted in Sonic #18) apparently saw
to her education.

Again, I have to assert that Sonic's "slowness" in intellectual terms
has more to do with his character/personality than with his physical
ability to learn and/or retain.  Despite such jibes from Sally as "Where
were you when they passed out the brains?" (cf., "Sonic's Nightmare,"
first season, SatAM), I think Sonic is of average intelligence for a
Mobian.  He's swift enough to come up with reposts and retorts for
Robotnik and Snively, so he's got a quick wit at the very least.  

Anyway, that's my story and I'm stickin' with it.

I may not have the definitive answer, but that never stopped me from
posting before ;-) :

TV execs measure "decent popularity" in terms of Nielsen ratings, and as
long as Sonic was up against MMPR on Fox, the blue guy didn't stand a
chance.

Then, too, we're entering another "cleaning up our act" kidvid phase.
Every so often, the guardians of the airways and the just-plain
busybodies prevail on the TV execs to at least put on a pretense of
serving the public interest.  Because of this, execs will look to their
more innnocuous fare, thinking that if nobody complains about it then it
must be OK (while conveniently forgetting the corollary to the theory:
if nobody says anything about a series it may be because it's such a dog
that nobody watches it).  Still, ABC had committed Free Willy for a
second season so rather than continue screening a show that had fallen
by the Nielsen wayside they simply started doubling-up on the show which
had already had its option picked up.  If they think they're going to
earn any new viewers as a result of this, though, they might be in for a
disappointing surprise.  This all makes sense if you're a TV programming
executive...admittedly a lower form of life than your average hedgehog.

It's really tricky to program a TV station or network, particularly when 
planning out your next fall season.  You don't know what your competition 
is going to do until they announce it (if they even do).  Likewise, they 
don't know what you are going to do until you announce it (if you even do).

I had a class where one of our projects was to develop that fall's prime 
time schedule for two networks (this was in a Spring semester).  My group 
was assigned ABC and Fox.  One decision I made for ABC is that the 
network was doing so bad on Saturday that we would drop everything and 
start over from scratch.  Sunday posed a special problem because 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" was the perfect lead-in to "The 
Simpsons" on another network (a rarely seen situation).

Call 'em jaded, short-sighted, over-conservative, or what have you, but 
those people do have difficult jobs.  There's enough money on the line 
that one wrong move will get you fired.  And being known as the man, 
woman, or hedgehog who caused your now-former employer to not even show 
up in the ratings for a time slot (or (yipes!) an entire evening) will 
make it very tough to get another job in the business.

It was interesting to see how my group's decisions compared against the 
actual fall schedules.  If you want to see them, ask me for the RTV 414 
project in direct mail (not on the mailing list).  I think I still have a 
copy of that year's fall schedule.  I know I don't remember it now.

> Forget about Willy; Free Mobius!

Let's give Willy to the Annheusser-Busch people so he can go join Shamu; 
maybe they'll get to be good friends.

As for Mobius, that's why we're here, supporting the Rebel Alliance until 
victory has been achieved.  Remember to buy bonds and it's "taxes to beat 
the Axis".  Oops, wrong war :-)

I believe "Free Willy" technically belongs to the Warner Brothers
(yes, and their sister, Dot). As far as I know, the WB network is
pulling out all of their cartoons for the "WB Kids Network." I
donot know if they have a Saturday Morning line-up, but if they
do, I pray they will take that 2 1/4 ton anchovy with them.
	But as far as I heard, Sega shredded the contract with
DiC (the Sonic cartoon producers) because they sold animation
cells without Sega's permission. I am currently asking one of 
Sega's tech support people to look into the possible existance
of a third season with Sonic. Let's all hope for the best...

	I actually wrote Sega, and DIC about this.  Neither of them gave 
much of an answer.  Sega, just sent me the standard old form letter 
saying, "we value your comments" blah...blah...blah.   (If they valued my 
comments they would have answered my question!)

	DIC, didn't even bother to respond.  I've never had much luck at 
getting responses from studios though.  Both Nelvana and Hanna-Barbarra 
have ignore me as well.

	Anyone care to write a letter to ABC and let 'em know what we 
think?  If it was really Sega's fault for the show getting cancelled, 
perhaps we should all let Sega know how upset we are at them.  I'm 
beginning to wonder if perhaps Sega is purposely trying to hide Sonic 
under the carpet....maybe becuase of Saturn?  They are a video game 
company after all.

	Just thought I'd share this little bit of nothingness.

	Brad.

   Sonic has practical knowledge.  He knows the ins and outs of Robotropolis
(and where to get a good chili dog), but I doubt he could go about graphing
quadratic equations.  Since Robotnik conquored Mobitropolis when Sonic was
only five, he obviously didn't get a chance to learn much.  But since Rosie
was with him /*Blast to the Past 2*/, she probably tutored him when she
could.

Well that is true in the Comic and show. But in the Avntures of Sonic
the Hedgehog Cartoon he actuly alot smarter there. I think the reason is
because he is the only main hero other then tails. So they have to make
him smarter. I do think that he could learn alt more if he could just
slow down so that someone could teach him.

Never having seen the show, let alone the closing credits, I can't
comment on whether FW is a Warner show.  However, I DO know that ABC has
already pencilled it into their fall kidvid lineup, with the expectation
that it'll be some kind of nonviolent, politically-correct
window-dressing.

Comparing the syndicated Sonic with the SatAM or comix is problematical
for me, at any rate.  The syndie series is simply way over the top in
terms of situations and characterizations, and has little or no
consistency with the rest of the Sonic material.  Besides, it's not
difficult for Sonic to look "smarter" than villains who, in the words of
good ol' Joe Bob, are as dumb as a box of rocks.  Robotnik was a
credible evil presence in the SatAM series: in the dailies, he's closer
to being a buffoon.  So, IMHO, there's no comparison.

Actually, Annheusser-Busch already HAS Willy.  The "actor" who played him
resides in Sea World in Florida.

Actually, it is true according to Sega.  You might not see it through his 
actions or some situations he's involved in, but that's the official word, 
according to his bio.

Don't you mean the MIDI-Mapping Diaper Changers?  (My friend Nils came up
with that name...)  Anyways, it's clear that the ABC people are just a
bunch of IDIOTS, if they choose a terrible show based on a fairly good
movie over a great show based on a great game series!  Oh well...I only got
to see Sonic a few times anyway...

While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]


#26 [Sep 1995]
"Way, Way Past Cool"
Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
"Fortified"
Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
plausible, except that between the November and February sweeps,
ABC actually moved StH to the 8:00 am Eastern slot, which would
have put it opposite "Dog City" on Fox...at least, until the next
time Fox jazzed with ITS lineup.  I remember posting a TAPE ALERT
and that several fans didn't get to tape the first showing of the
Doomsday episode as a result of the time switch.  Source for this
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics, as posted
to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.

#16
[Summary by Erich Schulman]

"Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....

"The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.

     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!]; that Sonic was just a
little slow rescuing Bunnie from the roboticizer.  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.



#24  [Jul 1995]
"When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski
(Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
"Panic in the Sky!"
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hriar_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
     It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by
somehow draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps
the island afloat.  Already having established a presence on the
island, Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans
to use the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole. 
Knuckles won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes
the Chaos Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik
abandons it, expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole
(though how he suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).

But Knuckles replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd
tell you how he switched it with a phony one which was the one he
broke, but I don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an
invitation to join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of
the island now involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
"Fire Drill"
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
check out the Sonic-Gram in issue #23 for a hint.
"Lord of the Floating Island"
     While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25
"Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
Story: Mike Gallagher
Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."

Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
"Way, Way Past Cool"
Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
"Fortified"
Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.


Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
above), which conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the
rest of the second season.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.

While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

Ok this might sound like a wild idea. but I got to thinking of what if
we had an On-Line meeting on the internet. The reason for this is that
it is the best way to have a meeting because of course we are all in
difrent parts allover the world. and haveing a normal gettogether is
imposable. So my idea is to get togeher in one of 3 places. and just
talk live about whaterver. Here are thoes places

IRC Internet Relay Chat
We whould meet in a room on the IRC and just talk like in a
teleconference on a bbs. IRC isn't to hard to get to. most Online
services have it. and if you use an account that alows you to get on the
net useing a Winsock. the you can D/L a program to get on. I use IRC
Cliant (It^s on Ratman's FTP i think.) And go

IRC Telephone.
Anotehr IRC but this requires more. You need a sound card and a
microphone here to use this. It is alos a bit less secretive so if you
want to hide behond a digatal mask this whoudn't be a good idea. You
need the program Internet Telephone that is on Ratman's FTP i think

Furtoonia

Probly the best of them it is a Vetural world with a Veturial Knothole.
All you need there is Telenet



Let me know what you think about the idea. I don't know. it might be a
stupid idea. I think the heat's geting to me.:) But if we decide to do
this then i can set it all up. Just let me know.

I play Sherry on FurToonia (though I haven't been online in a while; Star 
Control's been sucking my time.  Anyone who's good at this game, email 
me?)  If anybody wants to drop a note, feel free!  (Lemme know you're

Dear friends

BB: First of all, if it was a future Earth, why isn't it still called Earth?
    Secondly, at the current rate of technological development, I'm sure that
    Sally would own something much better than a simple hand-held computer

     Nicole's not so bad.  She does seem to have a huge database, and artifi-
cial intelligence. :-)
     I'm thinking that perhaps human culture somehow died off when humans no
longer were the prevalent sentient species.  So some aspects like Earth's name
were lost/replaced, but others like Bunnie's and Antoine's accents survived.
But now I'm having these "Mad Max/Thundarr" flashbacks. :-)

BB: My theory is that Mobius is another planet.

     Maybe Earthlings colonized it with some humans and animals genetically 
engineered to evolve to sentient species.

BB: (Question: why are all humans bent on world domination?)

     Both of them? :-)  I wonder if there are any other humans left besides 
Robotnik and Snivelly.

BJI: >an exact number for the age of maturity.  So, 15 + 2 = 17, no? :)
     Um, no. Sally *did* say she wouldn't come of age until 18.

     So she's 15, going on 16. :-)  It's probably a couple of months before
her 16th. birthday.

CB: What was the most unsettling when I saw the cartoon was how thin Sally was.

     Tootsi Pop physiques seem to be common in cartoons.  I'm happy that the
creators are taking her design more seriously in drawing her not as thin as
before.

DJD: "Fortified"
      Mawhinney, though, seems to draw her a little on the "squashed" side.  

     Definitely.  Mawhinney did an excellent job with the characters in the 
"Princess Sally" miniseries.  But he seems to have particular trouble drawing
Bunnie.  Her torso looks like it's been mashed in between her appendages.
     Bunnie was featured in the last page of Sonic #25, but she's put behind
the credits.  Shame.

DJD: as far as I'm concerned they are of dubious canonical value. 

     There's just no way the daily series could be in the same continuity as
the weekly series.  The formats are just too different.  The daily series is 
a bad imitation of old Warner Bros. cartoons, and it has no explanation for 
its premise.  I'd rather it be just another of those parallel universes alluded
to in the comic book, one I'd rather not visit. :-) ( Scratch, Grounder and
Coconuts did make some appearances in the comic book, but thankfully they seem
to be gone now. )
     Well, at least the daily series has Miss Possum. :-)

     See ya around.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

The hypertext version of the Sonic Merchandise List is now ready!

Go to http://www.hff.rat.org/sonic, and then choose the Merchandise List.

I put in a lot of time with Nicole to write and debug the HTML code, and I
think Sonic and Sally would be pleased with the results.  If you have Web
access, please take a look at this new list.  I already like it better
than the plain text version.

I remain fully committed to the plain text version.  Both versions will 
be updated together, and no products will be added to one without being 
added to the other.

log on CompuServe.  Some information was cut and pasted from Sonic
mailing list postings and from personal e-mail.

Ok it looks sofar that the meet is a good idea. But personly i whould
prefer IRC or IRCtelephone over Furtoonia for one i still havn't go my
charector yet that i sent away for. So i might start to take a vote form
everyone. starting now and ending next friday send me where you think
whould be a good place for a meet. and also a good time. because of
major time zone difrences we might have a little problem there. a good
time that was mentened was sunday morning at 8:00 EDT  this whoud
however meen people over in calif. whould have to be on at 5 in the
morning and over in aust. it whould be 11 at night. So send me a good
time. And make sure it is in EDT time or i will get messed up.

This will NOT be an autmated vote counter so you can send me coments.
And don't flood the list with votes send them right to me at.

John Mankowski@outdoor.com

Send me where you want the meet (IRC, IRCT, FURTOONIA, ect.) and a good
time in EDT.

Or if you see me on IRC you can tell me there On irc and irct i am
Sonic100. And once i get my charector on furtoonia i will be
Sonic-Clone.

Thanks

I have just finished adding Mobius to TV Net (http://tvnet.com/TVnet.html).

I've included this list, both FAQ's, the episode list, and two newsgroups 
(a.f.s-h and r.a.a).  For compatibility with TV Net's FAQ retrieval, I 
changed the ftp site storage of faq-dd from 3 parts back to 1 part.  
(If you use ftpmail, the server should be able to break up the file into 
64K chunks, if you cannot receive messages >64K.)

In addition to TV Net, we are listed in the Publicly Accessible Mailing 
Lists (PAML) list and the rec.arts.tv FAQ.  We might also be in AOL's 
private list of mailing lists, but I can't check that because I'm not on AOL.
I also know of 3 Web pages with links to the list's page 
(http://www.hff.rat.org/sonic).

Ok i found a Sonic Doom wad. Well it is more like a patch. You run it in
your Doom DIR. And I find it not exactly to my likeings. All it really
does is replace the IMPs with Tails. And it is done really cheeply too.
all they did was scan a pic from the game. WHen he gets close he starts
to look Bloocky. Oh well try this if you have Doom I will send it to the
FTP site later tonight. And if you don't have Ftp then let me know and i
can UUEncode it for you. But because of a recently added rule I will
only do that over private E-Mail.

The file will be called tails-fw.zip I will be sending it to
hff.rat.org.

The changes in the images structure (announced seperately) broke some
links in the HTML version of the Merchandise List.  I believe I have fixed
all the broken links.  As several hours passed between the directory
changes and the update, I hope no one was inconvenienced by not being able
to use the links before the update was complete.

There are no new listings in this version.  I will not maintain version 
number parity with the plain text version until 2.1.0 of either is reached.

The images directory at the ftp site (ftp.rat.org) has changed.  This 
change will break any automation or ftpmail script you might be using.  
The following directories are now under /pub/sonic/images/ :

comic     - Scans from the comic book
drawn     - Drawings
game      - Anything releated to the game
icons     - Little pictures
logos     - Logos of Sega, Sonic or whatever
perv      - Of a... ahem. Mature content.
plush     - Plush dolls (little stuffed animals)
poses     - Sonic and others in various poses
other     - What the heck are these from?

Hopefully these changes will make it easier for you to find the pictures 
you're looking for, and they will not cause any significant inconvenience.

You asked if having the image files at your FTP site would be an
inconveniance. I would say, no, because now the images are 
organized even more. Thanx, dude.

John, you've earned a spot on the Mobius Freedom Fighters Wall of Honor
or whatever they've got.  You've also made my job as keeper of the FAQ
File a heck of a lot easier!  Many thanks.

I'm afraid I can't help you with the UU business; I'm not that well set
up.  There are a couple of virtual Mobians who have made graphics
available: David Pistone (aka, Rotor) and Ratman.  Either one of them
could steer you in the right direction.  I'm sure there are others as
well.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled freedom fighter.

Recently I was told that there was ONE issue of Archie's Sonic comic which 
I didn't have.

Issue 1/2 (Also drawn by Scott Shaw!).  It apparently was a 'free insert' 
in another comic (or in one of those little newsletters the comic stores 
slip in your bag talking about all the new comics coming out).

Has anyone ever seen this?  Is this a myth?

By the way.. anyone know where I can get 2" silicon wafers cheap?  
OOP!  I'm mixing business and pleasure again!

James:

Sonic 1/2 exists.  It basically reprints the first 6 or 8 pages of Sonic #0.
 It was polybagged with an issue of "Sega Visions" and also was part of a
special promotion with Howard Johnson's.  It was printed entirely on standard
newsstand stock, and did NOT have a glossy cover.  Hope this helps.

Best regards,

    No myth.  I remember it from many many moons ago... it was a
promotional piece for (NOT ARCHIE) the Sonic Video Game for the Genny.
No-one knew that the game would take off like it DID,tho...

    There was also a "Sonic Comic" advertisement in some comic books--
DC, MArverl, and maybe Archie, about the Game.  It had almost nothing,
as far as I know, to do with the present comic book, but was rather an
advert for the new (then) Sonic game for the Genisis.  Hmm... I wonder
if that can be found anywhere?  It described a REALLY different origin
for both Sonic and Robotnik...

Yo!  I finally got Sonic 27 today.

I'm not gonna review it but here's a teazer.

---

Sonic?  A Badnik?! 

On a routine recon mission, Sonic is captured and gets as case of comedy's 
favorite medical affliction (amnesia).  Robotnik befriends the confused
Sonic and trains him to be a Badnik!  Is this the end of Knothole and the
Freedom Fighters?

---

Sonic-Grams info

They said the 48-page Sonic 'Triple Trouble' is going to be out in 2 weeks
but isn't that what they said last time?   What the heck?

Next Month. (Issue 28) Tails solo story [countdown to his 3-part miniseries].

Also... Sally replies in the letter's page and says Geoffrey St. John is 
Australian.

There was a Sonic Advertising Supplement in "Disney Adventures Magazine"  
Volume 2 No. 1, November 1991 (the issue with Michael Jordan on the  
cover). 7 pages, story & art by Francis Mao.

The story looks a lot like the early Sonic comics from Fleetway, starring  
Robotnik, Sonic the Hedgehog, Flicky the bluebird, Johnnny Lightfoot the  
hare, Sally Acorn the squirrel (not the Sally we know, she looks totally  
different) and of course some badniks from the first Sonic game.

It tells how Sonic and Dr. Kintobor become friends, how Sonic gets his  
blue color and power sneakers, the origin of the chaos emeralds and how  
Kintobor is turned into the evil Robotnik due to an accident in his  
laboratory. A review of this story (with totally new artwork) has been
printed in one of the Fleetway comics. (Remember my posting from February   
02, 1995?)

Best wishes


Alessandro

Hi there.

After reading about the new Sonic book 'Friend or Foe' in the Sonic FAQ =20

our favourite blue hedgehog.

Because this might be of some interest I've decided to send it to the =20
mailing list.

BTW, I've already bought the four Sonic books by Martin Adams.  I'll post =

a synopsis as soon as I find the time to write it down.  At the moment I'm =

too busy playing on FurToonia MUCK...

Ok, here comes the booklist:

Ha-haa! :) (Okay, so it's not really that funny after being in the
same position myself..)

Now it's ObSonic time:

Maybe Mobius is a duplicated Earth, created during some advanced
physics/mathematical (hence the name) lab experiment gone awry..

Let's see..  The duplicate planet also could've been created
intentionally, but several million years "in the future" to see how
the animals evolved (or to prove theories on the development of
sapience?)  The humans that are there could be [descended] from the
survey parties.  Ant' and Bunnie's accents then would be the result
of their ancestors learning language from survey party tutors from
the appropriate ethnic group...

There's a "prime directive" of the above survey parties to limit
their influence in technological development..? :)

Mawhinney's Bunnie also has a very child-like face.  Ugh, IMHO.

Are you curious about Sonic's counterparts here on Earth?  I just added 2 
new links to the Web page [http://www.hff.rat.org/sonic]:  "Brian's 
Hedgehog Page" and "Hedgehogs", and the latter has a little tribute to 
our Mobian friends.

Work on the next version is now underway.  There will be quite a few new 
listings as well as some additional info on existing listings.  I think 
there will be enough changes for me to move directly from 2.x to 3.x.  
I'm also going to include a real "What's New" section inside the list 
instead of posting this seperately.  As before, there will be both a 
plain text "a" and a Web "h" version.  I may also be making a IPF "i" 
version, but that may not be ready for some time.

That's right, my WWW Sonic page has moved.  The new address is:

Those of you who have placed links to my page in your pages, please make 
the appropriate adjustments.

During the move, I've added a new story and a few other little things.

As always, submissions of any kind to my page are always welcome and

Yikes!

Looks like I've got my work cut out for me, incorporating these titles
in the FAQ File.

Hats off to your hard work, Erich!

Funny, that's the same question we were supposed to be asking ourselves
during the "No Brainer" ep of the SatAM series (second season).  I hope
this doesn't mean that the writers are running out of gas.  If they need
ideas for stories, however, there are people on the list (myself
included) who would be only too happy to make suggestions.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

I'm not the one who compiled the book list.  I did forward the message to 
the list which made it look like my post.  I think I've got pine 
configured properly so that I can now forward messages to the list 
without them looking like my posts.  I'll try next time I need to forward 
a post.  (Should the need not arise for some time, I will use a test 
message.  I just don't like testing my software on the list.)  I also 
filed the list in the text directory at the ftp site.

I have had to forward messages from several subscribers this month.  
Here's why.  Early this month, we (and many other mailing lists) got hit 
by a spammer advertising personal ads for some lady in the former USSR.  
The next day, the Sonic list implemented a new policy that blocks posts 
from nonsubscribers.  If your posting address and subscription don't 
match, your mail will bounce to me for approval instead of going out to 
the list.  This policy change has already stopped three more spams that 
would have hit the Sonic list (the same spammer, too).

Let the record show that the book list was written by Alessandro Sanasi.

I will be incorporating the book list into the next merchandise list, 
along with the Sonic .5 comic, and a few more listings.

There are 5 new images at the ftp site in the /pub/sonic/images/other 
directory.  The filenames are:

tailatk.gif
tailfly.gif
tailpled.gif
tailshck.gif
tailstnd.gif

They are not big files, so if you like Tails you will get them all (g).

Well here is what my vote about the meet came out

IRC Won with 60% of the votes. As for Furtoonia and Furrymuck they both
broke even with 20%. That was alot better for those 2 then i expected.
Still IRC is the winner so that is where the meet will be held.

I got MENY! difrent time requests. Trying to find a perfect time was
hard because all the times sent in by people where all difrent. But
based on the most popular times 6:00 PM saturday Whould be the best.
This whould mean on the west coast it whould be 3pm in Eurip it whould
be 10pm but on the other side of the wold it whould be around 6am
sunday. I hope this won't ruin anyons plans for those times. But that
whould apear the best times. As for a date well how does Saturday July
29th sound. if that is a problem let me know I am trying to make
everyone i can hapy. Sorry if I can't do so.

Count me in.

But all the talk about furtoonia caused me to join, and I found Knothole!  I
think it's really fun to be "in" Mobius, and talking with all the Mobians. I
also like it A LOT better than IRC since nobody can take over and kick
everyone out, which happens a lot with IRC. It's a lot harder than IRC since
you can do so much more. Like create objects, describe yourself, and "move"
around to different parts of Mobius. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I
think it's worth it.

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partial3 3.99

Sonic Adventure Gamebook Vol. Bk. 4  The Zone-Zapper  04/1994
Author: Nigel Gross & Jon Suitherland
Tradess.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season (see FAQ #9).

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]


A tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who expressed their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.  [C.f. FAQ File question #1 on
the subject]

#3
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in "Blast to the Past" and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.



#5
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to business as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture
was repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
the hall.


#9
     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate evil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needle bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to
give it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dwelling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.



#15
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     





#17
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.

Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 ("All The
Mail's About Tails!").  Theories range from transplantation to
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no "official"
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
(in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with "Deadliest of
the Species" in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving"
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
"creative differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
delay.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
of the "Doomsday" episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original four-part Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
     Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
     Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher & Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2  [Sep 1993]
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.

#3  [Oct 1993]
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4  [Nov 1993]
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.


#5  [Dec 1993]
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6  [Jan 1994]
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7  [Feb 1994]
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8  [Mar 1994]
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
the hall.


#9  [Apr 1994]
     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate eil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10  [May 1994]
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11  [Jun 1994]
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12  [Jul 1994]
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13  [Aug 1994]
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14  [Sep 1994]
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.


#15  [Oct 1994]
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     


#16  [Nov 1994]
     [Summary by Erich Schulman]
     "Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
     "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. "The Mail's About
Tails" (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
from the roboticizer ("Rabbit Deployment," #3).  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.



#17  [Dec 1994]
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.



#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night" (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
     Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
     An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
     Story and art: Scott Shaw!
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
     /Spaziante
     Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile
evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.



Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
     "Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich &
          Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.
     Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
far and describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is
renouned for his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally & Geoffrey
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
     Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD),
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).




#22 [May 1995]
     "The Return"
     Penders/Spaziante & Harvey M.
     The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with
Children; cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_). 
Sonic & Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics," (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
deactivates "Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
"You owe me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
Spaziante artwork.
     "Tails Knighttime Story,"
     Decesare/Manak & John Dagostino
     As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows"
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
     Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep
reading."  Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
"creative differences" theory in Q7.


Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species": Part 2
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed).
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
if so what does she look like? "Of course...her origin may yet be
told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in "Bloodlines"
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.




#23   [Jun 1995]
     "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
order to save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
which I'm not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
     "Vol-ANT-teer"
     Decesare/Manak
     Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.


Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
the chamber blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred. 
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

SallyGram: Horace Hawkins (14) wishes Sally a Happy Valentine's
Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
     "When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
     Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
     Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
     "Panic in the Sky!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hrair_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
     "Fire Drill"
     Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Must be Nack the Weasel -- check out the SonicGram in
issue #23 for a hint.
     "Lord of the Floating Island"
     Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
     While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25  [Aug 1995]
     "Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
     Story: Mike Gallagher
     Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
     "Way, Way Past Cool"
     Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
     "Fortified"
     Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.





NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics (Sonic #3).  In addition, both Uncle
Chuck and Muttski in this book has been successfully
deroboticized (see above), which conflicts with "Sonic
Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the second season.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

Yeah.  Very similar plot to 'No Brainer' so far (Its actually a 2-parter
in an ARCHIE series.. whoa!  That's never been done in the regular Sonic
Series).  I don't know how they'll solve it but so far its being done a 
bit differently than 'No Brainer'.

-- Re: Sonic 1/2 --

The guy who told me about this actually had a copy.  Yes, its on standard
'newspaper' stock.  Yes, its just the first 6 pages from Sonic Miniseries 
issue '0'.  Yes, it was a free insert (I don't know where he got it) 
Also, Its not called 'Sonic 1/2' its really called 'Sonic 1/4'.

I don't know if he's letting me keep his copy or if he just wanted me to
see it (he was drunk at the time).  He DID let me keep a nifty Sonic 2
Iron On pattern :)  Now I just need to get a good blank t-shirt.  Too bad 
the pattern only has Sonic holding up 2 fingers in a Sonic 2 logo.  I was 
hoping Tails would be on it as well.

-- Re: Meeting Vote --

I never got around to voting, but I've always had trouble with IRCs.
I keep forgetting how to do stuff.  And yes, the few times I HAVE tried
IRC with a friend we've always been bombarded by dweebs kicking people 
off and flipping everyone's bits and other stupidity.

I'd prefer the meetings on Furtoonia (or FurryMUCK) but if IRC is the 
ultimate decision it would be helpful if someone told people like me
how to even get ON an IRC [and some basic commands for chatting, moving
from one channel to another, seeing who's on, etc.].

humm i was just thinking that we could try all the difrent paces and see
what everyone wants. I mean first we try IRC then Furtoonia and then
IRCT and so on. then we see what everyone liked the best. I can't
moderate a meeting in Furtoonia till I get my chrector if the vote is
changed I will send for one. Maby you could moderate a furtoonia one of
your own. Think about ti

BTW:how does someone take over and kick everyone off in IRC?

I take it that's EDT.  That makes it 4:00 pm in my timezone (MDT).

Why don't we agree on a channel name?

I propose #sonic

Then if people are on IRC anyway, we can check to see if anyone is there.

IRC
advantages: easier to use. more people have access to it.
disadvantages: people can take over the channel.

Furtoonia
advantages: there is a knothole set up, which can make it more fun
disadvantages: harder to use. takes a bit of getting used to.

> BTW:how does someone take over and kick everyone off in IRC?

Easy. If you get ops, you can kick everyone off. And you can ride a netsplit
in to get ops. I dont' want keep going on about such an off-topic thing, but
trust me, It's not hard. If we have a meeting on IRC, I'll demonstrate it.

I will go with an idea that was posted some time ago #sonic is the
channel
also this wednesday I will be in that channel at 8:00 pm EDT if you
wanted to test out IRC. If you have Winsock acess on a service and no
IRC. FTP to rat's FTP and somewhere there you can find a program called
IRC Client. I got a program form FTP.CDROM.COM called IRC2 and it works
good.

Hope to see ya all there.

Dear friends

RDB: The Sally robot is nearing completion when Snivelly brings in a memory 
     board and tells Robotnik "here we go - enough memory to mimic _human_ 
     (emphasis mine) capability" (or something like that) - hmm, maybe that's 
     another log for the "what is Sally" flamewar/discussion?  :^)

     I think it gives possible evidence for the theory that Mobius was created
by humans doing an experiment on sapience.  Since humans were the first 
sentient beings, "human capability" is the common term for sentience.  
Personally I'm really leaning to this "NIMH" scenario, wherein some animals 
got their human customs from the group of scientists who first worked on 
Mobius.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

It's
rat.org
/pub/msdos/winsock

and the program is called mirc. It's for Windows. You have to have
winsockets. Many people get their net access over just a terminal. If so, try
just typing "irc".

I've been looking everywhere for this issue (Sonic #27), but have had no 
luck at all finding it.  Does anyone know of some stores in Connecticut 
that might have it?
About a week ago (on 7/17/95, I think), I subscribed to the Sonic comic 
book using the back-issue order form from issue 25 or 26.  However, I am not 
sure which issue my subscription will start with.  Can I expect to 
receive #27 as my first issue, or should I expect my subscription to not 
start until #28 or #29?

Please let me know, as I'd really like to read #27.

Ok i will try to anser some questions here

It will be held on Saturday July 29th  at 6:00 Pm EDT 5:00 PM CDT 4:00
PM MDT, 3:00 PM PDT  and 10:00 Pm England Time (If I didn't mention your
time zone you can use a time zone map. Sorry)
We will use the Channel #Sonic if that is taken and one of theas
channels are active then we are useing an alternate ##Sonic##
#Sonic-Fan#

IRC can be acessed using sevral difrent progams MIRC is my fave. As for
UNIX and other accounts like that I really don't know. I am used to the
Winsock protocol. Most online services such as Prodigi (AKA FRODIGI) and
Compuserve don't have IRC. If you are a member of one of those i'm sorry
but I don't think you could be there.

I am planing some Events for the meet such as Sonic Speed Trivia. If you
want to recamend a game we can do that too. There are plenty of IRC
games that can be played.

Thats it i guess. Let me know if you have any questions

Give it some time.  It should hit my local stores (Knoxville, Tenn.) in 
about 2 more weeks from now.  And I'll get my copy in the mail about a 
week after then.

Drugstores, supermarkets, and convenience stores are often good because 
there are a lot of them in town.  If one doesn't have it, check the one 
two blocks down the road.   Also check "Comics" in your yellow pages.

My guess is 29, maybe 30.  28 only if you're lucky.  Back issues will 
arrive a bit more quickly.

Same here.

I dunno what Dan's reasons are, but IRC tends to be heavily frowned upon
by colleges, and unless I'm at school with a nice direct ethernet connection
(which I'm not), I'm at the mercy of what they say goes and doesn't go on
my unix account.  IRC = no go.

This is in response to a few posts I've received that asked for an
explanation:

The short answer: I have to bow out because it's taking place on a
Saturday.  As a Seventh-day Adventist who observes a Saturday Sabbath,
I'm afraid my Saturdays are "booked solid" for the rest of my life.

Not that the technology did them a heck of a lot of good.  After all, it
wasn't the AMOUNT of memory that gave the game away, but WHAT WAS
MEMORIZED.  They didn't sweat the details (the hand jive, the
story-telling technique), thus sowing the seeds of the plan's
destruction.

Or am I taking this too seriously?

I've got two questions for you Sonic-philes, one game-related, one 
comic/show-related:

(a) Which of the game tunes from Sonics 1, 2, 3, K, CD, et cetera are 
your absolute favorites?

(b) What music makes you think of the various members of the Freedom
Fighters and/or the Empire (excuse me, Robotnik's forces)?  I'm
particularly looking for something for Tails, whom I haven't quite come up
with the perfect piece for.  Joke names okay ('Do Run Run' for Sonic?),
but I'm thinking more of music that *sounds* like the character. 

I'm gonna be out of town for the remainder of the week, but I'll collect 
the responses nonetheless, so mailbomb me!  (:3

#1: Green Hill.
#2: Ugh...the music all sucks in that one.
#3: Theme
S&K: Tie between the theme and the mini-boss (James Bond-type sound) music.
SCD: DEFINITELY AND WITHOUT A DOUBT, Sonic Boom...ESPECIALLY when you hook
it up to the stereo!
Knuckles Chaotix: Can't say; I've never played it.

>(b) What music makes you think of the various members of the Freedom

"Empire"...that's how I typically think of it.  Anyways, that's a toughie,
since I haven't been listening to much music lately (except what my mom's
written, and of course, that'd be no help to you guys, since you've never
heard it).


><

Just because everything is different doesn't mean anything has changed.

PS: I won't be able to make the IRC meeting, either.  It all comes of
having to access the 'Net through Fraudigy instead of having the real thing.

Arrangements are underway to make a transcript of the IRC meeting
scheduled for Saturday.  The transcript will not be made available on the
ftp site unless the participants are agreeable to it.  For now, I'm going
to ask for a 2/3 vote.  Let me know by direct mail if you think the
minimum should be higher or lower. 

Do not vote now.  The method for voting is not yet set.  It may be a 
online "voice" vote, or it may be by e-mail.  If you have a strong 
preference for one over the other, let me know in direct mail.

One complication to this is that I don't know as yet whether I will be in 
attendance.

I will release more details as they get worked out.

Without a doubt, 'Carnival Night Zone' from Sonic 3 is my absolute favorite.
I also like 'Casino Night Zone' from Sonic 2, and basically I wouldn't mind
listening to *any* of the Sonic game tunes repeatedly.  They are definitely
some of the best examples of Genesis music.

Funny you should ask this :)
I constructed the Knothole Village Pub on FurToonia, and I used to have
song plaques dedicated to each Freedom Fighter (I've since taken them down,
for personal reasons, but I guess I'll hafta put them up again someday).
These are some of the tunes I and others came up with:

Sonic:  The Theme from 'Sonic the Hedgehog' by Noisy Neighbors.
Sally:  "Wildflowers" by Tom Petty
Bunnie: "Code of Silence" by Billy Joel
Sir Charles:  "Mr. Roboto" by Styx
Antoine:  "Too Much Time on My Hands" by Styx
Tails:  "Somewhere Out There" by Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram

Also, I think 'I, Robot' by the Alan Parsons Project is very fitting.

I enjoyed all the music from Sonic 1. From Sonic 2, the only ones
I didn't like were the Oil Ocean, the Special Stage, and (vs
mode) Haunted Forest (or something to that idea). From Sonic 3, 
I enjoyed only the first acts of all the stages, the second stage
for the Lava Reef, the Gumball Machine Bonus Stage, the final
attack [either at the end of the second act of Launch Base (Sonic
3) or after the second act of Death Egg (Sonic 3 & Knuckles)], 
the vs mode intro, the vs mode race areas, the Continue music, 
and the Game Select music. I haven't seen Knuckles Chaotix or 
heard enough of the Sonic CD to pass any further judgement.

How about Ray Steven's 'The Streak' or Aerosmith's 'Livin' on the 
Edge' for Sonic, Stevie Wonder's 'Isn't She Lovely' for Sally,
the Fifth Dimension's 'Beautiful Balloon' for Tails (umm, maybe
not), and the Empirial March theme from the Empire Strikes Back
for Robotnik's forces? Can anyone else come up with anything 
better?

I take one of those suggestions back. The Fifth Dimension's
'Beatutiful Balloon' is best suited for Antoine for the Comic 
story 'Twan With the Wind from issue #12.

For Tails it's easy: "Flight of the Valkyries" :)

And with a few slight changes to his DNA, it
could be the theme from the movie "Airwolf" :):)

I don't know about a DNA change, but an *attitude* change
would be in order. ;-)

    Me?  I think the fave music from the games ain't from a Genny but
from Triple Troble fro Game Gear,  that being the Locomotive Chase theme
in Stage 2 act 3.  THere's this very tension building opening overture
in it.

Hrm.. I only have Sonic 1, 2, and 3 (I rented S&K though)... 

I don't remember much from Sonic 1 since its been a while since I played 
it.  I think that 'Star Light Zone' is my favorite from that game but
I'd probably have to listen to them again to make sure.

>From Sonic 2, I liked the music from Chemical Plant and Metropolis Zones
the best.  Oil Ocean runs a close third for me... I didn't like it until 
I 'screwed up' the 'select any level' trick and somehow made the game 
play the Oil Ocean theme ALL THE TIME (with no other jumping or ring 
grabbing sounds).  It gave the entire game an eerie feeling.

I liked the Sonic 2 'finale' music as well (when the credits are rolling).

A friend of mine decided to 'tape' some of the music from Sonic 2 and he
played it in his car.  Sonic 2's 'bonus round' music was VERY appropriate 
for the winding road we were on.  Now if there were rings on the road to 
drive over... wait a minute.. if there's road construction we could've 
used CONES! :)  [i guess we're lucky there wasn't any road construction]

Fom Sonic 3?  Hrm.  I liked several of the scores but there's no question
about it.  My absolute favorite has to be the 'finale' music (while the 
credits are rolling).  Its my favorite for all Sonic games I've seen so far.

Sonic & Knuckles... I rented this so I haven't gotten to hear ALL the music
but my favorites are the Mushroom Hill zone music, and the level with the
sand and those stupid ghosts.  Another favorite score (when playing Sonic)
is when Knuckles pops out of his hiding place to check out what's going on
(RIGHT at the beginning).  Something about this whole beginning sequence 
practically 'defines' what I like about the world of Sonic. 

I haven't seen Chaotix, Triple Trouble, or Sonic CD so I have no opinions
on these.

Hrm... 

I'd have to listen to lots of music while thinking about this before I 
could decide for sure.

For Sonic, maybe one of those high speed 'Techno' songs.
 
Robin Hood suggested:
> Sir Charles:  "Mr. Roboto" by Styx
Maybe something by Kraftwerk would be better :)

David Pistone suggested:
> "Weird Science" by Oingo Boingo for Rotor. :)
I dunno.. Rotor's not THAT crazy.

How about the French National Anthem for Antoine.

Christ suggests:
> For Tails it's easy: "Flight of the Valkyries" :)
Yes, I can see it now...  Tails wearing one of those horned Viking helmets
singing opera.

> And with a few slight changes to his DNA, it could be the theme from 
the movie "Airwolf" :):)
I actually like this suggestion :)  Maybe for an 'adult' Tails though.
You definitly need something 'cuter' for Tails. :)

--
You know... long ago on this list I heard at one time a 'live-action Sonic
movie' was being considered (but was never made).  I really have to wonder 
how to 'visualize' such a thing.  Would they dress actors up to 'sorta' 
look like the characters (e.g. Mario Brother's movie) or would they make 
Sonic computer animated, or would they use the 'Howard the Duck' approach.
Would they keep Jameel White (that Urkel guy) as the voice of Sonic?  
Lately I've been curious about this movie.  [also.. on an unrelated topic..
wasn't a 'Lost in Space' movie planned?..  What happened to it?]

Ok I think I will agree with 2 earler posts that a good song for tails
whould be that one song they for flight seens in movies. (Forgot the
name but my dad has a record of it somewhere:) And the theam form Weird
Science is good for rotor. But if you are talking about game theams here
is a list i came up with. This is form Sonic 2 all you do is play thease
games in Sound Test

Sonic      :05,0E,16,17
Sally      :0C,10
Tails      :01,06,0D,0F,15
Rotor      :03
Bunny      :07
Antoine    :08,0B

You might see them difrently but the songs that play for thoes #s remind
me of thoe charectors.

BTW: Where in the game is Song 10 from. I don't remember hearing it in
the game.

That tune was to be in the coveted "Hidden Palace Zone", a level that was
supposed to be a secret level in Sonic 2 but was never put in.  Eventually,
when they put the level in as two levels (Hidden Palace and Sky Sanctuary)
in S&K, the original music was scrapped.

   Simple explanation: Humans are the most complicated, highly evolved
animals on the planet.  If you have enough memory to mimic human capability,
you have enough memory to mimic ground squirrel capability as well.

   That's because it's not in the game.  Originally, there was an extra
level, but Sega later took it out and left the music in.  This is what I want
to know: Did Sega physically delete it or did they just not allow access to
it?  If the level is still in the cartridge somewhere, it's possible to get
to it.

I heard something about it a year or so ago, but don't know any more than

I'll ignore the "evolved" part for now - I don't want to get into a 
creationism flamewar/discussion :^)

I can't remember the exact quote, but I'm reminded of Spock's line from 
Star Trek IV:  "only human arrogance assumed the message was for them" :^)

Which raises another point: technically the furries on StH aren't all that 
furry - I see no animal characteristics in them ala Tiny Toons...

Of course, you have to remember we don't see much of them in their "off
hours."  Usually, it's been all business -- the business in this case
being guerilla warfare.  But I guess that's where fanfic comes in.

I've been following the thread about the music of the Sonic video games,
and I feel I must confess:

Not only don't I own a Sega game product of any kind, but the only time
I ever tried playing StH (when I rented a Genesis unit and game
cartridge overnight), after 4 straight hours I still kept wiping out by
falling into the lava during the second level or part or whatever you
call it.  I'm not about to kid myself: when it comes to video games, I'm
pretty pathetic.  So I guess it's true what they say about teaching an
old (in my case, 43) dog new tricks.

There.  I said it.  Now, back to overcompensating by working on the FAQ
File.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a

Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic

On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday.

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season (see FAQ #9).

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

This represents an expanded synosis of the second of Teitelbaum's
books.

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 ("All The
Mail's About Tails!").  Theories range from transplantation to
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no "official"
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
(in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with "Deadliest of
the Species" in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving"
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
"creative differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
delay.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
of the "Doomsday" episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

A fair point...

To be honest, I don't remember seeing much of it there either :^)
Note: this is _not_ a complaint; it really doesn't bother me, mainly 
because I know the characters (not necessarily what kind of furry they are 
though :^)), so I don't need extra details in the story to describe them to 
me.  OTOH, stories like Brynne or Human Memoirs on alt.fan.furry, _did_ 
need the extra furry details, because nobody knew the characters (plus they 
don't have the advantage Sonic and TTA do of having a visual basis in the 
cartoon to provide a frame of reference).

RDB, wondering if anybody followed all that mumbling...

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
     /Spaziante
     Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile
evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.



Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
     "Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich &
          Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.
     Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
far and describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is
renouned for his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally & Geoffrey
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
     Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD),
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).




#22 [May 1995]
     "The Return"
     Penders/Spaziante & Harvey M.
     The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with
Children; cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_). 
Sonic & Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics," (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
deactivates "Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
"You owe me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
Spaziante artwork.
     "Tails Knighttime Story,"
     Decesare/Manak & John Dagostino
     As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows"
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
     Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep
reading."  Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
"creative differences" theory in Q7.


Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species": Part 2
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed).
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
if so what does she look like? "Of course...her origin may yet be
told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in "Bloodlines"
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.




#23   [Jun 1995]
     "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
order to save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
which I'm not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
     "Vol-ANT-teer"
     Decesare/Manak
     Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.


Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
the chamber blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred. 
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
     "When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
     Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
     Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
     "Panic in the Sky!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hrair_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
     "Fire Drill"
     Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Must be Nack the Weasel -- check out the SonicGram in
issue #23 for a hint.
     "Lord of the Floating Island"
     Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
     While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25  [Aug 1995]
     "Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
     Story: Mike Gallagher
     Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
     "Way, Way Past Cool"
     Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
     "Fortified"
     Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.





NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.org ?

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original four-part Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
     Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
     Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher & Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2  [Sep 1993]
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.

#3  [Oct 1993]
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4  [Nov 1993]
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.


#5  [Dec 1993]
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6  [Jan 1994]
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7  [Feb 1994]
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8  [Mar 1994]
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
the hall.


#9  [Apr 1994]
     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate eil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10  [May 1994]
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11  [Jun 1994]
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12  [Jul 1994]
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13  [Aug 1994]
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14  [Sep 1994]
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.


#15  [Oct 1994]
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     


#16  [Nov 1994]
     [Summary by Erich Schulman]
     "Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
     "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. "The Mail's About
Tails" (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
from the roboticizer ("Rabbit Deployment," #3).  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.



#17  [Dec 1994]
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.



#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night" (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
     Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
     An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
     Story and art: Scott Shaw!
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

You're not alone.  I do very poorly at video games.  One reason is that I 
tend to analyze rather than trust my instincts (ie, by the time I figure 
out what to do, I'm history).  Another reason is below par hand-eye 
co-ordination.  I've been playing blackjack on my computer for years, and 
I'm getting pretty good at Animal Quest (it's at ftp.hff.rat.org), but 
that's about as far as I can go with games.  There are two more games I 
used to play but had to give them up when I upgraded to a 486 (they go 
too fast now).  I'd like to get the Sonic CD so I can listen to the 
music, but I can't spare the cash now that I've taken the plunge on a new 
printer.

Lately this thread has been strectching the limits of "on-topic"-ness 
with some messages beginning to get into game hints and others having 
little to do with Sonic.

The music on the Sonic CD is "on-topic" because:
  - the CD is merchandise
  - the music enhances the story behind Sonic and the other Freedom Fighters
It's also OK to discuss the lyrics and to compare/contrast lyrics and 
melodies of these songs with other music that may or may not be on the CD.

I can let these threads go by occasionally because the mailing list is 
not too big and tends to keep a pretty good signal to noise ratio.  But 
we still need to remember that this is the Sonic list whose primary focus 
should be on Mobius.

Enough with the lesson.  Let's go back to Knothole.

I'm pretty good at video games. But of course there's always someone better
than me, and it's usually some 15 year old! :-(

I personally hated the Sonic the Hedgehog types of games. I never 
get into the scrollers.
I just liked the Sat. AM series a lot. I mean the stories and characters are
pretty cool I think.

Really?  I LOVED the Sonic series, even if they WERE platform games.  Oh,
and you DID mean platform games when you said "scrollers", right?  Cuz if
you didn't, and you really meant all scrollers...jeez, that would mean you
only like single-screen games like Pong, Pac Man, and the original Donkey
Kong.  8P  Anywayz, I hate to get off the topic of Sonic, but a really
great game I enjoyed and would reccomend is Final Fantasy 3, an RPG for
SNES.  But enough about that!  Back to Sonic...I'd have to say it's one of
my two favorite side-scrollers, although I admit it's not my favorite game.

I was on for a little while at the beginning, but couldn't stay on for 
long because I had to go eat dinner (I live in the Eastern time zone, so 
6pm EST is REALLY 6pm for me.)  Also, I log in via modem.  So, I 
try to restrict my on-line time to times when I can be fairly certain 
that noone's going to try to call us (I couldn't talk my parents into 
getting a second phone line just for my modem).

I'd like to try this again next month.  Some time after 10pm EST would be 
best for me, as I can stay on for as long as I wish then.

(grins)  That tune drives me nuts.  But that's probably because that

I'm not familiar with the game, not having a Game Gear.  (I'm poor!  Pity

I wrote down all your suggestions and am keeping them handy.  I'm

Sorry, I was TWI (typing while insane) at the time...the Sonic club I'm in
has been having some troubles with bashers, and I wasn't overly happy about
it.  That, and the fact that I haven't played it in so long that all I
remembered was the frustration of going through the whole game, only to die
on the last boss time and again...when you listen to the same music for
days in a row, you begin to get annoyed.  8)  I remember now that the
ending theme (where Sonic falls and Tails catches him) was my favorite.

><

Somebody's got to do it!

I'll privately email you a very neat way to finish those two bosses off 
with Tails if you like (Sonic can do it too, but Tails has a little trick 
he can use...)

Ok lets get started:

1.Another meet is planned for Sunday Aug 5th at 6:00pm we are trying
again to get this working.  The following Sunday we are having a
Furtoonia meet the same time. 6pm (That's Eastern time EST)

2.This is off topic, but i should warn you anyway.  There are several virus
scares going around the Internet, such as a Trojan that clames to be a
new version of PKzip 3.0 and a Trasher that clames to be a Doom 2
upgrade patch that upgraes it to 2.0  Be Careful! and sevral Viruses
have been found sent to most of the binaries News Groups.

3.More Sonic rumors. I heard some people on the local BBSes talking
about sonic pictures that have stuff like Tails killing Sonic! and other
bloody and violent pictures. I will try to find these and send them to
the site. I asked about them but they told me it was a secret and
whouldn't tell me.
Also I heard about someone working on a Crossover PC game called Sonic
Kombat. It just a Mortal Kobat like game with the freedom fighters in
it.

4.Also I wanted to know about possibly sending a message to Sega with
everyone's help of course. about including the rest of the freedom
fighters in the next sonic game.  All thy whould do is give each of them
a special power and let you play as them. And also they whould change
Robotnik to look like he does in the comic and show (He's uglier in the
game!)

Ok

     The day Sunday, August 5th doesn't exist (not this year, anyway).  Do 
you perhaps mean Saturday, August 5th or Sunday, August 6th?

     Personally, I'd like to know where those pictures are-So I can avoid 
them!  I have no desire to see my favorite freedom fighters in a 
bloodbath.  This is just my own opinion and is not intended as a flame or 
as an attempt to tell others what they can or can't upload.  Certainly 
though, if you do find those pictures and upload them to a site, a 
warning as to their graphic nature would be in order.  (Some people 
can't view pictures before downloading them).  Also, bear in mind that if 
someone from SEGA were to find those pictures at some site, they may take 
legal action to have it shut down.  (I believe they can do that.)

It's on Prodigy, Video Games Bulletin Board, Sega Clubs topic, subjects
beginning with "Sonic '95"; and there's another branch on the Comics
Bulletin Board, Cartoon/Furry/Humor topic, subjects beginning with "Sonic".
 The basher trouble is that some member went insane and started a bashing
club despite our protests (because we've been through a LOT because of
people who made the mistake of "bashing back"...admittedly, I learned the
hard way that bashing back isn't the answer...).

Cool...I've never been able to beat it with Tails; rarely with Sonic
(without using the Debug code).

There will be a notice of some sort if they are submitted and approved.  
One possibility is that the images/perv directory can be renamed to adult 
with either a README file or with sex and violence subdirectories.  If I 
download those violent files for approve/disapprove purposes, I know I 
won't be keeping them around.  The Freedom Fighters are special to me.  
If asked to help, I'd say "Beam me up, Sally".  And a small group of 
list.subscribers know just a bit more ;-)  I would not want to see the 
Rebel Alliance break down into civil war, or to see them lose the war 
against with Robuttnik.  Speaking of the R.A., if you've received direct 
mail from me lately, check out the full header of my message (you won't 
see this in a list message).

They could try to have it shut down.  It's hard to say if any such effort 
by Sega would succeed in court.  The defence could claim their violent 
pictures are parodies, and the (US) Copyright Act does protect parodies.  
Without seeing those pictures, I can't assess their chances of the court 
agreeing with such a claim.  If you're really interested in this, drop an 
inquiry in misc.legal.  Oops, almost forgot:  Nothing in this message is

(I'm Not even going to try to quote all that but here is my opein. about
the violent pictures.

When I said i whould try to find them it was not for personal gain. i
really don't want to see that myself. thats why i didn't keep the Tails
Doom patch. the only reason I was going to try to find them is because I
thought that someone whould like them or everyone whould want to see
them just wondering about it. The reason is when i read the Message
archives form past months it was weird how everyone was courious about
the perv pictures when they where going around and they wanted to see
them. I was just thinking hte same whould hapen over the violent
pictures. If you think they whould be to bloody for you or you just
plane don't want to see them then I won't bother. I have better things
to do with my online time then serching for that junk! sorry if you
thought the rong thing about me!

I've heard this suggestion before, including the use of a Nicole-screen
for strategic information, etc.  Sounds more palatable than the previous
suggestion.

1. If it's a sonic graphic, and it's ok quality, I will have it available.

2. If it's something that will upset some, I will make a directory for it.
Like perv for the adult pictures, and I'll make a directory for the violent
ones. Maybe I'll call it "blood". I don't maintain the ftp site for just what
I like.

3. SEGA could certainly try to have my site shut down, but I don't think they
would care. If you're not making any money, they usually leave you alone. And
if they had no problem with the homosexual tails/sonic, then I can't see how
they would have a problem with violent pictures.

I wanted to make this first meeting but couldn't shake off some friends 
fast enough (I don't want to be TOO anti-social).  I'll try to make this one.

Aww man.  The X-Rated Sonic/Tails pictures were silly (and mean) but this
just sounds crude.  Count me as one of the 'disinterested'.  I talked to
the guy who made the pictures with Sonic and Knuckles 'doing' Tails and
he said he drew 'em mainly to annoy one particular Sonic fan he knew.

I think the Mortal Kombat parodies ended with 'Pong Kombat' (The only two
paddles and a ball game with special moves and fatalities).  I forget where
it is but its FTP-able for the PC somewhere.  After seeing that one, the
others just don't matter.

A while back Mike Wallis ask people on this list what folks wanted in the 
'next' Sonic game?  I remember alot of the answer centered around adding 
more of the characters from the ABC Sat AM Series and Archie Comic.

I like the idea of a Sonic RPG style game... SEGA could use more RPG games.
[e.g. Sally could use Nicole to display maps but the crew would have to 
  GET to a computer station in order to get certain maps and other info.
  Maybe one objective would be to rescue Antoine?  (and once done he'd be
  able to give the others something or tell others about their next
  objective... stuff like that... heck.. I'm not the game designer :)
]

On a different note.  It was rumored that DIC had begun selling Sonic
animation cells (one of the reasons why the series might have been canceled)
Anyone know where I might be able to find such cells?  I've been to a few 
stores which offer Animation cells (and have seen a couple catalogs) but
so far nothing from Sonic was available.

...please excuse the off-topic post, but I'm trying to forestall umpteen 
zillion requests for the trick...

Robosonic is *very* easy to beat with Tails.  Here's the trick.  As soon 
as you get on screen, before he even comes down, go to the right side of 
the screen and start spindashing to the left (don't actually spindash, 
though).  The trick is, Tails is short enough that when Robosonic buzzes 
its quills, he doesn't get hit.  Count four hits, and on the fourth hit 
roll out (Robosonic will curl into a ball after the fourth hit), then 
jump back over him to the right and repeat.  He'll jet into you (two more 
hits), then jet away; release the spin, and you'll tag him once more.  
Then start spinning for the eighth and final hit.  About 15 seconds.  (:3

Sonic, being taller, has to be more careful.  He can get the first four 
hits the same way, though he has to be far enough left that the spinning 
spines don't touch him, but after that he has to get them the 
old-fashioned way (spindash Robosonic while it dashes) because he's so 
tall.  Still, it's a lot faster to get those first four hits in quickly.

For Robobuttnik, the tactics are the same for each.  Hit it in the chest 
when it pulls its arms back in preparation to jump, then stand in the 
corner.  When the targetting cursor changes to a 'lock-on', step away far 
enough for it to land, hit it in the chest again, and run away before the 
arm missiles launch.  Repeat in the right corner, then start from the 
beginning.  Twelve hits will kill it.  Warning: sometimes you fall 
through Robobuttnik instead of bouncing off, and I don't know why, but if 
you have five or six lives stockpiled, you can take it down no trouble.

Strategies for any other Sonic boss on request.  (:3

Ok here are a few ideas we could work on for the internet. If you could
work on makeing something like this let me know.

1.I wanted to find someone who could program in Pascal and posably help
make an IGM In Game Moud. for LORD Legend of the red Dragon (BBS DOOR) I
am talking about something like Furtoonia's mobious. it whould have a

Dear friends

DJD: Not only don't I own a Sega game product of any kind

     Heck, I don't own any Sega stuff either.  And I've NEVER played any 
"Sonic" game in my life.  

RDB: technically the furries on StH aren't all that furry - I see no animal 
     characteristics in them ala Tiny Toons...

     Neither then would be "TaleSpin", or "Omaha, the Cat Dancer", which both
feature highly anthropomorphized animals with little or no animal character-
istics.  That's one particular branch of furry lit, IMHO, the other featuring
animals with little anthropomorphism living in a human world.  But the serious
tone of StH, "Omaha", and "TaleSpin" are what make fans consider them furry,
IMHO.  
     And I don't think the Tiny Toons are all that furry themselves.  They're
toons first and furries second.

DJD: Not that the technology did them a heck of a lot of good.  They didn't 
     sweat the details (the hand jive, the story-telling technique)

     A couple of weeks back I realized that Robotnik had basically the same
scheme in the "Princess Sally" mini-series as he did in "Sonic and Sally".
But in the mini-series robot Sally came in contact only with new recruits who
did not know her well.

     Violent pics - Personally I don't believe they really exist.  But I'd be
curious to see them if they did.  I don't think I'll like them though, 
especially if they're nothing but gruesome snuff.

     I couldn't make the first IRC meeting because I can't get on campus on
Saturdays.  But the Sunday time is perfect for me.  Looking forward to it.

Sincerely -

Juan F. Lara

Princess Sally -

IMPERIAL NETWORK MESSAGE
FROM: The Master (Hear and Obey)
TO: All Imperial Citizens

Twenty years ago, the government that once wisely ruled this fair land 
was overthrown by the ambitions of an evil man, Dr. Ivo Robotnik.  
Destroying almost all of the monarchy and subsuming the government into 
himself, he mercilessly oppressed the people and the land, his ultimate 
aim seemingly the destruction of the entirety of Mobius.  The only forces 
that would stand against him were small groups of resistance fighters, 
striking at his forces where he least expected it, smashing his cruel 
ambitions and ultimately defeating him in battle, ten years ago this day.

Yet that victory was not without its own cost; as the Freedom Fighters 
celebrated their victory, Robotnik's soldiers were finally able to locate 
their hidden base by tracking the emanations of a legendary stone used in 
the destruction of Doomsday.  The resultant battle was cruel and swift; 
in one stroke, the leader of the resistance, Sally Acorn, was slain, and 
its most powerful fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, was lost, presumed also 
demised.  Without their strong leadership, the Freedom Fighters seemed 
doomed.

Yet in this time of triumph and terror, one man was able to seize the 
reins of power and guide Mobius back to peace and prosperity.  Though the 
records of this time were lost, it is known that the Master was able to 
take control of Robotnik's remaining legacy, amplify it through his own 
genius, and end the last of the evil doctor's abuses.  At last, after ten 
years of benevolent yet firm leadership, the air over Mobitropolis can be 
breathed once more, and the water runs fresh and clean.

It distresses our beloved leader, therefore, to learn that certain fringe
radicals, styling themselves after the heroic Freedom Fighters (now model
citizens of society), have taken it upon themselves to assault his works,
his holdings, and even his very person.  Decrying imaginary abuses, they
seek to destroy all that he has worked so hard to regain for you, his
loyal subjects.  Be alert!  The rebels could be anyway, under any guise,
and you may be the one to catch these dangerous criminals--

*fzzt*

KSDflhkagjkhWMQHLc*(C4Yl!748OLM

*fzzt*

DO NOT BELIEVE THE SMOOTH LIES AND DANGEROUS PROMISES OF THE CREATURE 
THAT CONTROLS THIS LAND!  HE PROMISES FREEDOM WHEN HIS TROOPERS ROAM THE 
STREETS!  VILLAGES THAT DISOBEY HIM ARE BURNED TO THE GROUND, THE 
VILLAGES ROBOTICIZED!  HE ENSLAVES THE MINDS AND WILLS OF THOSE HE CANNOT 
CONTROL THROUGH BRUTE FORCE!  THROW OFF YOUR SHACKLES!  JOIN THE REBEL 
FIGHTERS!  GLORIFY THE *TRUE* LEGACY OF SONIC THE HEDGE--

*fzzt*

--and enjoy this glorious holiday, the tenth anniversary of the ascension 
of our glorious leader, the Master himself!  All hail the Master!

-----

If you managed to slog through all of that (grin), I'm looking for people
who wanna do a Sonic: TNG RPG PBEM (enough acronyms for ya?) It's ten
years after Doomsday, and things are-- different.  Robotnik is gone, Sally
is gone, and the enigmatic figure who calls himself 'the Master' rules
Mobius.  Things are better than when Robotnik ruled, but better is not
good.  Citizens are oppressed by the Empire, sometimes subtly, sometimes
not so subtly.  Monitors and guards are everywhere, ensuring loyalty.  
Still, if someone wants to toe the line and stay within the system, life 
can be fair, and few are willing to risk helping a desperate band of 
criminals.  For those seeking to overthrow the Master and restore Mobius 
to its former glory, these are 'interesting' times...

Please email me if you're interested!  I think you'll enjoy the changes I 
have in store for Mobius...

Hmm, what if I made a game based on the StH Sat AM cartoon and uploaded 
it as freeware.  Since I wouldn't be making money, SEGA might leave me 
alone. :) Nah...  So, has anyone actually written to SEGA about them 
developing a game with the Sat AM characters?  (Not sure why I care, I 
don't even own a SEGA system.)

If you made it freeware, it wouldn't even make it to court.

Hey, I could do that!  I'm just annoyed that I didn't think of it first!
<G> I was working on an IGM for LORD a few months back, but got stuck on
it, but I'm willing to try again!  I've never been on Furtoonia, but I
could try my best to make something Sonic-esque...
