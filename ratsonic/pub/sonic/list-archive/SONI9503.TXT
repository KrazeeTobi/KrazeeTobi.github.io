Considering how many planets there are, it seems inevitable that at least 
one other is supporting life.  Perhaps (probably?) not life as we know 
it, but still life.  Although some out there disagree, no one on Earth 
has encountered extra-terrestrial life, and without a standard for 
comparison, we can't really say what would be life that is not as we know it.

It seems unlikely that another planet in this or another universe would 
have developed both English and French in a form so close to what we know 
-- and that Sonic would even identify Antoine as from the French section 
of Mobius.  For that to hold true, there would have to be a France on 
Mobius with the same language and culture (remember Snively torturing 
Antoine with escargot and margarine?).  That close a parallel is so 
unlikely that Sonic would probably have mean to draw for us a comparison 
we can understand to a place on Mobius quite similar to what we know as 
France.

As for translations, we do hear the voices of Jaleel White, Charlie 
Adler, etc., not the voices of Sonic, Snively, etc.  So maybe those are 
translations after all.  And the other choice would have been subtitles 
(which I don't think would have done much for ABC's ratings).  But then, 
we'll need to track down who on Earth learned their language so that we 
can all learn it too.

There's one more thing to remember about time.  Even on Earth, not 
everyone considers it to be 1995.  There are some cultures who use their 
own calendar and consider the current year to be something else, although 
they do use 1995 when communicating with the rest of the world.

So who says 3730 on Mobius couldn't be 19xx (or even 18xx) on Earth?  It 
all depends on when you want to start counting, and Mobius probably has 
its own special event from not quite 4000 years ago to begin counting from.

And then we can get into the question of whether it takes approximately 
365.25 Earth days or xxx Mobius days for Mobius to revolve once around 
its sun.  Or does it orbit at all?  We know Knothole had a big snowstorm, 
so Mobius probably does tilt on its axis towards/away from its sun.

I never could see a name, but a pig is in Sally's mini-series #1.  But of 
course Sonic isn't, except in the intro and the adverts.  And he could be 
eating one of those artificial 'dogs where probably no one is quite sure 
what the thing is made of.

But as long as you had to bring up a tasteless point....

He may just be eating those who were about to (for whatever reason) 
defect to Robotnik's side.

I guess everyone has a few skeletons in the closet, and Mobius is no 
exception.

Well in a few eppisodes they show Hot Dog stands.... and the chef who 
serves Sonic is a pig. (This leads me to belive that Mobian chili dogs 
aren't made out of pork)

I like the "Happy Fun Fox".  In the Weekday cartoon he looks cute.  And he
fly's.  In the videogames, I like to play Tails most of the time.

I think the Sega guy should see if he could sneak it into the credits of
the next Tails (or Sonic) game.

Ooohhh. Now that's a good idea. Saturday Night Live might try to sue Sega 
for copyright infringemnet though. Probably not.

Does anybody know what network the weekday show is on? I'd like to see it at
least once. And what time too. 
I have cable, so if it's on USA or TBS, I can see it there, if it on.
Or is it independant UHF channels?

Saturday Night Live? What are you talking about? I thought "Happy Fun Fox"

And the pitch:

The HFF phrase is based on an SNL mock commercial for "Super Happy Fun
Ball" -- the joke was that the "commercial" consisted of about 10
seconds of advertisement for a toy ball and about 90 seconds of legal
disclaimers [e.g., not to leave it out of its container, how it's being
used in the Gulf War against Iraq, etc -- which dates the commercial --
and the disclaimer: "Do not taunt Super Happy Fun Ball."].

So much for cultural history,

So it _IS_ an origional idea. Great! I don't think that is infringement. 
Linking Tails to Super Happy Fun Ball is quite a stretch.

I did see that on SNL, but never recalled "Fox" in the name anywhere.. :-)

No, we adapted Happy Fun Fox from a Saturday Night Live comercial parody. 
The orignal was a comercial for Happy Fun Ball. There were about five 
seconds of promtions for the product and about a minute of disclaimers 
including "Happy Fun Ball has been shown to cause cancer in labratory 
animals," "Pregnant women should avoid exposure to Happy Fun Ball," and 
the ominous sounding "Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball."

Which is why SNL probably won't sue. Go ahead and put Happy Fun Fox in 
the credits.

In the SF Bay Area the show is on Channel 44 (a UPN affiliate) at 8:30 in 
the morning.

The week-day afternoon show is syndicated, so "check your locak TV listings."

Here in Atlanta, it comes on the UPN station.

Ok sonic fans, issue #22 is out and it throws more curves the the baseball
strike. First off, A few story idea's have been hinted at. Like how 
tails meet and what happend to sonic's mother. Also, is it possable for our 2
tailed "Happy fun fox" to get his own mini-series? Well, it looks like if a lot
of poeple write in and ask for it, it will happen. Also, they once again give
ages and they say that sonic and sally are about 15 (a bit off from the show.)
They also say that tails is 5 years old. (once again, a bit off from the show
which says his age is 10. What do you all think? I think we should all write to
archie and tell them "YES! We want a tails mini-series." Also, I miss the
corner boxes on the cover of the comic. Who else misses it? Well, thats if for
now. issue #22 just cam out today in chicago so it may not be out everywhere
just yet but keep

I wrote for the weekday 'Adventures of...".  We did the writing for those
about two years ago -- all 64 episodes done in one season.  The weekend
Sonic, I believe, was written over the course of at least a couple of
seasons, and I have to admit, I've only actually watched one or two episodes
from that series.  The story editors of the ABC show didn't want to work with
the syndicated crew (which actually was done first) because they didn't want
to new show to be influenced by ours.

As far as the future of the ABC Sonic, I have no idea.  Haven't been keeping
up with the folks at DiC (I'm a freelancer and have been working elsewhere
the last couple of years.)

Anyway, gotta speed keed!

Check, check, and check.  (Odd thought: anybody know what we should call
the move in the games where Tails emulates Sonic's Spin Dash?  No suitably
cute names occur to me, sadly... except maybe the Happy Fox Ball...)

Sounds like time to add a few items to the Merchandise List.  (:3 Are the
Sonic 3 Happy Meal toys on it?  I have the Tails one, and can describe it
for the interested...

Pity there's only the one to go around.  (:3

Hmm.  None of the above in Knothole, excepting Tails himself, so we dunno...

This brings back unfortunate memories of that Tails spooge pic...  (:3

No comment.  (:3

So close your eyes before going on helifox rides.  (:3

Err, next time take some oxygen with you before going *that* high...  (:3

Acrophobes should not be riding the HFF anyway.  (:3

As this usually precedes his transformation to Super Happy Fun Fox, this
is wise advice.  Those bluebirds are vicious little sods.  (:3

Fortunately, only 'Buttnik has any exposed skin to worry about.  Well, him
and Rotor, but that's already been tested as safe.

No way!  Tails is best at room temperature!  (:3

Probably a subsidiary of Robotnik's mechanical empire.  No wonder they
want you to stick Tails in a cold box.  (:3

Support for the mutation hypothesis?  Or maybe he was bitten by a
radioactive bluebird?  (:3

(image: a couple news reporters getting footage of the smashed city
outside their hotel room.  A noise like a toy helicopter is heard seconds
before a two-tailed fox heaves into view of the window, struggling with a
massive Badnik bomb.  "Which way to 'Botnik's bunker?" he gasps out; upon
getting two directions that agree, he putters off into the distance.)

> Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.

He might cry.  He might pout.  Or he might turn into Super Happy Fun Fox
and have you pecked to death by vicious bluebirds.  (:3

> Happy Fun Ball comes with a lifetime guarantee.

Does that mean if he breaks we can get a new one?  (:3

> Happy Fun Ball!  Accept no substitutes!

Agreed.  (:3

The weekday series is on no network, broadcast or cable.  But many of the 
stations that do carry this *syndicated* series are 
Fox/WB/UPN/independent UHF stations, such as WFLI 53 (UPN) and WXMT 30 
(to be UPN) in my state (Tenn.).  WFLI is the closest station to me which 
does carry it, and they're 75 miles away from me.

WXMT runs it at 6am, so be sure you check your listings thoroughly.  If 
no station in your area carries it, all you can do is beg -- or buy the 
videos.  (You can also try disconnecting the cable, get a good antenna, 
and hope for the best from more distant stations you might be able to 
receive.)

I recalled that commercial parody right away, but I thought the 
similarity was coincidental.  As for the person who commented about 
copyright infringement, I think NBC would wind up with a weak case not 
worth pursuing if Sega were to do this.  I think "Happy Fun Fox" is a 
cool way to describe Tails....

	"Aunt Bunnie! Aunt Bunnie!"
	Bunnie was sitting in her hut, writing. She heard Tails call her and 
she went to look out her window. "What is it, Tails?"
	"Rotor needs your help! He said he needed to lift something heavy in 
his workshop, and he wanted me to get you.
	"Be right there, sugar!" Bunnie smiled, and went outside.

	Inside Rotor's workshop, Sonic, Antoine, Dulcy, and Sally were 
awaiting Bunnie's arrival.
	Bunnie opened the door to Rotor's workshop and stepped in. All was 
quiet. Bunnie turned to ask Tails if he'd seen anything, but he had 
disappeared. She stepped in further.
	"Rotor?...Tails?...Are y'all in here?"
	"SURPRISE!!!"
	Bunnie was shocked.
	Sonic came up to her and put his hand on her robotic shoulder. 
	"Happy Birthday Bunnie!"
	"My stars! I thought everyone forgot about it!" Bunnie exclaimed.
	"How could we forget your Sweet Sixteen?" Sally smiled.
	"I have made you a cake, Bun-nie. It ees zee famous "Cake de Antoine"!
Antoine grinned.
	Bunnie began to cry. "I can't believe y'all went to this trouble!"
	"Don't cry!" Dulcy exclaimed, "We haven't even opened the presents!"
	"Sorry." Bunnie sniffled. Tails came up to Bunnie and handed her a 
good sized box.
	"Open mine first!" Tails barked happily.
	"Sure thing, sugar!" Bunnie said as she started to open it. Inside the
box she found a device.
	"It's a journal, Aunt Bunnie," Tails explained, "Now you don't have 
to write with a pen. All you have to do is talk to it and it prints out what 
you say!"
	"Why, Tails, hon! How'd you make this?" Bunnie wondered.
	"Aunt Sally's been teaching me some things." he smiled.
	"Hey, Bunnie! Open my present next!" Sonic interrupted.
	"Okay, sugarhog." Bunnie grinned as she teared the paper off of the 
flat object. Inside was a beautiful painting of all the Knothole Freedom 
Fighters, clustered by the sliding tree.
	"Why, Sonic! This is beautiful!"
	"I do have other occupations other than being a Freedom Fighter." the 
blue hedgehog grinned.
	She opened Dulcy's next. It was a display of her first expedition 
when she was twelve.
	"Thank you Dulcy!" exclaimed Bunnie.
	"No problem." the dragon said, flapping her wings.
	Sally stood up. "This next present is from Rotor and me." she said as 
she handed a small box to the cybunny.
	Inside the box was a replica of Nicole.
	"Her name is Sarah. She has many of the programs Nicole has, plus a 
few more. She talks in English' too...Try her out!" Rotor smiled.
	"Gosh...what should I ask?" Bunnie whispered.
	"Ask her to display a picture of Robotropolis." Dulcy replied.
	"Sarah, I'd like to see a display of Robotropolis."
	In a voice not as low as Nicole's, she spoke. "One moment, Bunnie."
	Suddenly a display of Robotnik's paradise was shown.
	"Oooh...I could get to like this!" Bunnie giggled.
	"It also has a telecommunicator. This way, if we need to go on a 
mission together, we can still keep in contact." Sally smiled.
	Last was Antoine. "Ta-dah! Zees is a copy of zee recipe book handed 
down in my familee. I want vou to have eet!"
	"Antoine...I don't know what to say..." the rabbit smiled and went up 
to Antoine and kissed him on the cheek. He blushed.
	"Oooh! Well! Would you like a copy as well, my preencess?" Antoine 
grinned hopefully towards Sally.
	"Maybe another time Antoine." she rolled her eyes.
	After everyone was finished they ate Antoine's cake. They danced and 
sang songs sung by the citizens of Mobotropolis many years before.
	Pretty soon, everyone was in his or her own hut and fast asleep. 
Night had seemed to have come much faster when they were having fun.
	Bunnie was awoken by the cooing of the messenger bird, summoned by 
Uncle Chuck. She called for the bird and it landed on her windowsill. She 
opened the container on it's leg and read the note.
	"Oh my stars!" she gasped.
	Bunnie ran over to Sally's bed.
	"Wake up, Sally-girl!" the rabbit exclaimed as she lightly tapped the 
sleeping princess' shoulder.
	Sally was up in a second. "Bunnie, what's wrong?" Bunnie handed her 
the note.
	Sally's eyes fled over the paper.
	"Oh my gosh!" Sally gasped. She and Bunnie then got dressed and ran 
to Sonic's hut. Bunnie decided to take Sarah with her. A groggy hedgehog 
opened the hut's door.
	"Sonic!" Bunnie cried, "Robotnik wants to make me his queen!"
	Sonic lit up. "WHAT?!"
	"Uncle Chuck just sent us this letter, it explains everything." Sally 
told him.
	"Why Bunnie?"
	"I don't know..."
	Suddenly Bunnie's legs and arm emitted a soft yellow glow.
	"Wh-what's happening to me?" Bunnie cried. It was then when she ran 
out of the hut towards the meadow.
	Sonic and Sally ran after her.
	"Bunnie!" Sonic yelled.
	"Help me Sally! I can't control my legs!" she wailed.
	Sonic had caught up next to Bunnie and would've grabbed her, but he 
remembered that her robotic parts gave her the strength she had, and Sonic 
didn't want to mess with that power.
	"What could be causing this, Sal?" Sonic asked.
	"Maybe, when the roboticization process took place, a homing device 
was planted in Bunnie. It didn't function until now, when Robotnik wanted 
her." Sally explained.
	"So, you're sayin' that ol' Bullethead planted something in Bunnie?" 
Sonic translated.
	"Exactly."
	"Then how do we get rid of it?" Sonic questioned.
	"I don't know. One thing I do know, is that we should see Uncle Chuck 
as soon as we can. He'd know more about this than we do." Sally replied.
	"But what about Bunnie?"
	"We'll let her go into Robotnik's domain, and I'm sure that's where 
she's headed, and we'll have her play robot with Robotnik himself and then 
we'll take her off."
	"Just hope he doesn't do a brainscan, Sal."
	"That's what I hope." Sally then yelled towards Bunnie, "Bunnie! 
We're letting you go to Robotnik. You'll be safe, don't worry. Anyway he 
want's you there. What I want you to do though is to keep contact with us 
through Sarah, but you have to act as if you're under mind control with 
Robotnik You've got it?"
	"I'll try Sally-girl. Just promise y'all will bring me back soon." 
Bunnie told the two as she ran towards Robotropolis.
	"Freedom Fighter's Honor, Bunnie!" Sonic grinned.
	"We'll be back Bunnie! I Promise." Sally reassured her, and with that,
Sonic and Sally headed off to Uncle Chuck.

*   *   *

	"So, do you know anything on this, Sir Charles?" Sally asked, politely.
	"Why, yes. I remember, before Sonic brought me to reality, an urge to 
take me back to Robotropolis whenever I had strayed. Especially that time I 
tried to kidnap Antoine and little Tails, it was really strong then. Let me 
run a certain program I created on installations and programmings of the 
roboticization process. I wrote everything that could possibly happen when an 
individual is being roboticized." Uncle Chuck then proceeded to tap around 
the keyboard for a second before finding what he needed. A big display was 
shown on the monitor.
	"Whoa! Mondo complicated, Unc!" Sonic exclaimed.
	"Entirely, but this is what we need to know." Uncle Chuck explained. 
Sally ripped out Nicole and had her copy the entire file.
	"File copy completed, Sally." she said.
	"I'll try to find out more about Robotnik's plans, but now I have to 
get back to my station. They'll suspect of something if I'm not there." Uncle 
Chuck turned to his nephew, "I love you,Sonic."
	"I love you too, Unc...C'mon, Sal'! It's time to get loose and juice."
	"Bye, Uncle Chuck. Thank you." Sally smiled as she hopped in Sonic's 
arms. In a half-second they were out of there.

*   *   *

	"Ah..." sighed Robotnik, "It worked."
	Bunnie droned her voice and stared into nothingness. "Awaiting orders,
sir."
	"I will not be giving you any orders, my dear girl. You...will be my 
queen."
	Bunnie cringed on the inside upon the thought of having to live with 
Robotnik the rest of her life.
	Snively spoke up.
	"Sir, shall I do a brainscan on her?"
	"No need Snively, the device has done it's job. Take her to the 
holding cell. There we will have her spruced up." Robotnik explained.
	"Contacting Escort, sir." replied Snively.
	"Good," thought Bunnie, "They think I'm brainwashed. Sally will be 
glad to hear that."
	Two Swat-bots then picked up Bunnie by the arms and took her to her 
cell.

*   *   *

	Sonic reached the main entrance to the Death Egg in about three 
seconds. Sally let go of Sonic's shoulders and messed with the control panel 
located to the side of the door. In a minute the doors opened. Sonic grabbed 
Sally and rushed into an open air vent. 
	Soon they found themselves over the holding cells.  Sally removed the 
vent cover and jumped inside an empty cell. With the door open, they began 
their search for their friend.

*   *   *

	Back at Knothole, Rotor was becoming restless.
	"Dulcy, where could they be?" he asked the dragon.
	"Beats me, Rotor, but as long as Sonic's with them I wouldn't count 
on any trouble."
	"I zeenk they abandoned us!" Antoine exclaimed.
	"Get real, Tony!" Dulcy scolded.
	"I wish Sonic had told me about it, I would've gone." Tails muttered.
	"C'mon Tails, I'll play air tag with ya!" Dulcy tried to cheer up the 
little cub.
	"Okay." he said, and he and Dulcy flew off.

*   *   *

	Inside her holding cell, Bunnie was being dressed by Swat-bots into a 
very ugly red, yellow, and black dress. The bots were finally finished with 
her preparations and left the cell. Bunnie waited a good minute or two to 
pick up Sarah.
	"Sarah, locate Sally and link up the communication mode." Bunnie 
whispered.
	"Locating...individual found. Setting up communication." droned Sarah.
	Sonic and Sally were passing the western cell blocks when Sally 
received the message.
	"Bunnie! Are you alright?" exclaimed Sally.
	"Couldn't be better Sally-girl. It's just this dress looks 
disgusting!" Bunnie replied.
	"I must admit, Robotnik does have bad taste!" Sonic intervened.
	Bunnie heard the hedgehog. "Hiya sugarhog!"
	"Hang in there Bunnie, we're almost there."
	"Okay--Oh my stars! Someone's coming." Bunnie gasped.
	The transmission was lost.
	"Sonic, we've got to do something." Sally persisted.
	"Wait a Sonic Second..." Sonic thought for a moment, "...Yeah! C'mon 
Sal, we're outta here."
	"Where are we going?" Sally questioned.
	"Trust me." was all that Sonic said.
	"I hate it when you say that..."

*   *   *

	"Ah, my queen." Robotnik said as he watched Bunnie standing there 
holding Sarah, "You've duped us all."
	"I wonder why it was so easy, you cottonball!" Bunnie snapped.
	"Oh but it wasn't...for you see, " he paused dramatically, "I heard 
your whole conversation with the Princess."
	"How?"
	"You didn't think I wasn't cautious, did you? You see, all the cells 
are built with tiny microphones installed in the walls. That way, no prisoner 
can plan their escapes out loud."
	"What if they don't talk?"
	"That's what these are for." Robotnik said, pointing to a 
surveillance orb floating above him.
	"You're gonna pay for this Robotnik!" Bunnie threatened.
	"I don't see how. I can only wonder why your little friends' haven't 
arrived yet. Have they abandoned you?" 
	"In your dreams, butterball."
	Robotnik turned to his two Swat-bots. "Take her away."

*   *   *

	Sonic arrived at Knothole in three seconds. He then proceeded to tell 
the Freedom Fighters what had happened to Bunnie.
	"That's horrible! Not even a day after her birthday and she's being 
tortured." cried Rotor.
	"I'll come with you Sonic, you might need my help." Dulcy said.
	"I'm coming too!" barked Tails. Sally began to hesitate but quickly 
realized that Tails was now one of the Freedom Fighters. Officially.
	"Dulcy, you take Sally and Tails. Rotor, I'm gonna need your help."
	"Whatever you say Sonic." Rotor smiled.

*   *   *   

	Back in the Death Egg, Robotnik's Swat-bots were leading Bunnie to 
the Roboticizer.
	"Let me go, you wire-brains!" Bunnie struggled.
	Suddenly Sonic burst into the room with Rotor on his shoulder.
	"HEDGEHOG PRIORITY ONE! HEDGEHOG PRIORITY ONE!" droned the Swat-bots 
and dropped Bunnie on the floor. Rotor ran and picked her up.
	"Nice dress, Bunnie." Rotor smirked.
	"Can it!"
	Ten more bots filled the room and began to chase after Sonic. Sonic's 
plan was to lead the bot patrol to outside towards Dulcy where she would 
blast them away with a breath of fire. Rotor's job was to take a dummy of 
Bunnie, place it in the Roboticizer, and activate it.
	Bunnie quickly got out of her dress and put it on the dummy.
	"Robotnik's really gonna be steamed when he finds this in my place!" 
Bunnie smiled.
	"Ol' chrome dome won't know the difference until he comes in to check 
on you." Rotor explained.
	Bunnie paused as Rotor pushed some buttons on the Roboticizer, "Say, 
sugar, who's plan was this anyway?"
	"Tails'." replied Rotor.
	Bunnie smiled. "He's all grown up, isn't he?"

*   *   *

	Outside Dulcy was finishing off the remainder of the bot patrol. 
Tails and Sally were working on destroying the power generator.
	"We need to shut it down, then Dulcy can destroy it." Sally told 
Tails as he stood next to the grid-interlock.
	Tails then set to finding the password to shut down the system.
	"Got it, Aunt Sally!" barked Tails, proudly.
	"Good job honey! This should shut down Robotnik for a few days!" 
Sally smiled.

*    *    *

	The Roboticizer remained on-line, due to a back-up generator. Inside, 
the dummie was ready and roboticized. Bunnie and Rotor had already left when 
Robotnik showed up.
	"Ah, I see we're--" Robotnik gasped, "Where in the-? SECURITY! Search 
the area! I want that girl!" Robotnik stood there, steaming, "When I do find 
her, she'll pay greatly before I roboticize her..."

*   *   *

	As Rotor and Bunnie were escaping, Rotor decided ask Bunnie some things.
	"Do you have any idea why he wanted you as a queen?" he asked.
	"I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with my strength. 
Either that, or he would have tried to emotionally scar Sally."
	"Good point. Man, Robotnik sure pick the wrong rabbit to mess with!" 
smiled Rotor.
	"Sugar, I bet you say that to all the girls!" Bunnie blushed.
	Soon they were outside and Sally ran up to her best friend.
	"Bunnie! I'm so glad you're okay!" Sally smiled and gave Bunnie a hug.
	Suddenly swarms of bots surrounded everyone.
	"Oh no!" gasped Tails.
	Sonic turned to his little fox friend. "Wanna help me kick some 
bot-butt?"
	"Yeah!" he smiled and flew into the air.
	Sonic thrashed through the ground patrol, while Tails eluded the sky 
patrol into running into each other, smashing them to the ground.
	Rotor, Sally, Bunnie and Dulcy took this time to escape.
	When most of the bots had vanished, Sonic motioned for Tails to come 
down and land. Doing so, Tails grabbed onto Sonic's shoulders and then they 
were out of there.

*   *   *

	"Oh my stars, that was the most peculiar thing that cue-ball has ever 
done!" gasped Bunnie as she sat with her friends by the ring pool.
	"You're right, Bunnie. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life. 
He's got Snively, what else does he need?" Sonic grinned.
	"Taste, sugar, definately taste."
	They all laughed.
	"Rotor, there's one thing I wanna ask you." smiled Bunnie,"Do you 
really think that he messed with the wrong rabbit."
	"Of course." said Rotor.
	"Thank you, sugar. To this cybunny, that compliment meant a lot."
	"In what way?" asked Sally.
	"Well, I just feel helpless and all, with me bein' partially 
Roboticized. I need a good compliment every once and a while. It's weird 
being different. As a matter of fact, I don't know why he didn't choose a 
normal girl." replied Bunnie.
	"Bunnie, you are normal. It's not your appearance that matters." 
Dulcy piped in.
	Bunnie paused for a moment and then looked up at Dulcy. "You're right 
sugar-dragon."
	"We all love ya."
	Bunnie was startled to hear this. It hadn't come from Sonic, Sally, 
Rotor, Dulcy, or Tails. It had come from Sarah.
	"What the hoo-haw is goin on here?"
	Sally giggled. "I told Nicole to make her say that!"
	"Sally-girl! You scared the hair off me! For a second there, I 
thought that Sarah here was alive!" laughed Bunnie.
All was well in Knothole.

		THE END!

The Seminar
written by Holl-B Kraft

I'd just like to tell everyone that I hope they like my story. This is really 
hard to do, especially considering that I'm only a Sophomore in high school.
I'd also like to say that this contains a little romance, but not from the 
individual you may be thinking of.
If anyone would like to send me suggestions on stories to write, please mail 
me either here on AOL, or my internet address (cvev69b@prodigy.com)

	Sonic was waiting by the Power Ring pool with Sally. A new mission 
had come up, and this time, it didn't involve Robotnik.
	There was a Freedom Fighters seminar coming up north of the Great 
Forest, and they were almost ready to go.
	Everyone was leaving Knothole to attend this seminar. What Sally and 
the other Freedom Fighter groups were planning on, was building an 
underground system between all of the Villages, providing easy transport and 
shipment of supplies.
	"Okay Sonic, how many power rings do we have?" Sally wondered.
	"Thirty."
	"Good. That should give us enough power for weeks. Ready to go?" 
Sally smiled.
	"Yup. Let's go gather everyone up."
	Sonic and Sally  went back to Knothole to help with the final 
preparations.

	"Boy, I sure hope this works," sighed Dulcy, "My back is going to 
kill me!"
	Dulcy was loaded with all the supplies on her back, and the rest was 
being carried in the cruiser.
	Bunnie helped as much as she could with her robotic strength. At the 
seminar, there was going to be a lecture on de-roboticization, and she was 
definitely going to that. As was Uncle Chuck.
	Tails had packed up all of his sneakers, socks, and gloves, as did 
his mentor, Sonic. He was going to a lecture for the newer Freedom Fighters.
	"This is going to be so much fun, isn't it Sonic?" Tails smiled.
	"Remember Tails, this seminar isn't just for fun. We need to learn 
while we're there too!" Sonic reminded the bouncy little fox.
	"Okay Sonic." he replied.
	Sally gathered everyone up.
	"Freedom Fighters, and Freedom Fighters-to-be, this is going to be 
one of the most important things that you do in your entire lifetime. 
Robotnik may be gone, but we still need to stay fit and alert. Sonic and I 
have tried our best to find as many Roboticized individuals as possible. With 
the help of Sir Charles Hedgehog, we've been able to bring them out of the 
trance and let them make their own decisions." Sally stepped off to the side 
and brought out a Roboticized mouse. Her eyes were red, yet she was able to 
have her own will. She stepped out into the crowd.
	"This is Tabitha," said Sally, "She's the first person after Uncle 
Chuck to have been brought to her senses. So far, we've been able to restore 
thirty Roboticized individuals back to their senses."
	The Knothole Freedom Fighters took this time to start cheering.
	As soon as everyone had settled down, Tabitha spoke up.
	"I've been Roboticized for five years now. When I was ten, I went on 
mission with some of the southern Freedom Fighters only to be captured by 
Robotnik. The first mission I went on was my last, but let me tell you, I've 
been wanting to destroy that goon ever since I was four! FREEDOM FIGHTERS 
FOREVER!!" she concluded. The crowd began to cheer more.
	"Now everyone, it's very important that you check in with the group 
you've been assigned. When you hook up with your group, you will undergo a 
vigorous training session. After this has been completed, you will then go to 
your lectures. Now, are we ready?" Sally shouted.
	"YEAH!" came her reply.
	"Then here we go!"

	"Lupe! It's great to see you again!" smiled Sally.
	"And you as well." the gray wolf smiled.
	"I've never seen so many Freedom Fighters in all my life!" Sally 
exclaimed.
	"I know, it is wonderful." Lupe replied.
	Suddenly Bunnie ran up to Sally.
	"You wanted to talk to me, Sally-girl?" she asked.
	"Yes Bunnie, I did. Have you seen Rotor? I need his help. We're 
building a tunneling machine and I need him." Sally explained.
	"Hmmm...I haven't seen him all day! Where in the world did he get off 
to, you suppose?" 
	"I think I saw him with Sonic." said Lupe.
	"Do you know where they were going?" asked Sally.
	"I'm really not sure, but I think they went into the forest for a 
walk." the wolf explained.

	"So Rote, what's up?" Sonic asked his friend as they walked a trail.
	"I don't know, to tell you the truth. Although....ah.......never mind
... forget  I mentioned it." Rotor said uneasily.
	Sonic stopped dead in his tracks. "Rotor! You know you can tell me 
anything. Other than Tails and Uncle Chuck, we're the only sane guys here."
	"But what about Antoine?"
	"I said 'sane' Rotor, not 'insane'. Now really, what's up?"
	"Okay. Well, the thing is..........I'm very lonely........." Rotor 
whispered.
	"Lonely?" Sonic repeated, looking confused.
	"Yeah, lonely. My family's been Roboticized and I just feel left out. 
Now that my workshop is gone, I feel even worse...d- do you know what's wrong 
with me?" Rotor asked.
	"I know exactly how you feel Rotor. You've gotta understand, I've had 
to live with out my uncle for eleven years. Uncle Chuck is the only family 
I've got. Don't worry about it. You wanna know why? We're your family Rotor, 
and we care about cha a lot! We'll find your folks Rotor. Someday." Sonic 
smiled.
	"Thanks Sonic."
	"Just one more question, bud. Why did this come up all of a sudden?"
	"Oh...today's my parent's anniversary."
	Sonic didn't reply.

	"I'd like to welcome all of you new Freedom Fighters to this lecture. 
First order of business is the training session!" declared Bunnie, as she 
paced the stage. Sally then stood up.
	"As you know, Robotnik is gone, and that means the battle is over 
right?...Wrong. We need to rise above ourselves and begin to exceed the 
limits of advanced civilization. We, as Freedom Fighters, have the power to 
prepare for any situation."
	"Now we're not saying that Robotnik will ever be back," continued 
Uncle Chuck, "but we are saying that we need to keep in shape."
	"So, in case we ever get attacked by anyone, we'll be up to it! Are 
we ready?" Sally asked.
	The crowd cheered.
	"Good! Now, if you are a new Freedom Fighter, go visit..." she 
trailed off.
	Rotor stood behind the stage by himself. No one saw him except 
Bunnie. She quietly left the stage to see what was wrong.
	"Hiya sugar." she smiled as she approached him.
	"Hello Bunnie." he replied.
	"Aw, now, Rotor, hon, what the hoo-haw is goin on here? You've been 
disappearing constantly, and we can't even find you! Now, sugar, you know 
you can tell me anything. I'm all ears." Bunnie giggled.
	Rotor cracked a tiny smile. "Alright, here goes." He then proceeded 
to tell Bunnie about how lonely he was and how he was depressed. Bunnie sat 
there and listened to every word. When he was finished, Rotor let out a big 
sigh.
	"Aw, Rotor, you should've told us! It ain't good when you hide your 
feelin's!" Bunnie exclaimed.
	Just then, Bunnie heard Dulcy calling her.
	"I've gotta go, sugar. I hope you feel better." Bunnie then got up, 
pecked Rotor on the cheek, and walked away slowly.

	"Where were you Bunnie?" asked Dulcy.
	"I was talkin to Rotor, he's havin some problems."
	"Oh." was all Dulcy said.
	When the silence was broken, it was because of Bunnie, "Whad y'all 
need me for, Dulcy-girl?"
	"Rosie's cooked up some lunch. Wanna get Rotor?" Dulcy asked politely.
	"No, let him be alone for awhile. He needs to think."

	Meanwhile, in the destroyed Robotropolis, Snively began to gather up 
his newest patrol of Swat-bots.
	To no one in particular, he said, "This will be the best attack ever 
planned!"
	He turned to a Swat-bot.
	"Is the ship ready?"
	"Ready, sir." it droned.
	"Good..."

	"HEEEEEE-YAH!" cried Tails as he demonstrated his Kung-Fu to his 
friends.
	"Wow! That was neat Tails!" said a little skunk named Nina.
	"Thank you. Bunnie's been teaching me a lot more lately. I almost got 
my white sash!"
	The little skunk walked over and talked to him face-to-face.
	"You're cute." was all she said. Nina then turned around and walked 
back to the crowd of eight, nine, and ten-year-olds.
	Tails just stood there, his mouth hung open.
	Someone shouted from the crowd. "Do a flying kick again, Tails."
	"Uh, yeah...flying kick..." he stuttered.
	"What's wrong, Tails? Are you tired?" asked Nina.
	"No...it's just-"
	Tails was cut off by Sonic.
	"Hiya T2! Watcha up to?" Sonic questioned.
	"He was showing us some of his Kung-Fu, Sonic, sir." Nina said.
	"Sir? Now, Nina! Call me Sonic." he grinned.
	"I, uh, ohhhh...." Tails suddenly fainted.
	"Whoa! Tails! What's wrong?" Sonic gasped.
	"I think he's just a little tired, Sonic." grinned the little skunk.

	Bunnie and Sally sat in their tent.
	"Have you talked to Rotor yet, Sally-girl?" Bunnie asked.
	"Why no, what's wrong?" Sally wondered.
	Bunnie then related the story to the princess.
	"Poor Rotor." Sally sighed as she brushed away a stray tear.
	"What's the matter, sugar?"
	"Well, I remember the times with my father, and-" Sally began to cry 
on Bunnie's shoulder.
	"Don't cry Sally," said Bunnie, "you'll rust my arm!" Bunnie giggled.
	Sally laughed.
	"You know what, Bunnie? I'm gonna go over to Rotor and tell him how 
much I'm hurting. I'll tell him he's not alone. In fact," Sally slid off the 
bed and started to shuffle through her pack, "I'll make him some hot 
chocolate." she said, showing Bunnie the packet of cocoa.
	"That's good, Sally-girl. You are the sweetest friend I've got."

	Tails slowly began to awaken.
	"Wh- where am I?" he whispered.
	"You're back in our tent, big guy. I heard about what Nina said. Are 
you all-right?" Sonic asked.
	"Yeah...I guess so."
	"Ya know, your ol Aunt Sal used to do that to me when I was your 
age." Sonic grinned.
	"Really?" Tails wondered.
	"Sure thing. She was just flirting."
	"Flirting? What's that?" Tails asked as he propped himself up on his 
cot.
	"It's a kinda hint from a girl that she likes you." Sonic informed.
	"EWWW! That's disgusting." Tails said, gagging.
	"Yeah, I know, it's pretty harsh. You'll learn to like it someday, 
though."
	"Not me, Son. I'll NEVER like that!"
	"That's what I said Tails, and now I got Sal!" Sonic replied.
	"Well, I don't like Nina."
	"Have you even tried to start a conversation with her?" Sonic quipped.
	"Well...um.....no...." Tails quieted.
	"Then how do you know you don't like her?"
	"I...I just don't! She's a girl!" Tails exclaimed.
	"That's a reason?" Sonic smiled. He liked what was happening. What 
was happening to Tails, had once happened to him when he was ten.
	"I guess not."
	"Look, Tails. I'll be honest with ya. Nina's a nice girl. She 
obviously thinks you're good looking from all that training you're doing. 
I don't she one reason why she was silly to have said what she did."
	"Really?" Tails asked his mentor.
	"Serious."
	"Okay...," Tails said in a very low voice, "I guess I can talk to her."
	"That's my pal! Now come on, we need some help with the Tunneler." 
replied Sonic. He then helped the fox up and took him outside.

	"Rotor?" Sally called into the walrus's tent.
	"Yeah?" came a reply.
	"I brought some hot chocolate. Do you want some?"
	"Okay." answered Rotor.
	"I came to talk for awhile," said Sally, "about my father."
	"Your father?" Rotor said in disbelief.
	"Yes. I came to tell you that you're not alone. I hadn't seen my 
father for over eleven years. After I went in the void, I found out that I 
can never be with him again. You are fortunate Rotor. You can find your 
parents, and when you do, you can have some chance of de-roboticizing them. 
I, on the other hand, will never see my daddy again." Sally quietly sipped 
her hot chocolate as a tear slowly ran down her cheek.
	"Oh, Sally. I'm really sorry. I never realized..."
	"Rotor,  I'm not saying that your mourning in vain, but what I am 
saying is, appreciate the family you have. We're always here, Rotor. Always." 
and with that, Sally left the tent.

	"Clear out everyone!" shouted Bunnie as Dulcy began her landing lessons.
	Dulcy suddenly took to air.
	"This is great! I can actually feel a perfect landing coming up." 
Dulcy smiled.
	Bunnie had her fingers crossed. "Good luck, sugar-dragon!"
	Dulcy circled over the meadow a few times before she went in to land. 
When she did, it wasn't very pretty. She ended up falling on her stomach and 
scraping her chin on the ground. Bunnie ran over to her.
	"Are you all right, Dulcy?" she panted.
	"OOOOOoooooh....thanks ma.......I'm fine........" she warbled.
	"Wanna try it again?" Bunnie asked.
	Dulcy cleared her head by shaking it side-to-side. "No...I think I'll 
work on it later. It's starting to hurt!"

	Nina sat by the lake with her friends. Tails came up to her and sat 
next to her.
	"Hi." he said.
	Nina's friends got up and left, sensing that they wanted to talk 
privately.
	"Hi Tails. I'm sorry." Nina said.
	"For what?" Tails wondered.
	"Well," the little skunk slumped, "I made you faint, and I probably 
embarrassed you in front of everyone!"
	"I wasn't embarrassed, just shocked." Tails told her.
	"I'm glad, because I meant what I said." blushed Nina.
	Tails became nervous. "Um, Nina, that's what I wanted to talk about."
	"Yes?"
	"Well, I think you're very nice and everything, but..." Tails 
suddenly began to stammer.
	"It's okay Tails, I know what you want to say." smiled Nina.
	"You do?"
	"Yup. Don't worry, I understand. That's what all guys are like." Nina 
then proceeded to kiss Tails on the cheek. "Now, I was wondering, can you 
teach me to fly with my tail?"
	Tails just fainted.

	"C'mon Sal, I'm bored!" cried Sonic.
	"We're not going back to Robotropolis. Or what's left of it."
	"But Sal, I wanna go check to see if there are any others who are 
still roboticized."
	"No. Sonic, we destroyed everything. Nothing is left there!" Sally 
exclaimed.
	"Aw, Sal, it's just that I am so bored without ol Melonhead chasin 
my tail!" said Sonic.
	"Sonic, we've got a seminar going here. We can't just leave! I said 
no and that's final! Royal order!" Sally shouted at the hedgehog.
	Sonic sighed and left the tent.

	"How many Swat-bots do we have totaled?" demanded Snively.
	"Approximately 500, sir." droned the Tech-bot.
	"How many Worker-bots?"
	"Eleven hundred sir."
	"Do you have any idea as onto how long it will take to build up the 
army that we once originally had?" Snively wondered.
	"Completion will probably take place this fall, sir." the bot reported.
	"Try to increase production. We must have as much as a chance as we 
did before."
	"Yes sir."

	Uncle Chuck had already tried out the tunneler finding that it didn't 
work. What the problem was, was that there were too many existing tunnels 
from the Doomsday pods. The only choice was to follow up throughout those 
already existing tunnels, and to try to find connections between villages. 
Uncle Chuck went down into the ground with Tabitha and a couple other 
Roboticized individuals, who were prized for their unique night vision.
	They proceeded down the tunnels for an hour before stopping. Uncle C
huck insisted that the band stop because her was almost sure he heard 
something. He called for Tabitha to come and confirm his suspicions, since 
she had extremely sensitive hearing.
	"I think I do hear something, Sir Charles. It's very muffled though."
	"Good girl, Tabby. Now do you think you could make it out if we got 
closer?" wondered Uncle Chuck.
	"I don't know. I'm pretty sure it's nothing though."
	"You're probably right. We're probably very near to the hot springs." 
sighed Uncle Chuck.
	"Let's go to the left, Sir Charles." said a raccoon.
	"Lead on, Alvin."

	Little did the Freedom Fighters know, the sound that Uncle Chuck had 
heard was the working of bots, trying to build up a wall from the main tunnel 
at Robotropolis, therefore making it impossible for anyone to crawl through 
and sabotage.

	Later that day, Uncle Chuck's squad made it to the surface. They had 
found that they had emerged in the meadow near Knothole.
	"We did it!" smiled Uncle Chuck.
	They then started making their way back through the tunnels placing 
more markers and light systems to show where they had been.
	The group made it back to the seminar by nightfall.

	"Well, did you guys make it?" Sally asked anxiously.
	"Yep! We marked the tunnels and lighted them too." replied Tabitha.
	"Alright! Good job you guys!"
	"Now what, Sally?" asked Uncle Chuck.
	"Well, we start sending supplies and build up our forces. I'm sure 
Dulcy will be glad to hear this. Now we don't need her to fly the supplies 
in!" said Sally.
	"Well, I guess we'd better get to bed. We have to pack up and go home 
tomorrow."
	"See ya tomorrow." said Tabitha.
	"G'night."

	Back at Knothole, Sonic was helping Sally unpack.
	"Sal?"
	"What?" asked Sally.
	"What...what if Robotnik isn't gone?...What if he...he made an 
identical robot of himself to fool us..." Sonic stammered.
	"Sonic! That's absurd!" Sally exclaimed.
	"Yeah, I guess...but you never know..." replied Sonic.
	"We destroyed him!" Sally informed him.
	"Oh yeah? Then why wasn't Snively with him?" Sonic shot.
	"He must have been in the Death Egg when we destroyed it. Either 
that, or he was in the ship, we just didn't see him. Either way, he's gone, 
and so is ChromeDome himself!"
	"Maybe you're right." Sonic caved in.
	Just then, Tails walked in, holding Nina's hand.
	"Well hello Tails, hi Nina." Sally said in a pleasant voice.
	"Hi Aunt Sally! Hi Sonic!" said Tails with a smile.
	"Hi Princess Sally, hello Sonic." piped in Nina.
	"Hey Tails, what's up?" asked the blue hedgehog.
	"Um, well, I just wanted to ask if I can take Nina with me to our 
Secret Place." Tails asked.
	"Our Secret Place?! That's only for the two of us!" exclaimed Sonic.
	"I didn't mean ours Sonic," Tails smiled, "I meant ours." he said, 
motioning to Nina.
	Sonic and Sally exchanged surprised glances.
	Sally broke out of her confusion to ask, "Is it in the Great Forest?"
	"Yes, Aunt Sally. It is."
	"Okay. You can go." Sally smiled.
	"C'mon Nina!" barked Tails.
	"Okay! Bye Sonic! Goodbye Princess Sally!" said Nina, as Tails 
grabbed her hand and led her out of the room.
	As soon as they were out of hearing distance, Sonic spoke up.
	"Looks like Tails is hooked too!"
	"Too?" said Sally suspiciously.
	"Yeah!" Sonic smiled.
	"Well, Sonic Hedgehog," said Sally, "I think we better go unpack 
Tails things while he's gone."
	"You're right. Let's go." Sonic replied.
	As they walked out, Sonic put his arm around Sally.

	"How were your seminars, Rotor?" asked Bunnie.
	"Good! I learned some new things on androids. I'll need 'em since 
that mess up on Ro-Becca." he smiled.
	"Are you feeling any better, sugar?" Bunnie asked with sincerity
	"Yeah. Sally really woke me up."
	"Well, I'm glad you're all right." Bunnie paused, "Wanna come over to 
my place for some tea?"
	"Well...sure...I guess."
	"Oh good! I've been wantin' to try out Antoine's cookbook. It's got a 
whole section devoted to teas! C'mon, sugar."
	Rotor got up and followed Bunnie to her hut, where she then put on a 
kettle of water. 
	When the tea was ready, Bunnie and Rotor sat down and had a long 
serious chat about their childhoods, and how badly they missed their 
families. It was late when they finally finished.
	"Thanks for the talk, Rotor. I've been wanting to get the same things 
off of my lil' ol' mind." Bunnie said.
	"Anytime...well, goodnight, Bunnie." said Rotor
	"Goodnight, sugar."


THE END!  ;)

That's because all cartoons are made by _humans_. And as inhabitants of
Earth we can only refer to things we know, our society, our problems with
polluting the environment, our social structure and the like. Of course
everyone tries to make the world in the cartoons a little better and a
more interesting place to live than the world we know. That's because
there is magic in the cartoon or a society of different species that live
together in peace.

There have been a lot of postings about the location of Mobius. To my
opinion the best suggestion would be that Mobius is an alternate earth of
another universe/dimension, inhabited by intelligent animals instead of
humans. This would explain all the parallels in speech (English, France)
or food (Chili Dogs). And because it's an _alternate_ earth there can
also be magic there.

That's the best reason to convince anyone that Mobius is no future Earth.
This suggestion sounded a little strange anyway...

Well, in the Furry comics I've read there are some animals that have
evolved into intelligent, human-like beings, but there are also others
that are just 'normal' animals (like chickens or cows). Maybe its the
same with Mobius.

There was also a pig in the Sonic mini-series #1 (one of the Royal Guards),
but that was one of Robotniks androids which had a self destruct mechanism
implemented. Sonic threw him out of Knothole just in time...

At least he should use lots of ketchup, then.

Or maybe they are cannibals? Freedom Fighters by day, ravaging beasts by

Maybe it would be better to tell them to do something against the lousy
artwork in their comic. Say what you want, Sonic just doesn't look in
the comic like he does in the SatAM cartoon. But on the other hand, it
seems that I'm all alone with this opinion.

Take it easy

     Since I'm a proponent of the Mobius-As-Another-
World theory, it should come to no surprise that my
guess would be they eat native wildlife.  Something
looking vaguely like the dragons or the little birds
they use to carry messages, I'd imagine.  We haven't
exactly been treated to much else in the way of animal
life.

Well, in one of the second season eppisodes, Antonie is captured by a 
canibal tribe, and the freedom fighters seem to have a negitive reaction.

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  At this point, there is
no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're
pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer
the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution
of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails had not
been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine **D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  **As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified **as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differs in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
features Geoffrey St. John, while another does not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  The
fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS Sega
reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series (as
reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to indicate
that someone had come down with a case of "creative differences."
In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began shipping the
week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden

things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message

Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.

The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  **We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  **Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  **Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  **Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
COMING SOON

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

Well, I don't exactly mind the differences. Besides, after your biting 
letter got printed in Sonic-Grams, Alessandro, I don't know if they'd 
print another.

I shouldn't say anything about this but, why does it have to be that if mobius
is earth in the future that in happens 2000 years from now? Maybe some time in
the future, we humans do something and destory ourselfs. Whats to say that in a
few million years after we die out that animals don't learn to speak and evolve
just like we did? I still beleave that mobius is on another planet somewhere
and who know, maybe they are watching us. But the fact remains that we are
think and weighting everything based on ourselfs and thats not right. Humans
have always done this. We think dinosaurs where dumb but dumb compaird to what,
us? In that case yes, every other living thing on earth is dumb. But what do I
know. Anyway, lets get back on track.

AUTHOR'S NOTE:  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Morgan for

appreciated. 


	The cold chill of Winter was slowly passing and being replaced by
the damp warmth of Spring.  All throughout the Great Forest, signs of the
season could be seen everywhere.  In the heart of the forest, at Knothole
Village, the freedom fighters welcomed t he Spring after a harsh, cold
winter.  Now that the winter was over, activity would increase.  One of
the activities being engaged in on this particular day, was the testing of
one of Rotor's new inventions.
	A line of targets had been set up and were waiting.  Without
warning, a metallic fist shot through one of them with amazing force. 
Twenty-five yards away, Rotor watched and took notes as Bunnie used her
extendable left arm to destroy each target in turn.
	"How's it feel?" asked Rotor as Bunnie pulled her robotic arm back
to its normal length.
	"Smooth as glass, sugar," said Bunnie, smiling.
	"Great," replied Rotor "There's just one more thing.  May I?"
	Rotor gestured to Bunnie's arm which she lifted to him.  Rotor
opened a side panel and did some more tinkering.  As he worked, Bunnie
felt something click inside her arm.
	"Oh, what was that?" she asked.	
	"Just a locking system," replied Rotor "We wouldn't want you
driving that fist into anything by accident would we."
	"No we wouldn't," Bunnie agreed.
	"Now that we finally perfected this, you'll be able to bulls-eye
Swat-bots right between the eyes at twenty-five yards," said Rotor.
	Bunnie grinned.
	"I'd rather bulls-eye Robotnik, but I get your point," Bunnie responded.
	"I know what you mean," Rotor said, chuckling briefly.
	There was a moment of silence between the two.  Rotor hated
moments like this when words escaped him.  He looked into Bunnie's eyes as
he fought for his voice.  There was something welling up in his heart that
he wanted to say, but he couldn't bring himself to say it.  He shook the
thought from his mind as he found his voice.
	"Well, I guess that just about does it," he said hastily, gathering
up his notes "If you have any problems with it let me know."
	Bunnie looked at him consideringly for a moment.
	"Alright, sugar," she replied "you can count on it."

	As she walked back to her hut, Bunnie thought about what had
happened.  She had seen the look of uncertainty on Rotor's face.  She saw
the nervousness in his eyes.  She often wondered what it was that made
Rotor seem so uncertain of himself.  Even more t han that, she wondered
why her heart was always racing during those times when Rotor struggled
for words.  It was as if, during moments like that, she would kill just to
find out what he really wanted to say.
	Later that night, after Bunnie crawled into bed, she lay awake for
several minutes thinking about Rotor.  She thought of how good he was at
the things he does, and about how he seemed to want to devote so much time
to her.  As she fell asleep that night, Rotor was the last thought on her mind.

  	Bunnie fell out of bed and lay stunned for a minute, not quite awake
yet.  When she did come fully conscious, she found to her dismay that her
right leg was paralyzed. 
    	"Oh my stars," Bunnie gasped, her heart skipping a beat.  "Oh no! 
What will I do?" 
    	Not letting herself get worked up into hysterics, she steeled herself
and grasped the footboard of the bed.  Her robotic arm was more that
strong enough to pull her body upright. 
     	"There, Bunniegirl!" she said to herself, "No reason to worry none. 
All you got to do now is to get yourself over to Rotor's.  I hope the
sugar-rus won't mind me knocking at this time of the night..." 

     	It was three in the morning when Rotor sat back from the story he'd
been writing.  He rubbed his eyes and yawned, then saved his file and shut
down his computer. 
	"Got yourself sucked in again," he chuckled to himself as he walked
over to the sink for a glass of water. 
     	He turned at the knock at the door.  Taking the water with him, he
went to answer it. 
     	"Bunnie!" he said, glad to see her.  Then he noticed something was
wrong. 
     	"I'm so sorry to wake you, darlin'," Bunnie said, shifting her
weight.  "But I need your help." 
     	"Sure," Rotor said, motioning her to enter.  "What's wrong?"
     	"My right leg's frozen, sugar," Bunnie said, her courage beginning
to crack. 
     	"Oh," Rotor gasped, setting down the glass aside on the dresser
beside the door. 
	"Come on," he added, helping Bunnie inside.  "I'll take care of you."
     	Rotor lifted Bunnie up and sat her on his worktable, which was high
enough to let him work on the leg comfortably.  He brought over his
scanner and his tool box and set up to work. 
     	"I'm awfully grateful to you, sugar," Bunnie said, trying to be
chipper.  But it was clear she was frightened. 
     	"Don't worry, Bunnie," Rotor said, pausing to look into her eyes and
place an assuring hand on her furry shoulder.  "You're gonna be fine." 
     	Bunnie smiled, happy the walrus was so understanding.  She sat
patiently as he worked, admiring his confidence and seeing that he
actually enjoyed his work.  Soon he was finished. 
     	"Don't try to move it yet," he said, putting away his tools.  
	"Give it a few minutes to warm up."
     	"What happened?" Bunnie asked.
      	"Old cable snapped lose, is all," Rotor explained.  "Did you fall,
or eh, pull a muscle?" he added with a chuckle. 
      	"I did fall out of bed!" Bunnie giggled, feeling so relived and happy.
      	Rotor sighed.  He loved to hear Bunnie laugh.  He loved to hear her
talk, period.  He moved to speak to her, but words failed him now, and a
fear of sounding foolish or forward cooled his amorous drive altogether. 
      	Bunnie could see the change in Rotor's face she knew so well. 
Placing her hand to her heart, she recalled how often Rotor would seem so
happy and peaceful, but suddenly go dark and silent.  Oh, how it bothered
her! 
      	"What's wrong, darlin'?! she asked, putting her hand on Rotor's
shoulder. "Why so sad all of a sudden?" 
      	"Oh, I dunno," Rotor sighed, leaning against the table.  He put his
hand on Bunnie's hard metallic thigh, appearing to examine it, but his
then touch softened and he slipped his hand up to Bunnie's yielding waist. 
He swallowed as the warmth of the rabbit's body passed into his palm. 
      	"What is it, sugar?" Bunnie asked again, her heart quickening at his
touch. 
      	Rotor took a deep breath and looked straight into Bunnie's eyes.
      	"It's just that I..." he began again, then hesitated.  Shaking his
head he grunted with frustration. 
      	"Yes, darlin'?" Bunnie coaxed him, her eyes soft and receptive.
      	"I like you a whole lot," Rotor finally said.  "And I think I love you."
      	"Oh, Rotor," Bunnie sighed.  A tear fell from her eye.
      	Rotor shivered and stepped back.
      	"Oh, I'm sorry," he gasped, becoming agitated.  "I'm so sorry.  I
shocked you.  I shouldn't have said it.  I'm sorry." 
      	"No," Bunnie gasped, trying to slip off the table.  "No," darlin'! 
You're all right!" 
      	"Don't move!" Rotor warned, pushing his body against hers to prevent
the rabbit from hitting the floor and undoing the surgery. 
      	"Oh, Rotor," Bunnie said, bringing him closer into an embrace.  
	"You sweet thing!"  She choked, trying not to cry. Yet knowing now
how Rotor felt about her was overwhelming. 
     	"Bunnie," Rotor gasped, afraid of what was happening to them.  It
was wrong to start it this way, he scolded himself.  She's too
vulnerable...  She can't think...  I can't think! 
     	He stood helpless for a few moments, holding Bunnie as she cried
against his chest. 
     	"You needn't be afraid," Bunnie sobbed.  "You darlin'...!"
     	"I'm afraid I've upset you," Rotor said, rocking the rabbit gently.
"I shouldn't have told you this way.  You're tired and scared...  It just
isn't right..." 
     	"I'm not afraid anymore!" Bunnie said, now incredibly happy.  "Not
when I'm here with you." 
     	Rotor drew back from the embrace and bent to examine Bunnie's leg.
	"Try to move it now."
     	Bunnie found that her leg moved easily.  Rotor lifted her up and
placed her gently to the floor upon her feet.  Bunnie walked around the
room a few times.  Satisfied that her leg was good as new, she approached
Rotor and moved to hold him again. 
     	But Rotor held Bunnie back.
     	"I think you'd better go," he said.
     	"Okay," Bunnie said, confused but cooperative.  "If you want me to."
     	Rotor walked her to the door but did not open it.  He stood for a
moment, searching his mind for something else to say that would explain
his behavior, but found nothing.  He felt terrible. 
     	This was not the way he wanted it to happen.
     	At his pause Bunnie took the opportunity to embrace Rotor again and
give him a loving kiss on the mouth, not too passionate, but strong enough
to let the walrus understand that everything was all right and that the
love between them was mutual. 
     	"Thanks Rotor," Bunnie said.  "Good night."
     	"Good night," Rotor said, opening the door.
     	Bunnie paused on the porch and looked back at Rotor.
     	"Let me know how that leg is, Bunnie," Rotor said.
     	"Of course, sugar," Bunnie said softly.
     	Rotor nodded goodbye and closed the door.
     	Bunnie watched the lights go out in Rotor's hut.  Letting out a
heavy sigh, she went back to her hut, knowing she would not sleep that
night for thinking of her friend. 
     	Inside the hut, Rotor climbed into bed and tried to go to sleep.  He
rolled over and pulled the covers over his head. 
     	"You did it all wrong," he scolded himself.  "ALL wrong!"

	In the morning, Rotor sat miserably at his table as he munched on
a sweet roll.  He didn't think it was possible for him to feel any worse. 
Last night had been a total disaster as far as he was concerned.  He had
been waiting for the perfect moment to t ell Bunnie how he felt, and last
night wasn't it.
	However, the truth was out now.  Bunnie knew exactly how Rotor
felt about her.  He wondered briefly if he'd ever be able to look at
Bunnie again without feeling guilty about how he had taken advantage of
her vulnerability the night before.  How would he deal with all that had
happened?  It was clear that he needed advice, but who to go to?  Antoine
considered himself to be creation's gift to females, and Bookshire, for
all his life experience, had never been in love, at least not to anyone's
knowledge.  Sonic was the only one left.  He was in a deep relationship
with Sally, so he seemed to be the perfect person to go to.  After he
finished breakfast, Rotor went out to find him, hoping he wouldn't run
into Bunnie along the way. 

	Bunnie rolled over in bed.  As predicted, she had not slept a wink
since 3:00 am.  Since the moment she got back from seeing Rotor, he was
all she could think of.  The idea that he loved her was not entirely new
to her.  There had been several times in t he past when she suspected that
that's what it was, but she had never explored the possibility.  Now it
was all out in the open.  Rotor loved her.  That's why he wanted to spend
time with her and be close to her.  It was also why he would suddenly
become silent and distant when words failed.
	The one thing that confused her most was that, after he told her,
he seemed to collapse in on himself and regret that he had said anything. 
When she had wanted to embrace him, he wanted her to leave.
	As she slipped out of her nightgown and got dressed, she thought
of how their relationship had started.  From the very first day she was
robotizized, he had been there for her.  During the times when she was
frustrated because she couldn't get her legs t o work properly or the
times when she would accidently crush something in her robotic hand, he
had been there to pick her up and encourage her to keep trying.  She
remembered how happy she had been the day she was able to shake Rotor's
hand with no fear o f crushing it into a bloody mess.
	When she finished dressing, she went out to find Sally.  She needed 
advice and she needed it now.

	As Rotor walked down by the power ring pool, he heard a sonic boom as 
Sonic raced up.
	"Hiya, Rote," said Sonic "How are ya'"
	"Sonic, am I glad to see you, " said Rotor.
	"What is it?" asked Sonic, somewhat more seriously.
	"I need advice," replied Rotor "I've got a major problem."
	"Tell me about it," said Sonic.
	"Well, it's about Bunnie . . .I'm in love with her, Sonic," he said.
	"Alright!" exclaimed Sonic "Congratulations!"
	When Sonic saw Rotor didn't share his excitement, he calmed down.
	"Last night she came to me because she was having a problem with
her leg, "Rotor said "She was scared.  After I fixed her leg, I told her
how I felt."
	"So?  I don't get what your problem is," said Sonic.
	"It was the wrong time!" exclaimed Rotor "She was tired and scared
and I took advantage of her and her feelings.  Now, I've gone and ruined
the whole thing."
	"Well, what makes you think it was the wrong time?" asked Sonic
"How did she react when you told her?"
	"Well . . .she seemed shocked at first, then she started crying. 
Whether it was from shock or happiness, I'm not sure," replied Rotor.
	"Look Rote, if she didn't flatly refuse you, I'd say that was a
pretty good sign she was happy," said Sonic.
	"Well, she did kiss me before she left," admitted Rotor.
	"There you go," said Sonic smiling "That just proves my point.  It
may not have been the situation you were planning on telling her in, but
she doesn't seem to care.  The point is she's glad you told her at all."
	"So, what do I do now?" asked Rotor.
	"Well," Sonic thought for a moment "Do something romantic for her."
	"Like what?" asked Rotor.
	"Well, sometimes Sally and I arrange late-night encounters in the
garden.  We talk and look at the stars.  We sometimes end up in some of
the most passionate kissing sessions you ever heard of," said Sonic,
chuckling briefly "Obviously, you and Bunnie just started in your
relationship so you wouldn't be that deep yet, but I think you see where
I'm going with this."
	"Yeah, I think so," said Rotor "Thanks for the advice."
	"No prob," said Sonic cheerfully "That's one of the many reasons
I'm here.  Good luck!"
	Sonic powered up and raced off into the distance.

	"He's so uncertain at times, it's almost nerve-racking," Bunnie was
saying "Now that he's told me how he feels, he seems even worse."
	Bunnie and Sally sat in Sally's hut talking about the events of
the previous night.
	"Well, Rotor's a shy person," said Sally "You just need to give him
some time to come to terms with his feelings."
	"The problem is I don't think he intended to tell me under
conditions like those," said Bunnie.
	"Admissions of love are rarely planned out," said Sally "He's
probably just in shock by the fact that he told you during a time that he
thought was inappropriate."
	"So, how do I help him come around?" asked Bunnie.
	"That's very hard to do.  Usually its better to wait a while to see
if he come out of it by himself," Sally said "Julayla used to say 'Time
heals all wounds'.  Just be patient.  You love him and you know he loves
you, all it needs is time." 

	A few days later, Rotor paced back and forth in his hut trying to
decide how to get Bunnie to meet him that night.  He had decided to set up
a romantic encounter in the garden, but setting it up was harder than he
thought.  With Sonic's help he had managed to gather the appropriate
materials, now all he had to do was ask Bunnie to meet him.  He wasn't
quite ready to go up and ask her directly, he wanted to do it another way. 
Suddenly, he snapped his fingers as he got an idea. 

	Over in Bunnie's hut, Bunnie sat by the window thinking about the
things she and Sally had talked about.  Suddenly, she heard a noise over
by here front door.  Going over to investigate, she found a small piece of
paper on the floor that someone must hav e slipped under her door. 
Unfolding it, she noted the wonderful handwriting style as she read it: 



	My dearest love:
	My feelings for you run deep and I can't be without you.  I would
	like to ask you to meet me in the garden tonight around Nine o'clock so
	that we may discuss the feelings we have for one another. 

								Love,
 								Rotor


	Bunnie almost cried out in joy as she finished reading.  He heart
sang as she went over to her wardrobe and decided what to wear.  Tonight
would not be a night she would soon forget. 

	That night as the clock move slowly toward nine, Rotor waited
nervously.  Next to him on a table he had set up was a CD player with a
disc of slow, romantic music in it.
	As he turned toward the garden entrance, the site that met his
eyes took his breath away.  Bunnie was standing at the entrance smiling at
him.  Instead of the normal purple garb she usually wore, she was decked
out in a stunning purple dress that was of such beauty that it must have
been something she had been saving for a special occasion.
	"Good evening, Rotor" she said softly as she walked up to him.
	Rotor's voice caught in his throat for a moment before he found it
again.
	"Good evening," he said "You look real nice, Bunnie."
	"Thanks," said Bunnie, smiling.
	Rotor hesitated another moment as he looked deep into her eyes. 
They were so beautiful, Rotor thought, she was so beautiful.  The feeling
of love were welling up inside him like never before.
	"Bunnie," he began "about the other night . . ."
	"Shhh," Bunnie said soothingly "I understand, sugar.  You were
nervous and afraid.  It's okay."
	"It's just that I love you so much, I didn't want to hurt you,"
said Rotor.
	"You didn't hurt me," said Bunnie "You told me what was in your
heart.  You let your feelings out into the open.  To be honest, I'm glad
you did.  I love you too, Rotor"
	Rotor couldn't think of a response to that, but he didn't need to. 
Bunnie leaned forward and they embraced in a kiss more passionate than the
one of a few days ago.  They stayed like that for what seemed to be an 
eternity before pulling back.
	"Mmm, that was nice," said Bunnie "You ever kiss a girl before?"
	"No," admitted Rotor.
	"Well, in that case, I'm impressed," Bunnie said, the smile never
leaving her face.
	As they released, Bunnie glanced over and saw the CD player.
	"What's that for?" she asked.
	"I thought that maybe we could . . . well, you know, perhaps we
could . . .dance?" he said.
	"I'd love to," replied Bunnie.
	Rotor walked over and turned on the music.  It was slow and
beautiful.  Returning to Bunnie, he took her in his arms and they began to
dance slowly around the garden.  Never for a moment did they take their
eyes off each other.  They simply gazed lovingly at each other as if in a
trance while their legs moved them about in perfect rhythm. 

	Sonic and Sally were walking down the path by the garden when they
heard the soft music.  Pausing by the garden entrance, they observed the
two lovers dancing in the moonlight.  Sonic smiled.
	"Looks like my advice paid off," he whispered to Sally.
	"How do you know it wasn't my advice that helped," Sally asked.
	"The hedgehog knows," he whispered boastfully.
	"Oh really," said Sally "Well, why don't we leave these two alone
and discuss the matter in private."
	"Sounds good to me.  Lead the way," replied Sonic.
	Sonic and Sally quietly slipped away as Rotor and Bunnie continued to 
dance.  As they did, they both realized in their hearts that they would be 
together forever.  They would never leave each other side and they would love 
each other always.  The feeling between them were now too strong to break.  
They knew they would remember this day for the rest of their lives.

	A wise person once said:
		A day needs not a name to be made special,
		Nor does it need a victorious battle,
		Nor a brutal slaughter,
		All it needs is the true love of two people.

	For Bunnie and Rotor, as they danced the night way under the stars, 
there was nothing truer than that.

THE END

Last night a posted a picture of Tails playing a guitar that I scanned here 
at work.  It is approximately 225x250, scanned at 24-bit.  I think it's a 
pretty cool pict!  :)

I also uploaded it to the following FTP site:

ftp://ftp.mv.com/pub

I assume it'll end up in the Sonic directory.

Enjoy!

Hi guys!

Does everyone out there have software capable of decoding Mime encoded
files?  My PC Eudora is going nuts, and I can't just cut and past data from a
text file as easily as I used to.  Please respond ASAP.

Well, I have Pine v3.91 and that reads them alright.  I can't speak for 
anyone else but I have no problems with Mime.

Greetings to all fellow Sonic Hedgehog fans!

"The Temporal Syndrome":  Part 2 is now available for your reading and
downloading enjoyment.  I'm working on Part 3 (the final entry), and hopefully
that won't take so long to hammer out.

I had to split this part of the story in two [(1/2) and (2/2)], since 
Windows 3.11
apparently can't handle cutting and pasting data beyond a certain size as far
as text files are concerned.  Since I didn't get a very favorable responce rate
from my post (the question of whether people had Mime decoding capability
or not), this seemed like the only other logical choice.

CU for Part 3,

Trials of time...

	Five-hundred million years later, the automatic probe remained
as the only surviving evidence that the Cassandrans ever
existed.  Ironically, the very act of the probe (however
accidental) saving itself from doom destroyed an entire race. 
If the probe had even a vestige of emotion for what its act had
done, it might consider itself lucky.  In a span of time that
organic lifeforms have great difficulty in comprehending, the
probe had left its home system and arrived at another place, far
from the planet of lifeforms that wished to destroy it and its
lethal cargo.  The probe had, in its own way, accomplished a
great deal, even if only for the sake of survival.
	However, survival didn't come without a cost.  Over time, major
systems that insured the proper operation and integrity of the
probe were disabled by decay or damage from the primal span of
space.  After about two years in warp space, the probe's
navigational shield generator lost the power connection to the
shield array.  What started at that point (and continued through
the operational lifespan of the probe) was an incessant barrage
orchestrated on the probe by the universe.  The once pristine
metaliceramic case became pitted by the bombardment of hydrogen
ions, dust, and other interstellar material.  The probe's
computer decreased the probe's velocity to sublight (.05 c), but
the pelting continued.
	The probe suffered other attacks besides dust.  About 250
million years into its journey to nowhere in particular, the
probe came a little too close to a supernova.  The shockwave
didn't rupture the hull, but it did commit severe damage to the
aft sensor array.  The probe engaged warp drive to escape from
the anticipated carnage that would ensue, but not without
becoming partially blind first.  Unknown to the probe, engaging
warp drive at this point would cause more damage than the
supernova itself would.  For the probe was still in the
proximity of the leading energy wave, and a warp engagement here
under any circumstances was hazardous.  The lead energy wave
intensified over the warp nacelles, to the point of rupturing
the field control inductors.  Plasma from the damaged nacelles
funneled back toward the matter/antimatter reactant core, then
back to the nacelles.  Energy cycled back and forth through the
plasma/energy transfer system.  The result:  an short-lived
isostatic energy state.  The probe shot away from the exploding
star with a newfound speed, staying in warp space for about two
days.  Resulting damage:  loss of maneuvering thrusters,
moderate damage to the computer core, and warp power conduit
coolant loss to space.
	After the probe's computers managed to regain control of the
probe, the warp core and all associated hardware were jettisoned
to prevent any unexpected warp engagement, leaving the probe
with an ion drive as its sole means of propulsion and power. 
The probe was safe, but not for very long.
	Five million years ago, the probe lost its forward sensor array
and the ion drive.  It drifted through space, blind and
powerless.  The probe became the playtoy of gravitational forces
that eventually aimed it toward an unassuming star system in an
unknown region of space.  The probe entered the system, being
tossed about repeatedly by the planets.  The probe apparently
thought that it should take out its frustrations on the unseen
offenders.  On the next gravitational pull, the probe twisted so
that it would be parallel to the enemy.  The probe fell straight
into the gravitational field, but this would be the last one to
torment it.

Present day, 0600 hours at Robotropolis...

	Robotnik was on his command chair, facing away from the main
video/data display system in the Command & Control Center.  He
scanned over the data displayed on a data screen on an armrest
of his chair.  It was data of a sort he wasn't particularly fond
of.  Apparently Sonic had managed to narrowly escape yet again
from a well-laid trap, and Robotnik found out why.  SWATBot
reinforcements were not of sufficient amount in Sector 21B,
probably due to a misallocation in the SWATBot distribution. 
What angered Robotnik even more was the fact that Sector 21B was
(emphasis on was) the area where the Advanced Technology R&D
Laboratory had been.  The facility had been the mainstay of
Robotnik's war against the Mobius Freedom Fighters, churning out
more powerful laser emitters and generators, more efficient
engines for the Hover Units, new chemicals, and other methods of
dealing with the troublesome upstarts.  Now that facility was no
more, and Robotnik felt a little more vulnerable to whatever
cruel desires that the Freedom Fighters had.  Feeling vulnerable
wasn't an appropriate mindset for the Conqueror of Mobius.
	He drove that point home by thrusting his roboticised arm down
on the data display, hard.  Unfortunately, the device wasn't
constructed to withstand such treatment.  The screen shattered,
expelling electronic circuitry all over the floor.  Amazed for
an instant, the irony of the situation revealed itself to
Robotnik.  He didn't need Sonic and his subordinates to destroy
what technology he and Snively were able to create and utilize. 
He could destroy it all himself, and do a much better job of it
as well.  What was merely an embarrassing emotional outburst,
even if only to himself, only made the situation worse.  There
was one less useful video display in the room, testimony to the
futility of both the situation and the animalistic response.  He
sat in his command chair with a scowl that even he didn't know
he make until now.
	Robotnik wasn't the only person present to hear the cacophony
of hardware stressed beyond its designed physical limits. 
Snively was monitoring the power outputs from the main
hydroelectric plants when Robotnik temporarily lost his normally
calm, dark composure.  Snively stiffened with primal fear, as if
there would be another blow struck in the near future, meant for
him.  Slowly regaining his courage, Snively redirected his eyes
from the main command computer to his natural eye level, and
slowly rotated his body around to a point where he could see the
back of Robotnik's command chair.  Sweeping his eyes over the
floor around the chair, he noticed the end product of Robotnik's
brief display of emotional chaos.  Another small vidscreen
recycled, and for the fifth time this week.  If the Hedgehog
retained his record of successful attacks on them, pretty soon
Robotnik would start ripping Robotropolis apart in anger,
transistor by transistor, and wire by wire.  Snively didn't know
whether to speak at this point or not, and then decided it
wouldn't make a difference anyway.
	Robotnik amazed himself for the third time that day when his
scowl became even sharper by the sound of Snively's voice.
	"Sir?"  Snively ventured forth onto unknown territory, but his
curiosity had gotten the better of him.
	What happened next was totally unexpected.  Robotnik pressed a
key on the left chair command panel to rotate the chair around
to face Snively.  He slowly rose out of the chair, paced over to
Snively's position, and grabbed him by the collar.  Robotnik
gave Snively a very hard, irritated stare about six inches from
his face.
	"Yes, Mr. Snively?"  Robotnik gave him a rather dangerous
invitation.
	Snively could only reply with a nervous laugh and started
fingering his shirt collar.  Robotnik responded by darkening his
stare even further, and said with the model of an impatient
ruler, "Well, Snively?"  He nearly shrieked on that statement.
	Any courage that Snively ever had vanished at that point.  He
could only give Robotnik a stare, the pathetic stare similar to
a person that was about to be roboticised.  Robotnik gave
Snively a cringe of dismissal, drew the arm that he was holding
Snively with back, and threw him at the wall.  The resounding
impact of flesh on metal, plus seeing Snively knocked out cold,
calmed Robotnik down a degree.  A very small degree.  It seemed
that nothing would be accomplished today at this rate.  The loss
of the R&D facility, plus the success of Sonic for bypassing
security via a gap that never should have existed around a very
sensitive military area, were not encouraging.
	The situation was about to change.  Robotnik heard the sound of
three robots walking in cadence, two metallic, one not.  The
three robots walked into the C&C with what sounded almost like a
determined candor.  The two SWATBots stopped, and moved into
their guard positions by the doorway.  The other robot, actually
an android, continued to step forward.  The android then scanned
over the room with all the sensors available to it, looking over
the decimated vidscreen and Snively lying on the floor in a
rather uncomfortable position.  Taking stock of the situation,
it decided to keep a respectable distance from Robotnik.  You
never know when you might be the next advanced artificial
construct to visit Dr. Robotnik, but never go out again in
functional condition.
	Seeing his pride and joy, Cmdr. Packbell, Robotnik's anger
simmered down to nothing nearly immediately.  "Yes, Packbell,"
said Robotnik in a voice that would redeem a criminal, "what
news do you have to report?"
	"Sir," said Packbell in a calm monotone, to prevent the former
anger from erupting on him, "I have news of a spacecraft that
fell from space at about 0400 hours.  I was on patrol with the
Delta SWAT Team looking for the Wolf Pack Freedom Fighters
during that time."
	"Are you certain that it was from space, and not just one of
our spy satellites?" Robotnik questioned.
	"Yes, sir.  The mass, volume, and general configuration do not
match any of our surveillance or other equipment.  It also does
not match anything that we know that Knothole or any other
Freedom Fighter group has.  It is more than likely from another
planet."  Packbell tried to parse the information out as
completely as possible, still not completely convinced that
Robotnik was in a benign mood.
	Robotnik's interest was piqued.  "Where is this spacecraft now?"
	"About 200.7 kilometers south of here, located in Granite
Wastes of the Great Unknown, sir.  We have also found something
in it that you might find particularly interesting."
	"Is that so?  Show me the reconnaissance tapes."  Robotnik was
very interested now.
	Packbell strolled over to the main computer, and pressed the
appropriate controls to call up the requested video data.  A
second later, a still-graphic appeared with the piece of
equipment that Packbell anticipated might be of importance to
Robotnik.  Robotnik's eyes went wide when he looked over the
device.  From the looks of it, it could very well turn the tide
of the war toward Robotnik's favor.
	If there was any doubt in Packbell's mind that Robotnik's day
was about to be a good one, all of it disappeared.  "Very well,"
Robotnik said, all interest still focused on the image, "inform
the surveillance team that I want that weapon back here
immediately, as well as any information they can find about its
operation."
	A slight pause from Packbell.  Nearly insignificant, but enough
to speak of trouble.
	"Well, Packbell?  Are there any problems with those orders?" 
Robotnik's anger slowly reemerged, taking a new target in its
sights.
	It was Packbell's turn to begin worrying about his future
welfare.  One look at Snively reconfirmed just how far Robotnik
would tolerate such insubordination.  Packbell searched through
his positronic matrix to find any flaws that might have caused
him to withhold the information, possibly a connection that may
have decayed over time due to lack of use.  A small feeling of
horror built up in Packbell, after completing a full diagnostic,
and finding nothing.  One of the many other things to attribute
to his reaction by what limited emotional level he had;  not by
an electronic failure.
	He managed to regain his composure in time to save his
circuitry from the robot recycler.  "Yes, sir.  There is a
matter of difficulty involved in executing those commands.  In
order to return the weapon and the required operational data to
Robotropolis, there is a matter of being able to do the
requested operations in the first place."
	"How is that so?"  Robotnik's dark stare and gravely voice
slowly intensified, a sign that Packbell had not yet been
reprieved from uncertain physical damage.
	"The craft has many occurrences of hieroglyphics, for lack of a
better term, on the computers and the weapon's protective
housing.  I projected that they would have the required
information as to how the weapon's housing would be opened, and
the same may be true for the data download procedure."  A pause,
as if to consider what else needed to be said, and then he
continued.  "I instructed the SWATBots to attempt a brute-force
method of obtaining both;  however, the results were not
successful.  In short, a language translator is required to aid
in opening the protective housing and downloading the data."
	Robotnik calmed down, but not completely.  A hint of a
dangerous red glow from Robotnik's eyes still glared in
Packbell's face.  "Do you mean to tell me that you don't have
the facilities to get a translation?"
	"No, Dr. Robotnik.  I have no such program available to me, and
I could not download it from any data site from our position. 
That is why I returned without the weapon and the data.  I
required something or someone that could alleviate the problem
of translation."  Packbell managed to retain his composure, even
though he knew that he was standing near what could very well
turn into a mental version of an unstable nuclear reactor slowly
building toward meltdown condition.
	Surprisingly, Robotnik disengaged his stare, thought over the
change in the situation, and started his scheming mode.  He
paced the floor for a few minutes, Packbell remained in his
position by the main computer.  "Very well, then," Robotnik
finally said.  "Inform the service crews that I want my personal
Hover Unit ready in the next five minutes.  You and I will join
the reconnaissance group."
	As if suddenly remembering something, Packbell stuttered, "What
about......"  He pointed in Snively's general direction. 
Snively, for the moment, was still on vacation.
	"Never mind him.  He can catch up with us after he wakes up. 
Now, Packbell my boy, let's see about that weapon."
	Five minutes later, Robotnik and Packbell were cruising toward
the eastern outpost for the linguistics program archive, certain
that Snively would not take part in the mission anytime soon. 
However, there was someone unnoticed in the air ducts that saw
and missed nothing.  Charles Hedgehog ran back down the air
ducts, toward the location of his covert operations base.

0620 hours, in the Great Plains...

	The sun was just barely above the horizon, its light creating
an array of complex and beautiful patterns of colors across the
sky.  To any observer, it would be so distracting that they
would forget that Mobius ever was at war with Robotnik, and that
their day to be alive as an organic lifeform would be their
last.  Compared to the overly-familiar background of the somber
and depressing pollution cloud that wrapped over Robotropolis
like a Terran boa constrictor, this scene was heaven.  The air
was pure with the smell of clean air;  not the choking, lethal
atmosphere that Robotnik called his home.  Yes, a spectator
would almost forget everything that took place in the past
eleven years.  Almost.
	From this particular vantage point, located somewhere in the
Great Plains, the observer could see Robotropolis' microcosm, a
reminder of reality.  The atmosphere had a reality of its own: 
a benign and malignant side.  There were areas where they alone
were present and the dominant form, and others where they
intermixed, as if even Mobius' biosphere was fighting a war of
it's own to keep the evil clouds at bay.  It wasn't entirely
clear as to what side had the advantage and would eventually
become victorious, so it seemed to be a stalemate.  So far.
	The significance of the atmospheric battle that had been going
on for about eleven years had not been lost on Princess Sally. 
She had trouble sleeping the past night, due to the work
involved with being the first defense front against Robotnik. 
So she decided to suspend the war, at least in her mind, for a
little while so she could relax.  Belatedly realizing the error
in choosing this location to view the sunrise only made her mood
worse.  For that battle between the two areas of Mobius'
biosphere had a symbolic connection to what the current
situation with the war against Robotnik was.  There was no win
or lose;  there was only an isostatic balance between the
offensive acts of the armies.
	'We give what seems to be the final blow to Robotnik's plans,
and he's able to turn around and do the same to us!' Sally
screamed with near-despair in her mind.  'No matter what we do,
both sides end up equal.  Only while Robotnik loses SWATBots, we
lose good-hearted people!'  Sally considered the situation,
almost thought it futile.  'No!  I-we can't let that come
between us and the safety of Mobius, as well as our families. 
We will stop Robotnik some day in the future!'
	At this point, Sally started crying.  The tears and the intent,
however, were of brazen determination;  not sadness.  Amazing
how the war had progressed on for so long, and yet people still
had the tenacity to face it with the same drive they had so many
years ago.  One point in the Freedom Fighters' favor.
	She looked up at the sky again, and saw an imaginary blue
speck.  She rubbed her eyes to remove it from her field of
vision.  The speck remained visible, and it was moving at a high
velocity toward the east.  Fearing the worst, Sally reached into
her backpack and pulled out an IR/binocular unit.  She saw that
her suspicions were correct.  It was difficult to know what
operation was underway, but it's generally a sign of trouble for
the Freedom Fighters when Robotnik is personally going to an
area to inspect the process of his schemes.  She turned to run
back to Knothole.

	When she was near the Great Plains/Great Forest border, she
heard the trilling hoot of the messenger bird.  It was high
above, and apparently did not see her.  Sally cupped a fist
around her mouth and called to the bird.  He responded by
swooping down, and executing an expertly-placed landing on
Sally's outstretched arm.  She the top off the cylindrical
container and pulled out a paper with a message inscribed on it.
 It read:

NEW SITUATION DEVELOPING:

ROBOTNIK HAS THE LOCATION OF AN ALIEN PROBE THAT HAS
CRASH-LANDED IN THE GREAT UNKNOWN.  CONTAINS WEAPON OF UNKNOWN
TYPE.  SEND A TEAM TO THESE COORDINATES TO INVESTIGATE:

20N 30W

	Included with the message was a small data disk.  She took a
quick look over the video data, and considered the potential of
what this craft had to offer.  Needless to say, it did not bode
well.  Sally quickened her pace to twice as fast as before,
given the severity of the events that might unfold if actions
were not taken to prevent whatever Robotnik had in mind.

* * *

	Immediately after returning to Knothole, Sally assembled a
small investigatory team for the mission at her hut.  It
consisted of:  Sonic as field commander, Dulcy as transporter,
and herself as computer expert.  Sally had called Bookshire in
to assist with making modifications to Nicole, in the hopes that
Nicole would be able to translate the alien language seen on
many of the craft's computers and other hardware.  This turned
into an extensive technical conversation that Sonic was not
privy to the finer details of.  This went on for about 20
minutes, and then he couldn't withstand the technical jargon
that seemed to permeate the hut.  He made his level of technical
knowledge abundantly clear to the rest of the investigatory
party.
	"Now wait a Sonic Second!" the hedgehog interrupted, a
testimony to frustration.  "If you do what, you'll be able to do
who?!  What on Mobius is that?!"  He threw his arms up in a
gesture of surrender.
	Sally was about to give Sonic a message of her own on no
uncertain terms in frustration herself, but Bookshire saved them
both from engaging in a battle of wits which there would be no
definable successor.  Speaking very patiently to Sonic, while
giving Sally a look that convinced her to refrain from dictating
any ascorbic comments, he said, "What we're trying to do is
this, Sonic,"  A pause, and then he continued.  "If we can
interconnect Nicole's language system, that is, the knowledge of
the languages that she already can translate, to the new dynamic
predictive logic circuit that I installed, we might have a
better chance of having Nicole translating the alien's language."
	Sonic gave Bookshire a look that explained that he wasn't
exactly impressed, but he got the message.  "Well, OK," he
finally said.  "But what about all that other stuff that you
were saying about putting in Nicole?"
	Bookshire spoke again as the emotional mediator.  "Those other
circuits are for her sensor array.  There's no telling what
Robotnik found out there, and I had a few new circuits I wanted
to test out."
	Apparently satisfied by the explanations, Sonic walked over to
a chair and sat down with his hands on his forehead, muttering
to himself in a voice so low that noone could comprehend what
was happening in his unique hedgehog mind.  Dulcy looked on the
entire confrontation of techspeak versus the not-so-inclined
hedgehog with a small degree of amusement.  Of course, she had
about as much understanding of the situation as Sonic, but she
was content to wait and try to sort out everything when she
could get a better understanding of technology in general. 
Right now, there was no hope of getting an introductory course
in computer science, so she, like Sonic, had to consign herself
to being lost in the technobabble.  The only distinction was
that Dulcy had considerably more patience, something that made a
difference, even if it was only Sally's nerves that were at
stake.
	The technical conversation resumed, and continued for about
five minutes.  Satisfied with the upgrades to Nicole, Sally
secured Nicole's case together.  "OK team", she said, observing
her comrades, "this is what we need to do."
	What ensued after that point was another technical
conversation, but it was one of tactical nature, something that
Sonic readily understood without question.

* * *

	After all the talk and preparation, the investigation force was
ready to depart for the crash site at about 0900 hours. 
Bookshire stood by Dulcy, explaining to Sally one final time how
to operate the new hardware installed in Nicole.  Sonic, as
usual, looked around with the air of someone lost in a very
boring conversation;  Dulcy just grinned, equally clueless but
not inclined to make the matter a public issue.
	"Now remember, Sally," Bookshire was admonishing, "try to
prevent any excessive motion with Nicole.  It would skew the
alignment on the circuits.  But if anything does happen, press
this key to reset the circuits.  It should reinitialize them and
correct the problem."
	"All right, Bookshire," said Sally.  "Thanks for helping me
with the upgrades."
	"No problem at all, Sally.  Anything to help out a friend in
need of technical assistance.  Ever since Rotor caught that flu,
I've been filling in for him in the past few days."  He paused
to think, and then began speaking in a more severe tone.  "But
you kids have something more important to to than listen me babble off.
Get going to that crash site!"
	Bookshire then paced away as fast as his injured leg would
permit.  The three friends watched him in mutual amazement.
	Suddenly remembering what task they had prepared for, Sally
spoke for the three of them.  "He's right, you know.  Dulcy, you
heard the man.  Let's go!" Sally said decisively.
	"Crack-the-whip time, Sally.  Hang on!" Dulcy warned.
	There was a flutter of wings against air, a feeling of
levitation, and suddenly, a strong propulsive force directed
upward as Dulcy snapped her tail.  A few seconds later, they
were one with the midmorning sky, heading toward uncertain
danger.

(Continued from 1/2)

	It had been about one hour and 45 minutes after Robotnik and
Packbell arrived at the probe's crash site at 0800 hours, and
Robotnik had still been no closer to understanding what the
hieroglyphics meant than what he knew a few hours before. 
Pacing around the dead probe, he kept his eyes on the WorkerBots
and the weapon, with more emphasis on the weapon.  The
hieroglyphics made no sense whatsoever, and it was becoming more
than obvious that the translation program wasn't about to
retrieve the linguistics base anytime soon, if ever.  It was
clear that the device was SOME kind of weapon, but WHAT?  He
considered the point over and over in his mind, knowing that the
time that he spent thinking about the weapon's use gave Sonic
and his companions time to learn that something was amuck, and
they would come to investigate and/or prevent the process from
obtaining completion.  He was about to slip into that mood he
felt earlier in the day, when he learned that the lab had been
destroyed.  Today was about to be another one of those days...
	Apparently Packbell had noticed the general futility of the
situation, for he voiced it for both of them.  "Dr. Robotnik, it
is entirely possible that Sonic may become wise to the
situation.  We must leave soon before he arrives."
	Robotnik cringed in disbelief when he heard that, but he knew
that Packbell was right.  Further waiting on his part would only
serve to jeopardize the mission.  The only option left was to
scrap both the mission and the probe's cargo.  Unless...
	Robotnik considered the unfinished thought further.  'No,
pouring over the language program by ourselves won't be enough,'
he thought.  'However, maybe we can get the Freedom Fighters to
do it for us, and then WE take the weapon!  Yes, that's good,
very good indeed.'
	He then made a turn to Packbell.  "Packbell, notify the
WorkerBots and SWATBots to cancel the retrieval project."
	Packbell could only stand in his position in front of Robotnik,
mouth agape with surprise and possibly mild shock.  "Doctor," he
said, "are you certain about this?"
	Robotnik's anger nearly flared, surprised at Packbell's
ignorance to the opportunity that leaving the probe would give
them.  "Yes, Packbell my boy.  Leave the probe.  This would give
us the opportunity for the Freedom Fighters to do the work for
us."  He managed to keep his anger under control, at least on
the outside.
	Packbell's shocked glare converted to one of elated
understanding as the hexadecimal codes in his positronic matrix
resolved the procedure of this new tactic.  His only response
was to radio the message to the other robots present.  The
robots suddenly stopped working and began converging on their
transport units.  Robotnik and Packbell followed suit.  A few
minutes later, there was no sign of Robotnik or anything else
native to Mobius in the probe's area.  Except for a few stealthy
devices that Robotnik left behind to provide a visual link to
Robotnik's personal Hover Unit.  This precaution was for the
arrival of a certain blue hedgehog that Robotnik knew and
loved...to roboticise.

* * *

	The midday sun blazed in all its fury down on Dulcy, and she
didn't know how much more heat she could withstand.  "How much
further, Sally?" she questioned, unable to hide the evidence of
heat exhaustion from her voice.  "I gotta stop for a water break
soon.  It's hot out here!"
	Sonic and Sally weren't much better off than Dulcy.  Sonic was
sweating so much that he felt like the raging one km-high
waterfall in Bolder Bay.  Sally was feeling a little lightheaded
from the extended thermal exposure.  One point was clear to all
three:  find a shaded area and drink copious amounts of water.
	Sally scanned over the barren landscape for a suitable area
with her IR/binocular unit, then pointed the location out to
Dulcy.  It was a cliff outcrop located in a valley that had
enough shade for the three of them, plus some space to stretch
out and relax for a while.  "Right down there looks fine,
Dulcy," said Sally in a tone similar to Dulcy's.
	"Music to my ears!  Going down!" Dulcy said, ecstatic about the
prospect of being able to get out of the sun's heat for a while.
 With strength that she didn't even know she still had, she
snapped her tail to accelerate down to the new-found haven. 
Acceleration which Sonic and Sally weren't exactly prepared for,
or even able to tolerate.
	"Yo, Dulce!  Not so fast!  I'm gonna hurl if this keeps up!"
Sonic exclaimed, his face becoming a blue-gray tint in response
to the sudden downward thrust.
	It was too late for any deceleration to take place.  Dulcy was
already well into her dive-bomb orientation, about 30 degrees
relative to the ground.  Two seconds later, she angled her upper
body high to facilitate landing, but she did so slightly too
fast.  With her aerodynamics sufficiently disrupted, she and her
friends hung in midair about two meters above the ground.  For a
painfully long time (it was actually about a second), Dulcy
looked over to her companions as if to give an apologetic
"Oops", and then dropped like a massive bomb to the hard rock
below them.  Short screams came from the comrades as the air
forcefully discharged them from its stronghold.
	"Ooohh, I'm home, Ma," Dulcy babbled in mild shock.  After
shaking the disorienting feeling out of her head,  Dulcy took
stock of her situation.  Her posterior was the ultimate tribute
to discomfort, but the pain would pass.  She also felt two furry
bodies gripping her back with unprecedented strength.   Dulcy
looked over her shoulder to Sonic and Sally.  "Are you two OK?"
she inquired, concerned about their facial expressions.
	Sonic looked as if he was ready to expel his breakfast with
extreme prejudice, and Sally wasn't too far behind in completing
a similar act herself.  After having a detailed view of Dulcy's
worried face, they managed to expedite a small degree of control
over their digestive systems.  "Not if you count my stomach,"
the two said in unison, with a hint of the resonance forced by
the impact still in their voices.  Temporarily not in their best
condition, but otherwise functional.  They slid slowly down
Dulcy's back, in order to prevent a relapse of that unpleasant
feeling in their abdominal area.  Dulcy then assisted them in
the short travel to the shade.

	After an hour of lounging in the shaded refuge and having
liberal amounts of water applied both internally and externally,
the three were prepared to continue the mission.  Now all that
remained to be accomplished was to arrive at the intended
destination and prevent Robotnik from taking action on whatever
plan he had for the innovative wartoy.  The only problem was: 
where was the probe relative to their location?
	"Nicole," Sally commanded, "show our location relative to the
location of the alien probe."
	"Unable to comply, Sally," Nicole responded politely, almost
apologetically.  "The present location is an area that has
unusually high concentration of refractory minerals which are
preventing any fix of a reliable bearing."
	Not having the required background in basic geology, Sonic gave
a disdainful look to Sally and Nicole, with emphasis on Nicole. 
He said nothing, for his face revealed all.
	Nicole didn't understand the expression on the hedgehog's face,
but Sally did.  "She means, Sonic," Sally explained, "that there
are rocks in this valley that are affecting her sensors.  We
need to get out of this valley to find the probe's location
again."
	"I don't know about that, Sal," Sonic said thoughtfully. 
"Besides, take a look at that."  To emphasize his point, he
pointed toward the sky.
	Little did they realize during their reprieve from the heat,
the sky had been turning darker and darker during the time that
they spent hiding from the sun.  Darkness meant heavy cloud
cover.  Heavy cloud cover meant rain.  And rain in the desert
meant floods, for the rain came down in a torrential downpour. 
With further consideration, they realized that they were in the
worst possible area to get away from the sun and a flood.  There
was a roar in the distance from the south end of the valley.  A
roar that signified the relentless advance of a solid wall of
water.
	There was no time for words;  only actions would serve their
purpose here.  Sonic and Sally took their positions on Dulcy's
back, and gripped her scales with all the strength they had. 
Dulcy leaped into the air, and shot off like a torpedo with all
the might she could manage to give.  Two seconds later, the wall
of water screamed by them, inundating their resting place that
would have become their permanent residence had they not acted
hastily.
	"Well, so much for getting out of there," Dulcy observed.  "Can
you get a fix on the probe now, Sally?"
	"Sorry, Dulcy," Sally replied.  "Too much interference from the
storm.  I can't even tell what direction we're going."  Nicole's
sensors had been enhanced, but Bookshire and Sally didn't
account for a scenario of this nature where enhanced (but
unshielded) sensors would be at best, only disoriented.  The
worst case wasn't very appealing, and would require the long and
tedious construction of a new computer unit.  This was time that
they didn't have the luxury to spend.  Unless...
	Sally tried to remember everything that Bookshire had installed
in Nicole.  EVERYTHING.  Then, something in her mind finally
connected.
	"Nicole," she said, "decrease the search radius and buffer the
sensor inputs."
	"Sal, what's that going to do?" Sonic said with familiar
confusion.
	"This should help Nicole get a better chance find the probe
again," Sally replied.  "Besides, we can't be too far away from
the probe that we can't just use a short range sensor scan.  It
would take a load off the long-range scanners and be much more
effective."
	Apparently content with the parsed data, Sonic said nothing
further.  The only sounds now were the sounds of the storm,
Dulcy's wings, and Nicole making a scan with the reconfigured
sensors.  A few moments later, an acknowledgment sound came from
Nicole.  The three friends waited in anticipation for the
bearing.
	Sally read the data display, and translated it for Dulcy. 
"Dulcy," she said, "turn right and keep going straight.  That
way is to the probe."
	"All right, Sally," said the dragon.  "Oh, and by the way,"
Dulcy said jokingly, "does anyone want to stay here?  Nice
river-front property available;  wouldn't want to see it go to
waste."
	Helpless guffaws from all three ensued.  Their spirits lifted
again, they flew off to attend to some more serious matters.

* * *

	They came to a stop at an area five km away from the probe's
crash site, dry and none the worse for wear...so far.  Due to
the prearranged mission plans, Dulcy would stay behind and
monitor from a remote location.  Robotnik has been out looking
for dragons again recently, and now wasn't exactly a good time
for a dragon to be visible to his sensors.  He had ways of
capturing dragons that weren't exactly pleasant, plus there was
a chance that Robotnik had that technology with him.  In this
case, stealth was the best defense.
	"Remember, Dulce," Sonic admonished, "you stay here an keep an
eye out for Chrome Dome and his pals.  If we get into trouble,
jam back to Knothole, pronto.  Sal and I will take care of
things at our end."  A pause, and then he continued.  "Any
questions?"
	The dragon could only shake her head in the gesture of "no". 
Dulcy was far too knowledgeable about Freedom Fighter tactics,
and the confrontation with Robotnik was always met with the same
basis of one of the tactical codes:  risk as few people as
possible, while still allowing for successful completion of the
mission.  However, that didn't mean that she was required to
like the orders she had been given.  Dulcy had a concerned look
on her face to that effect.
	Sonic sensed this sign of dissension, and decided to be
diplomatic about it.  "Look, Dulcy," the hedgehog said kindly,
"I know you want to help us kick old Buttnik's tail.  But this
is for your protection as well as ours."  He thought for a few
seconds, tapping his foot, and produced an innovative plan to
appeal to Dulcy.  His eyes lit up with the glee.  "Tell ya
what," he continued, "sometime soon I'm probably going after one
of Robotnik's wartoys in Robotown.  I want you on my lookout
team, only this time, you'll be able to do more."
	Dulcy looked at Sonic in shocked disbelief, but said nothing. 
Sonic nodded with an honest smile on his face to confirm her
suspicions that she hadn't misread his proposal.  She thought it
over, and decided that it was a fair trade.  "Good luck you
two," she finally said.  "I'll be watching to see that you two
kids don't cause any trouble."
	A few seconds of laughter later, and everyone's nerves had been
settled.  Dulcy usually was one to look at the brighter side of
just about everything, and had more than once made that point
apparent, however humorous it was.  Then again, it could have
been because of the humor that people might see in it.  Whatever
the reason, Dulcy got the message, and made it clear in her own
way that she would stolidly stand by her promise.
	Satisfied that his message had completed its intended service,
Sonic said to Sally, "Come on, Sal!  My sneaks are just itching
to hit the old road!"
	"Ready Sonic," was the reply from Sally, analyzing Nicole's
diagnostics.  "Just had check Nicole's sensors.  They're fine."
	"Cool.  So let's get outta here."
	Sonic picked up Sally, and held her horizontally across his
arms.  His feet accelerated in place, and his legs soon became a
circular blur of motion.
	"Warp time!" Sonic exclaimed as his velocity rose to critical.
	There was a sonic boom, and a blue blur where Sonic and Sally
had been.  A few seconds later, they were nearly halfway to the
crashed probe and the mystery weapon it carried.

	On their way to the probe, Sonic thought he saw something very
familiar.  He decelerated to a stop to get a more detailed look
at what this object was.
	"What's wrong, Sonic?" Sally inquired, concerned.
	"I don't get it, Sal," Sonic replied, baffled.  "I think I just
saw US around here somewhere."
	"What are you talking about, Sonic?"
	Sonic had no answer to that question.  He quickly scanned over
the immediate vicinity with his eyes, and found the familiar
objects again.  His suspicions were confirmed.  "Over there,
Sal!  Look!" Sonic blurted, pointing out the location behind the
exposed old granite intrusion.
	Sally looked toward the specified area.  She was just as
shocked by what she saw as Sonic.
	There was another Sonic and Sally present.  The two pairs of
Knothole Freedom Fighters stared at each other for an
indeterminate amount of time, due to the shock of seeing
themselves.
	The "other" Sonic was the one to break the spell.  "Sal, we've
seen ourselves!  We came back too late!" he yelled, the pinnacle
of failure present in his voice.  He picked up the "other" Sally
and sped off to an area unknown.
	Sonic and Sally looked at each other, mouths completely open
with shock again after seeing this totally unexpected spectacle
take place.  Neither knew what to say, until Sonic asked the
obvious question about the authenticity of the "other" Sonic and
Sally.
	Sonic was nearly at a loss for words.  "Sal," he muttered, as
if he didn't trust his mouth to emit coherent speech, "was THAT
us?"
	"It looked like us, but I'm not sure if it was or not," was all
that Sally could contribute to their minuscule library of
knowledge on the subject.
	Sonic considered the matter over again in his mind, thought
about the possibilities, and decided not to progress any further
on the matter.  They had more important ways to occupy their
time, such as finding out what the hieroglyphs in the probe
meant.
	He made the point clear to Sally.  "Well, whether it was or
not," he said with a hint of responsibility in his voice, "we
have more important things to worry about:  Robuttnik and that
probe."
	Sally was still somewhat disoriented, but understood Sonic well
enough to voice her opinion as well.  "I agree.  Let's go!"
	Sonic's legs became a circular blur of motion again, and his
former location exploded in a thunderclap-like sound.  In about
two seconds, he and Sally were at the crash site.
	After their arrival, Sonic performed a quick countersurveilance
procedure, to insure that Robotnik wouldn't be watching them
from a remote location.  Finding no evidence of any equipment,
Sonic gave Sally the "go ahead" gesture.  Sally walked over to a
computer terminal and began work on the hieroglyphics with
Nicole.  Little did they know that Robotnik was watching them,
and in a way they hadn't anticipated.  The new
StealthSurveilance Orbs were performing admirably.  Now all
Robotnik had to do was watch the audio/video downlink, and take
action at the proper time.

	One hour later, Sonic was becoming restless.  Belated thoughts
of danger and warnings passed through his mind.  This was the
time that the "what ifs" started a mental reign of terror.  What
if Sonic had missed something in his antisurveillance pass? 
What if Robotnik really was watching them?  What if...the
thought was too unsettling to finish in the privacy of his own
mind.
	"Uh, Sal," Sonic began, nervously, "are we going to get the
results anytime this century?"
	"I'm no closer to finishing than the last time you asked - five
seconds ago," Sally retorted.  "I don't even know if this
translation program will work, so I'm trying to give Nicole as
much data as possible to increase the language base she has to
work with.  Besides that, I've had to get Nicole to supply
partial power to the computers here just to get them to work. 
It hasn't been easy."
	Still somewhat nervous, and yet unwilling to interrupt Sally
any further, Sonic walked over what remained of the "top" of the
probe.  He quickly looked over the landscape with his
binoculars.  He looked out about five km, and saw no sign of
anything, organic or otherwise, besides Dulcy.  He directed his
IR/binocular unit visual sensor toward Dulcy.  She waved to him
to signal that they were still in her sights;  Sonic waved back
to acknowledge the signal.  Having nothing else to occupy his
time besides keeping watch, Sonic didn't know how much more
suspense he could take.
	Fortunately for Sonic, he wouldn't have to wait any longer. 
Sally had just finished scanning over the last bits of data they
could find for the translation program to use.  Nicole said the
key phrases that both of them had been waiting for: 
"Transcription complete.  Data currently saved to permanent
storage.  Executing language compiler."  The wait after then was
minute compared to the transcription phase, but it still
irritated Sonic's nerves.  "Translation complete.  Data prepared
for display purposes."
	"Display data," Sally commanded, relieved that the process was
over.
	The preliminary data that the probe had concerning the point of
origin and other location points were visible via the
holographic projection.  As Sally scrolled the data page down,
relief immediately converted to horror.  Noticing this sudden
change on Sally's face, Sonic jumped down from his guard
position to investigate the affair in detail.
	Sonic looked over to his close friend of eleven years, and
queried Sally on the sudden change of situation.  "What's up,
Sal?" he asked.
	Sally said nothing.  She looked as if she couldn't even trust
herself to speak.  When this only continued to provoke a
concerned response from Sonic, she handed Nicole to Sonic for
his personal investigation.  Most of the text and other video
was nothing more than useless technobabble to him, but he
understood enough to see why Sally had become so afraid of being
around the probe and its cargo.  A similar look spread over his
face, and he even began to feel a bit sick at the prospect.
	"You're telling me, Nicole," Sonic questioned, seeking
verification, "that this is a TIME MACHINE?"
	"In the crudest sense, the device is a time machine.  According
to the available data, the weapon was used to-"
	She was hastily interrupted by Sonic.  "Yes, yes, I got the
picture, Nicole," was the hedgehog's only response to the
halting the continuation of the more graphic contributions the
general utilization file had.  Toying with the space/time
continuum was something that gave him a headache, in more ways
than one.
	The Cassandrans had been wise to rid themselves of this weapon;
 only the probe was supposed to be destroyed in their star
system, not to crash-land on an alien planet where it was
possible for someone like Robotnik to get his hands on.  The
survival of the probe had destroyed their planet, so the probe
was the final connection to the Cassandrans' existence.  A
legacy that had to be destroyed before anything detrimental
could happen to other planets.  It was far too late for
Cassandra, but not so for Mobius, if Sonic and Sally acted fast.
	Finding her courage again, Sally managed to speak.  "Sonic,
this thing needs to be destroyed."
	"Gotcha, Sal.  So how?" the hedgehog ventured.
	"Well, first we need to get that protective cover off."  To
Nicole, she said, "Nicole, access data regarding the unloading
procedure."
	"Searching for required index," Nicole dictated.  After a
second of scanning over the permanent data storage unit, Nicole
found the requested file.  "Reading file, Sally."  A holographic
display appeared about two meters in front of Sally.
	"All right, Sonic," Sally said, "let's get to work.  First
locate the code latches along the base."
	They dove into the procedure, as per instructions translated by
Nicole.  They were that much closer to destroying the weapon.

* * *

	While the unloading process was going on at the probe's
location, Robotnik made the decision to move in.  He made a call
to his field commander, with a smile of accomplishment on his
face.  "Packbell!  Notify the other Hover Units.  We attack NOW!"
	Packbell acknowledged the message, and relayed it to all the
Hover Units.  Five seconds later, the fleet screamed toward the
probe with all available power.

* * *

	Right before Robotnik's arrival, Sonic and Sally were trying to
find the autodestruct key on the time machine.  They were unable
to commit themselves to any further searching, for Robotnik,
Packbell, and the entire Delta SWATBot Group were practically
face-to-face with them.  Before the two Freedom Fighters could
snap out of shock from Robotnik's sudden appearance, they were
apprehended by two SWATBots and bound together  back-to-back by
a security shackle.  Sonic and Sally struggled to escape, but
the electromagnetic field was too powerful to permit any hope of
departure.  Robotnik laughed his evil laugh of glee when he saw
the two attempt to escape.
	"It's no use, Hedgehog.  Your speed won't get you out of this
one very easily."  Robotnik was definitely enjoying this.  He
continued in his best poetic tone to Sally, "And you, Princess. 
Why do you struggle so?  It would only serve to bruise your
beautiful body, not to mention leave me with noone to be my
consort."
	Sally cringed visibly and spoke in her best acidic voice, "In
your dreams, Doctor!  I'll be your consort when you get a life!"
	"Oh, what a pity.  I thought that I might actually be able to
trust you two.  'Later', I thought," Robotnik said only in a
slightly derisive tone.  "Oh, and I almost forgot.  Thank you
for providing me with the information I need to the Key to
Mobius," he said, bowing in his most gracious bow.
	It was Sonic's turn to add a rebuttal.  "Yeah, we'll give you
the Key to Mobius, Robuttnik," Sonic replied with a sneer on his
face.  "We'll shove it down your throat after we use it to lock
you up in prison for good!"
	Slightly, but only slightly, taken aback by Sonic's comment,
Robotnik thought over what his next action should be.  Stroking
his mustache, he quickly thought of another way to deal with the
two brash young  Freedom Fighters.  Finding one, an evil smile
crept over his face, making it more than apparent to Sonic and
Sally that their fate would not be favorable to their survival.
	"Very well, then," he finally said to them.  "How about we make
a deal?"
	Sally spoke for herself and Sonic.  "We don't make deals with
criminals, Robotnik."
	"Wait until you hear the proposal, Princess," he said to Sally.
 After a thoughtful pause, he continued on.  "I challenge you to
determine your fate on your own.  If you, Hedgehog, are as fast
as you believe yourself to be-"
	An interruption by Sonic.  "Faster than you'll ever know,
Robotnik."
	"As I was saying," he continued, unflagged by Sonic's remark,
"if you're fast enough to escape from me, I'll make certain that
you are allowed to return to Knothole and warn your friends
about this weapon.  If not, well, let's just say you never will."
	Mutual shock emanated from Sonic and Sally.  It had to be a
trap, but what if Sonic was able to dash away from Robotnik's
Delta Group and safely return to Knothole.  The prospect stung
in Sonic's side, since it seemed to me more a question of pride
than anything else.  This was as Robotnik intended.
	"Sal, I gotta do it," Sonic whispered to his companion.
	"Right, Sonic," she answered back.  "You know as well as I do
that this could be a trick."
	Sonic resonated his voice to sound suave, and said, "Come on,
Sal.  I can outrun anything that Robuttnik has.  Trust me."
	"Oh, I hate it when you say that," was her only response.  She
consented to the challenge, however.
	"Excellent," said Robotnik in a voice that sounded like the cat
that was about to catch the canary.  "Now that we are in mutual
agreement, I shall let you perform your part of the bargain." 
To the SWATBots, he ordered, "Set them free."
	One second later, the EM field disengaged and the metal bar was
lifted from the prisoners.  Now free of the bonds, Sally quickly
jumped into Sonic's arms.  The hedgehog accelerated in place for
about a second, and then was somewhere else.
	Robotnik, however, wasn't about to let them escape so easily. 
He signaled to Packbell to engage the weapon.
	A yellow beam flashed between the temporal displacement final
emitter and Sonic's position.  In the distance, Robotnik could
hear the screams of the two, possibly the initial effects of the
time transport.  A few seconds later, they were present no more.

I saw this again today, and thought I'd offer my comments:

1.  Did Robotnik want to _control_ the planet, or _destroy_ it with
those pods?

2.  One scene showed the pods as metal frames which were then dipped in
some evil goop, then emerged as fully complete mechanisms.  Huh?

3.  A little _too_ convenient how the other teams were all captured...

4.  When S&S first joined the stones, I was kind of hoping for a "deus
ex machina" ending like that of "The Secret of NIMH", but it didn't
quite make it (although it was still nice).  It ended up reminding me
more of the end of "Animalympics" - "I can run forever if we can run
together!"

5.  So how long will that charge from the stones last, anyway?  :^)
(And what happened to them?)

6.  I _still_ can't believe it's been cancelled :^(

> >     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS 
> >[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

OK, here are a couple:

#22 [May 1995]

"The Return", written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante & Harvey M.

The story opens on S&S MWC (Sonic & Sally, Married With Children), but
this turns out to be the (supposedly) alternate Mobius seen in the "In
Your Face Special #1".  S&S are out with the kids one day when an
apparition of Robotnik appears then vanishes.  We then cut to a
satellite where Robotnik materializes and finds himself facing a video
image of a roboticized version of himself: on this Mobius, Robotnik
roboticized himself but still lost the "final battle" and uploaded his
mind to a satellite he had been constructing.  Unfortunately it wasn't
complete so all he can do is wait for his sytems to run down.

"Our" Robotnik assures him he will "evolve to the next level" (huh?)
and gets him to send him back to the "real" Mobius where it turns out
Snively has accidentally activated another version of Doomsday where
Robotnik would have Mobius destroyed if he ever lost.  (Note that in
the resulting battle Antoine exclaims "Mon Dieu!" - such language in a
children's comic...)  Robotnik arrives back just in time to shut down
"Operation Wasteland" mainly to keep the robots from destroying the
place and leaving him nothing to rule, but he also uses this as a
chance to shake up Sonic by noting that Sonic owes his life to
Robotnik.  At the end both sides realize they're at yet another
stalemate and the battle will continue another day...

"Tails' Knighttime Story!", written by Angelo Decesare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagastino

Tails is grumbling about Sonic's life being "non-stop fun and
excitement" while he "mostly stay[s] here and get[s] "baby-sat"".
Sally tells him a story with Sonic as a knight and Tails as his page to
illustrate the saying "never wish to be someone else until you have
fought a battle in his armor", but it doesn't quite work - Tails gets
the idea to borrow Sonic's sneakers so he can "really play Sonic".

Funny scene in the story Sally tells Tails:  "and he watched as Sir
Runalot won the hearts of the fairest maidens on Mobius!" - shows Sonic
in knight's armor on a moonlit bench holding Sally's hand (dressed in
maiden's costume) saying to Tails in page's clothes: "Yo!  How about
some privacy?"  Tails gets an embarrassed grin and replies "Sorry,
boss!", with beads of sweat running down his forehead... :^)

Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]

"Deadliest of the Species!", written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, Art by Art Mawhinney and Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice spash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renowned for his
military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's meeting
Geoffrey St. John (a skunk) in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility
and manage to beat them off and exchange some banter in the process (I
can't call it friendly, but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee-freedom fighters
are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for enemies and jumps
the pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally.  However, this
establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues
all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and after
battling SWATbots and ORB-bots, manages to destroy it.  During the
battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life, but he still doesn't trust him.
And maybe with good reason, since that night, when everybody else is
asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind
of building and descends into its basement, where he says to a figure
sleeping in a glass case: "Soon, m'luv... soon!"  The sleeping figure
is seen to be Sally???

This issue also contains a some fan art; two pics of Sally & Bunnie
(both NBD), and another one of Sally as a dominatrix (by a 13-year-old,
no less - sheesh...)

I _do_ like the direction the comic's going; if it keeps up, it will be
(almost) as good as having the show...

Madness takes its toll. The answer, however illogical, is both. Control 
what you can, and destroy that which you can't.

Biotechnology, or at least, nanites.

The Redshirt Syndrome strikes again! (cf: Star Trek)

Reminds me of the DC Alternate Universes, specificly the one where 
Superman and Lois Lane marry and actually have a daughter- Superlass...

I wish I'd known about these comics much earlier- I'd be a bit more 
involved... (Same goes for the show...)

This story, "Vixen in the Labyrinth", is an interesting adventure in 
Robotropolis that does have some very moving parts depending on what 
frame of mind you're in.

Anyway, the story follows my sig. so enjoy!

I'd like to start out by saying, this story is from before Robotnik was
defeated. Plus I'd like to thank CamCoon, who really brightened my day
with his response to "Bunnie's Bad Day", Bookshire, who happens to be the
best storyteller around, and I'd also like to say to a certain "Nefaria"
that I would love it if he sent me more pictures. Clean ones that is. 

On wit da storwee...
__________________________________________________________
"VIXEN IN THE LABYRINTH" by Holly-Beth Vixie Kraft (my real name)

	It was a typical Knothole day. Tails was outside playing with
Sonic. Sally and Bunnie were talking and figuring out things on Nicole.
Rotor stood in his workshop, and Dulcy was asleep. Antoine happened to be
on lookout that day, and he was getting very t ired.
	To no one in particular, he spoke. "Sacre bleu cheese! Zees es
soooooo boreeng...Ah I know! Oui Oui, yes I will take a break for zome
loonsh. Zat weel get me goeeng!"
	Antoine smiled and walked over to the edge of the lookout post to
reach his sandwich. Unfortunately, there was a loose board, and Antoine,
being himself, tripped over it, making him squash face first into his
calamari dish.
	Sonic and Tails had happened to be looking at Antoine when he
fell, and they were rolling on the forest floor, laughing. As soon as they
had calmed down, they ran up the ladder to help him.
	"Why Ant, why I think squid makes a statement for you!" Sonic sneered.
	Tails fell down again and laughed.
	"I am not thinkeeng zees was funny! Stop laughing!" Antoine said
with malice as he picked off his lunch.
	"Chill Ant, I just came to tell you that your shift is over, you
can go back to Knothole." Sonic smiled.
	"Hmph...I knew this! You cannot knit wool over mah eyes!" Antoine
said matter-of-factly.
	"Good, then go! Dulcy takes over from here!" Sonic then whistled
for Dulcy. It never failed to bring her attention. Hearing it, she got up
and flew to the lookout.
	"Hi Sonic! Hi Tails! Hi...uh..Tony." paused Dulcy, "Um, Antoine, if
you don't mind me asking, what happened to you?"
	"He was attacked by a killer squid!" giggled Tails.
	Sonic laughed. "C'mon Tails, let's go see what your ol' Aunt Sal
is doing with Bunnie."
	"Okay Sonic! Bye Dulcy!" barked Tails, as he climbed down the tree.
	Antoine was close behind him as he and Sonic left.

	"Hey, Sal. What's cookin?" said Sonic as he and Tails walked into
the hut.
	"Hi Sonic, we're just working on a plan to sabotage one of power
plants in Robotropolis." replied Sally.
	"Plus we're workin' with Nicole here to find out why I've been
sleep-walking!" added Bunnie.
	"Sleep-walking?" said Tails.
	"Mm-hm. I keep going over to the Power Ring Pool in the middle of
the night, for reasons Sally-girl is trying ta find out!"
	"I'm pretty sure it has to do with a dream you might have had."
Sally said to the side of the ongoing conversation.
	"Anyway, what's the ol' plan?"
	"Well, there's a cargo shuttle containing fuel and oil that we'll
sabotage on the way in. When we overtake the Swat-bots on the inside, we
can lead the shuttle into the Doomsday Area."
	"Way cool plan, Sal. Tails can come, right?"
	"Sonic, I don't think..."
	"Good! That's good! You don't think! Okay, so Tails can come with
me!" Sonic grinned mischievously.
	Sally sighed. "So immature..."
	"Can I, Aunt Sally?"
	"Sure Tails, but you are going to be careful, right?"
	"Of course, Aunt Sally!" Tails smiled.
	"Okay."
	"Yes! Past cool, big guy! C'mon, let's get ready." Sonic said
motioning to his admirer.
	"Yeah!"

	"Snively, have you placed that false file about the cargo ship into
the Swat-bots?" Dr. Robotnik growled.
	"Yes sir. The freedom fighters have already downloaded it from a
Stealth-bot this morning."
	"Good, Snively. Very good."
	"Thank you sir."
	"Now once I have that rodent in my vicinity, we'll invite him and
his little friends on a trip to my labyrinth."
	"Labyrinth, sir?" questioned Snively.
	"Oh yes. It's a complex maze I have made especially for that
blasted blue burden. Once inside, I will persuade him to find the center
of the maze. Of course, I'll tell him I will set him and his friends free
when they reach the center, but in the center of my little labyrinth, is
really...a Roboticizer!" and with this, the evil Doc laughed. 

	The next day, Sonic and his friends were packing up to go to
Robotropolis. It was going to be a tough journey since it had began to
rain as they headed off. Sonic took Sally and Bunnie on each of his arms
while Tails flew alongside Dulcy, who was carryi ng an extremely petrified
Antoine on her back.
	When they all reached Robotropolis, they began the journey to the
power plant. Smog smothered it. Probably because of over usage.
	Sally checked the coordinates from Nicole with the ones she had stolen. According to Nicole, they were right on target.
	"C'mon you guys, get inside!" Sally whispered.
	All the Freedom Fighters continued within, when suddenly a giant
monitor came to life before the steel door slammed shut behind them.
	On the screen was Robotnik.
	"Welcome, Welcome!" he sneered, "I see you found my little false
file in that stealth bot you overtook this morning?"
	"I knew it Robutthead! You're always a snake." Sonic shouted.
	"Oh really? Well, I have another surprise for you. I am pairing you
up with three other Freedom Fighters, on a trip..through my labyrinth..."
	"What's the deal Moon-head?" Bunnie cried.
	"Oh, it's a lovely little maze I designed for all of you. In it,
there are traps, tricks, and treachery! If you make it to the center of
the labyrinth, I guess I'll be able to set you free. That IS if you can
make it to the center."
	"Don't be so sure about that, Robo-geek. This is one way past cool
hedgehog you're talking to. Don't count on us being stopped." Sonic said
with certitude.
	Robotnik chuckled. "We'll see, rodent...we'll see."
	And with that, the floor dropped out from beneath all the Freedom
Fighters, leaving them to a high domed maze. Beside them, were the three
other Freedom Fighters Robotnik was talking about. All three were girls.
	The first, a fox about Tails' age, stood up. "I'm Vixie Lamenta,
Freedom Fighter of Northbreeze. This is Zip," she said pointing to a
hedgehog about the same age as Sally, "and this is Annie." she finished,
motioning to a young hedgehog, who was younger than all of them.
	"I guess you're our partners through the labyrinth?" said Zip.
	"I guess so," replied Sally, becoming slightly jealous of Zip.
	"Well, let's get this thing over with." said Sonic.
	Vixie walked over to Tails.
	"Why do you have two?" she asked.
	"You mean tails? I don't know."
	"Is that bad?" pondered Vixie.
	"No. I can fly with them." Tails smiled proudly.
	"Oh, cool!" she said.
	Tails was beginning to like Vixie. In fact, her darker red fur was
very appealing. Like Bunnie, she had a little tuft of hair between her
ears, which made her look at least twelve.
	"How'd you get caught..uh.."
	"Tails, call me Tails."
	"...Tails."
	"Robotnik tricked us into a mission to destroy a power plant." he
paused for a moment, "How did you get caught?" Tails wondered.
	"Robotnik was getting ready to Roboticize my parents, with Zip and
Annie's. He didn't seem to notice us escape, until we got caught in a heat
duct."
	"Why didn't he just Roboticize you three?" wondered Tails.
	"He said that we would need a little extra punishment for
postponing the inevitable. So he shoved us here." the vixen answered.
	"That's too bad."
	"Yeah..."
	The group of Freedom Fighters walked on inside the maze. Tails
held Vixie by her hands and lifted her in the air.
	As the rest of the fighters walked on, Annie tugged on Zip's arm.
	"Zippy? Are Mama and Daddy gone?" she asked.
	Zip looked down at her little sister. "Yes."
	"When will they come back?" she persisted.
	"Annie, they're not coming back. Robotnik roboticized them."
	Annie sighed heavily for a six year old hedgehog.
	Sally and Sonic had watched the whole thing, and Sonic held Sally
a little tighter as they walked.
	Soon they came upon a fork in the maze. One of the forks was lined
in red, and the other yellow.
	"Which way, Sally-girl?" asked Bunnie.
	"Well," said Sally, taking out Nicole, "Let me try to see which way
is safer."
	Nicole then proceeded to scan the area.
	"Scan shows sign of heavy bot patrol in the red sector, Sally."
droned Nicole.
	"Yellow." blurted Sally.
	The group moved down the yellow path.
	Dulcy was beginning to get nervous. Her claustrophobia was even
stronger now, since the yellow path was smaller in height.
	Antoine, as usual, was worse off than Dulcy.
	Suddenly, Zip heard something. She began to get ready to juice up, just 
like Sonic, only her feet began to glow.
	Just then, she darted off ahead of the troupe. She then commenced
to blow away Swat-bots with lasers that were attached to the bracelets on
her arms.
	It was at that time, that Tails noticed Vixie had a bracelet too.
And he began to fly over the bots, letting Vixie fire from above.
	Dulcy took on a trio of Stealth-bots by freezing them with her icy
breath.
	Antoine tried his best to use his "king-fu" to stop a particular
Swat-bot that had the little squire on it's mind. Ant was losing, so Rotor
and Bunnie came in and finished it off.
	Annie jumped into Sally's arms, full of fear.
	Sally ran off to the side of the tunnel, where she began to calm
the little girl down.
	Rotor had been pulling out the main wire consoles of the bots he
had ambushed, putting the parts in his utility belt. Probably will be
helpful later, he thought.
	Bunnie just began punching the bots out of her way, or kicking
them with her powerful robotic legs.
	At last, the Swat-bot team was finished.
	Proud of their victory, they cheered.
	Robotnik, who had been watching all along, began to chuckle
subtly. He then brought out his microphone.
	The Freedom Fighters stopped and stared at a descending monitor.
	"Very good, my little Freedom Fighters. Did you think that was
easy?" Robotnik scoffed.
	"Piece of cake, Robuttnik!" shouted Vixie.
	"Oh, is that so, little vixen? We'll see about that." the evil
doctor smiled.
	With that, the monitor withdrew.
	Instantly, the Freedom Fighters began tumble to the ground from a
large tremor that had just begun. After looking behind them, they noticed
that the yellow cavern was caving in.
	"Sonic! We've got to get out of here!" Sally yelled over the rumbling.
	"Grab on you guys!" said Sonic to Bunnie, Sally, and Antoine.
	After they did what they were told, Sonic shot down the tunnel.
	Dulcy was making sure Tails, Vixie, Rotor, and the other two
hedgehogs were secured on her back. When everyone was set, she cracked the
whip, which sent the six Freedom Fighters screaming through the yellow
corridor. It wasn't long before she had caught up with Sonic.
	"Sonic! I see a light up ahead!" shouted Bunnie.
	As soon as Sonic heard that, he knew what to do.
	"Slap me some power, Sal!" he said.
	Sally proceeded to grab a power ring from Sonic's backpack.
	She looked over to Dulcy, "Prepare to crack the whip again, Dulcy!"
	"Got ya Sal!" came her reply.
	Sally handed the ring to Sonic.
	After an initial power surge, Sonic shot off, dragon right behind
him.
	When they made it to the light, the tunnel had already begun to
gain on them, and was nearly ready to fall on top of them.
	At last, they emerged from the tunnel.
	"We made it you guys! We did it!" shouted Vixie.
	"Ha! No problem." crowed Sonic.
	Robotnik's great monitor then showed up.
	"No problem, Sonic Hedgehog? My, what an aspiration we have. Well
I've only one more trick up my sleeve, and that, my dear boy, is my worst
yet. Are you all set?" Robotnik grumbled.
	"You bet your gut on it." Sonic grinned readily.
	"Ah...I'm glad. Farewell, Sonic Hedgehog. You were such a dirty
little rodent."
	Suddenly, the monitor disappeared.
	Rotor walked up to Sonic. "What do you think he has planned for us
next?"
	"I don't know Rote, but I don't think I'm gonna like it." Sonic
confessed.
	"Lookie!" shouted Annie.
	Before the party were two more hedgehogs.
	"Mama?! Papa?!" exclaimed Zip.
	"What happened?" Annie cried.
	"DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS, BY ORDER OF ROBOTNIK!" the parents droned.
	"Oh Tails! I can't believe it..." Vixie said as she began to cry
softly.
	"What?" said Tails as two more Roboticized individuals stepped out
into the room.
	"He's...he's torturing us!" Vixie sobbed.
	The roboticized individuals were Vixie's parents.
	"No..." she whispered softly.
	Vixie the fell into Tails' arms, crying.
	"Mama, Papa, please, we're only trying to help you!" shouted Zip.
	Annie was crying.
	"DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS, BY ORDER OF ROBOTNIK!" they droned.
	Sally turned to Sonic. "We've got to get them out of here. They'll
be lured into his trap!"
	"Okay, hang on." Sonic replied, putting out his arms for Sally to
jump into.
	He then began to race around the room, diverting the attention of
the parents.
	"HEDGEHOG! PRIORITY ONE! PRIORITY ONE!" they shouted monotonously.
	Bunnie had already caught on to Sonic's plan, and she rushed to
gather up Annie, Vixie, and Zip. After telling them a few things, she ran
over to Rotor, girls following behind her.
	"Rotor, I think there's a door over there! Try an see if y'all can
open it. We've gotta get these kids out of here!"
	"Onto it Bunnie!" said Rotor.
	Rotor then ran to the door. He noticed a number keypad to open the
door, so he searched his utility belt. Finding the wire consoles, he then
began to reprogram the door. In less than one minute, the door was open.
	"Good old sugar!" Bunnie smiled as she gathered her companions and
ran into the door.
	When the only people left were Sonic and Sally, Bunnie then
whistled for Sonic to head into the room.
	As soon as he and Sally arrived inside the room, the door shut
behind them.
	All was dark.
	"Welcome to the center of my Labyrinth." said a voice, "Now I guess
I'll have to set you free."
	The lights jolted on.
	"NO!!" Sonic shouted.
	Standing in front of him were Roboticizers built for each one of
the party. Below them, were the names of the Freedom Fighters, engraved in
gold.
	"Game......OVER!" shouted Robotnik, standing next to the one marked
"Sonic."
	Swat-bots then cornered the group and began to take each
individual to their roboticizer. The bots had just finished putting in
Vixie when suddenly Dulcy began to belch loudly. When she burped, Dulcy
emitted smoke and she planned on getting everyone out of there.
	Robotnik began to yell.
	"ACTIVATE! ACTIVATE IT YOU TWITS!" he shouted at his bots.
	Just as the group escaped, Tails watched the Roboticizer beam up.
	"VIXIE!" he cried.
	Suddenly, Vixie began to be enveloped in a yellow beam.
	"No! No! NO!" Tails shouted.
	Sonic grabbed Tails' arm. "C'mon! We've got to find a way out of
here!"
	"I'm not leaving without..."
	It was done.
	"...Vixie." he whispered.
	Sonic took Tails by the hand and shot off through a wall. The rest
followed him. 

	"She's gone! I can't believe she's gone!" sobbed Tails when they
arrived at Knothole, "I'll never see her again!"
	Sonic looked down.
	"I'm sorry, Tails, but we couldn't have saved her anyway. It was
too late!"
	"It's my fault Tails." said a voice.
	"Dulcy?" Tails looked up.
	"It was a stupid plan. I should have gone over it with the rest of
you. It's all my fault." she replied softly.
	"It's okay Dulcy. We had to act for ourselves. I don't blame you
for a thing." Tails cried softly.
	"What's wrong guys?" said a voice from behind them.
	"VIXIE?!" they all shouted.
	"It's me!" said the little vixen.
	"How did you escape? I saw you roboticized!" said Tails frantically.
	"Back in Northbreeze, I was voted the town's best scientist. I had
a spare model of myself in my backpack which I let the Swat-bots think was
me. Robotnik Roboticized a robot!" she explained.
	Tails ran up to Vixie.
	"I'm just glad you're okay." he said.
	And with that, he laid a kiss on her cheek.
	Vixie blushed, then hugged Tails.
	"I thought I'd never see you again!" said Tails.
	"I'm right here! Smile! You'll be able to see me as often as you
want."
	"Yeah?"
	"Of course!" Vixie paused, "Tails, you're the best friend I've ever
had. I'm glad I made it out alive. I could have never been able to live
without a friendship like ours."
	"We haven't known each other for very long, Vixie."
	"Well, still, you've proven to be an asset in my life. In
Northbreeze, I had no friends. No one. You've introduced me to friendship,
and I think I like it very much."
	"Well, I'll always be here for you." said Tails.
	Bunnie took this time to interrupt the two foxes. "Supper time,
sweethearts! Y'all don't want to starve, do you?"
	 With a smile Tails ran towards the dining hall. Leaving Vixie behind.
	"C'mon!" he shouted.
	"I'll be right there Tails!" said Vixie as she watched everyone
leave. Turning around to face Robotropolis, she whispered.
	"I love you Mama, I love you daddy."

Well, we could theorize about what those glowing red eyes at the end of 
"The Doomsday Project" were supposed to be attached to.  Personally, I'm 
kinda fond of them being some version of MetalSonic's, if only because he 
hadn't been seen in the cartoon...

I kinda suspected they were Knuckle's eyes.  That's how they kept doing the
ads for Sonic 3.  Besides...  We have't seen him either in the TV show.

Is it me or did Snivley curl his eyebrows after coming out of hiding?

Okay, I'm feeling kinda sat 'bout this, and am prob'ly refusing to accept
reality, but has there been any OFFICIAL word as whether or not StH will
appear next season?

I know some of us have seen various articles and posts saying the worst, but
I was just wonderin' if ABC, DiC, or anybody else involved with the program
had mentioned anything.

Switching subjects (slightly) here, I'm remembering that message that someone
forwarded from r.a.a that was by one of the guys involved with the afternoon
cartoon.  It said that they did the whole she-bang in one year and apparently
have not done anything since.

Just for debate, I would think that creating a show in such a manner ought
to make it better, story-wise.  I mean, you start out knowing exactly how
many episodes there'll be, so you go about writing the story, start, middle,
finish, sorta like one long mini-series.  Then, in case you do in fact go
back to the studio, you can leave one little exit in the final episode to
continue with.

I believe this is how the original TMNT syndicated series was written, since
there actually were characters that came and went recurringly (assuming
you could find a TV station that would play them in order!), but apparently
this was not the case for TAoStH.

Again, just for debate, I ask the question:  What went wrong?

Well, you said it was a little quiet!

Hi guys!

In regard to the posts speculating about the red-eyed
unidentifiable that Snively was with (end of "The Dooms-
day Project"), would anyone be adverse if I personally
took a stab at it?  I've wanted to do a "Doomsday aftermath"
for the past week, but I've been busy working on "The Temp-
oral Syndrome" (which is, by the way, nearing completion).
Does anyone else REALLY want to take the story, or will I be
permitted to do so?  Please send in your votes ASAP!

Go write ahead.  I've got a "Doomsday Aftermath" idea running about in my 
head which I should write up in a month or two, and I've been at a loss 
to make a guess as to what that thing is.
At present, I'm working on "The Mobius Mystery" which occurs before Doomsday.
I've also got one other "Doomsday Aftermath" story in the works.  
Although I don't know how much of an aftermath it would be since it takes 
place ten years in the future.  I have no idea when I'll have that one ready.

Anyway, That's my vote.  Go ahead and write it.

Well, I just heard on AOL that the long awaited newsgroup exists.

It called alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.  Actually I forget if thats a dash or a 
period, but I think its a dash.  Anyway, for those of you with newsgroup 
access, feel free to stop by.  In fact, I would appriciate it if someone 
would tell me if they can even get it yet.  My newsreader apparently 
hasn't figured out it's there yet.  If it doesn't mention it in the next 
few days, I'm going to kill my SysOp.

I don't know. The first time I saw them (and the second time too) they 
looked familiar. Then I realized. Some of the promotional artwork for 
Sonic 3 had Knuckles hiding in a bush, with just his eyes showing. The 
eyes were _exactly_ the same shape as the eyes on Doomsday. My theory is 
that they planned to intro Knuckles in the third season.

Issue #22 finally made it to my local stores, or at least an 
out-of-my-way store I decided to try.

Anyone notice in Sonic-Grams another explanation for Tails's two tails?  
He was simply born that way (for no apparent reason) which contradicts 
their explanation in #16 (Antonie gave his tail to Tails).

I also noticed that the story in #22 depends upon one having read a 
number of past issues (good thing I have read them (g)).  They also 
mentioned Crabmeat, and I know who that is only because I recently 
received my order for #1 through #7.

(Skip this paragraph if you haven't read #22 and don't want to know 
anything about the story beforehand.)
At this point, Sonic and Sally with kids is too much of a non-sequitor to 
me at this point.  Over time, the story could be developed so that they 
do, but not now.  Anyone notice the offspring was of two species (just 
like Sonic and Sally are of two species).

So far, a.f.s-h does not appear on either USIT or Delphi; I've not tried Nyx
yet.  It's rather uncertain if Delphi would pick up this group, but USIT and
Nyx probably would.  I know some list members can't get alt groups, and I did
raise that issue during the re-proposal of the newsgroup.  From what I've read
about the group on the list, at least no one's really missing anything (yet).

I just saw "Heads or Tails" for the 1st time  today...I was wondering if anyone
knows WHY the artwork is so much different from the other shows?  In fact,
it wasn't just the artwork...the whole episode seemed like a flashback to 
(dare I say it) the weekday show.   The plot was more "fluff" than 
action/adventure,
and I found myself very disgusted with the poor artwork...yes, poor artwork. 
 I don't
mind change, but I HATE a change for the worse.
     The characters looked younger,  and the general dialogue  concetrated 
on setting and exposition of the characters...  (Was this the first episode 
ever?)
     Here's hoping for a future contract renewal...I  miss the show already.

Struck me the same way, too.

Then again, that whole first season was kind of...shaky.  You knew they
had characters and a premise, but you felt that they were unsure what to
do with them.  This state of affairs was reflected in the fact that they
used a different writer(s) EVERY WEEK!  Guarantees that things will be a
little uneven.  For me, there were only a few eps that stood up on their
own: Sonic and Sally (by the second season team of Allee and Hurst) and
Sonic's Nightmare come to mind.

This may be a chance to confirm some scuttlebutt concerning why Sonic
got axed:

According to one source, who says he read it on r.a.a, it turns out that
DiC supposedly put some Sonic cels on the market, an action at which
Sega took umbrage (can you say "anal retentive?").  Words were
exchanged, and that's why Sonic didn't get renewed.

This makes for a good story, but I'm enough of a skeptic to have my
doubts.  Besides, I have the responsibility of doing quality control on
a FAQ File.  So before I go putting an account of the incident in the
file, I need a source, preferably in print.  Let me know if it's out
there.

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 3

     "I wish Sonic was here."
     Sally took her cloak and wrapped it tighter against herself
as she sat closer to the small fire she had built.  The wind was
picking up in the bottom of the canyon.
     Above her, growing from the floor of the canyon like some
improbable stone plant, loomed Dragonsnest.  It had been the
center of dragon civilization on Mobius centuries before, but the
number of dragons had been in decline even before Robotnik's
takeover, and the few dragons who had evaded capture were in
hiding.
     Sally and Sonic had agreed to a compromise: Sonic would
transport her close to Dragonsnest and then leave.  Which he did
with obvious reluctance.  Sally had no idea who or what was
waiting for her, but it was clear she had to meet it alone.  No
matter how much she disliked the prospect.
     She leaned her back against the stone tower, listening for
any sound that might come her way.  It was not fear, however,
that caused her to wish for Sonic's company.  It was loneliness,
a loneliness made even more profound in a deserted stone canyon,
waiting for moonrise.  
     Thirty feet away, hidden in the darkness, a small figure
crouched behind a massive boulder.  It was Sonic.  Sally may have
told him to go back to Knothole, he told himself, but she didn't
say anything about not doubling back at the first opportunity to
keep an eye on her.  Besides, someone had to make sure that the
Knothole freedom fighters didn't lose the brains of the outfit. 
Satisfied that what he thought he'd heard was just the wind,
Sonic continued his vigil.
     OK, he told himself, maybe he'd feel the same way if someone
came up to him and told him he had a chance of finding his own
mother.  Like *that* had a chance of happening!  For as far back
as he could remember he'd been an orphan, living with his Uncle
Chuck.  Until the day Robotnik took over Mobius and he went to
live in Knothole.  Still, why was Sally doing this by herself?
Sally's usually way cautious, Sonic told himself, but sometimes
she could be so...
     Sonic's thoughts were interrupted as someone or something
grabbed him from behind.  Sonic wasn't used to being lost in
thought, but the figure had crept up on him absolutely
undetected.  The figure then hauled Sonic to a standing position
while Sonic felt the tip of some kind of knife being pressed
against his throat.
     "Is this your idea of following instructions?" the stranger
called out to Sally...in Sally's voice!
     "What are you...No!"
     "You were told to come alone!"
     "I didn't know he was following me, I swear!"
     "Hold it right there," the stranger said, for Sally had
begun running toward them and was now about ten feet away.  "You
know this busybody?"
     "His name's Sonic.  He's my friend...."
     "Looks like you've picked a friend who couldn't be trusted."
     "That's not true!  I've trusted him with my life more times
than I can count.  We fight together against Robotnik."
     "I'm not interested in your little war."  The figure paused.
There was no way to read her thoughts, for her face was once
again hidden behind a veil.  "So you trust this fool with your
life.  Let's see how far that trust extends."
     With that, the figure took the knife away from Sonic's
throat, and with the other hand produced a coiled length of rope
from under her cloak.  She tossed it to Sally, who caught it
before it hit the ground.
     "If you're truly familiar with royal customs, you know how
to put someone under protection."
     Sally didn't say anything to the stranger.  Instead, she
deftly tied one end of the rope into a slip knot and placed her
head through the loop.  She handed the other end to the stranger,
then gave Sonic the center section of the rope to hold.  All the
time she kept her eyes on the stranger.
     "I'm impressed," the stranger said.  "You've remembered
something that has long been forgotten.  I accept your offer,"
she said as she let the rope drop.  Sally then took the loop from
around her neck.
     The stranger coiled up the rope and replaced it under her
cloak.  Then, taking a half-burned log from the fire and using it
as a torch, she led Sonic and Sally into Dragonsnest.
     "Yo, Sal, what was that all about?" Sonic whispered.
     "It's an ancient rite that I learned about.  The royal
family of Mobius had the right to intervene and show mercy to
someone who might have committed a crime.  That ceremony with the
rope was my way of saying that I'm willing to be held accountable
for your actions."
     "What do you mean, 'accountable'?"
     "If you transgress, you go free and she has the right to
kill me."
     "Say what!?"
     "No talking!" the stranger called out.  "And that means no
questions as well.  You'll have your answers soon enough,
anyway."
     Most dragons prefer to nest in the open, yet the ancient
tower was shot through with interior nurseries and storerooms. 
It was to one of these that the stranger led Sonic and Sally.
     The room was more like a barren cave.  Several ancient
dragon's egg shells lay in a corner, lit by a low fire in the
center of the room.  In another corner, Sally could see the dim
outline of someone laying on a straw mat.  The person's breathing
was steady but mechanical, as if a machine were doing the
breathing for them. 
     The stranger threw her log torch on the fire.  It flared up,
and both Sally and Sonic gasped in alarm.  The figure on the mat
was mostly robot--only her head and right arm had been spared.  
     "Who is that?" Sally asked in a shocked whisper.
     "Our mother."
     "OUR mother?"
     The figure undid her face veil and slipped her cloak hood
off her head.  Neither Sonic nor Sally could believe it.  The
figure looked exactly like Sally.  There was, however, something
in the darkness of the eyes, the hard set of the mouth.  This was
a person who had seen too much too soon.
     "We are twin sisters, you and I.  My name is Sandy.  And
SHE...she was once Queen Alicia of Mobius."
     "But...but what's she doing here?"
     "She's dying."

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog Story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 4



     Sally had, from her earliest days, been groomed as the
successor to the throne of Mobius by her father.  In her had been
cultivated the arts and virtues of leadership.  It was now that
they would be put to the test.
     "Sandy, she can't stay here.  Whatever's wrong with her, she
may have a chance if we can get her to Knothole."
     "But she can't endure hard travel, and that's what faces us
in crossing the Great Plain.  We'd need about five days to get to
Knothole on foot."  As Sandy spoke these last words, she gave
Sally a look that told her what she was afraid to ask: Sandy
didn't think that their mother had five days left.
     "Sonic, you've got to get back to Knothole.  Tell Dulcy to
get here as fast as she can."
     "You sure about this, Sal?"
     "Sonic, there's no other way!"
     "Wait; who's Dulcy?"
     "I'll tell you later, Sandy.  Then you've got to get a
message to Uncle Chuck; have him come to Knothole at once.  He's
the only one who has the kind of knowledge we need.  We'll also
need a place for her to stay; we can use my hut."
     The hedgehog's usual bravado was gone; the situation was
way too serious.  With a simple "Hang in there, Sal," he was on
his way.
     Only after Sonic had left on his errands did Sally cross to
the shadowy figure and kneel beside her.  Sandy did the same and
touched the figure on the shoulder.
     "Mother," Sandy said softly, "Mother, she's here."
     The figure slowly turned her head toward them.  The face was
sunken, pale and etched with pain.  Whatever disease she was
fighting against had already exacted a terrible price, and would
soon demand payment in full.  Yet Sally could plainly see her own
face in that of the one lying before her.  And even now, so close
to death, Sally could see a hint of what had once been great
beauty in the face of the sufferer.  Sally had never thought of
herself as beautiful--even if she were to admit it, it wouldn't
have been seemly to do so--but she could see it in this person,
whoever she was.  The possibility that this frail sufferer could
indeed be her mother was now impossible to ignore.
     The figure slowly opened her eyes and looked at Sally.  It
seemed that it took her a while to focus her gaze.  Then, she
slowly reached up and caressed Sally's cheek.  Tears began to
well up in her eyes, and the corners of the parched mouth turned
upward.
     "Sally...my lost child..." was all she could manage in a
congested whisper of a voice.
     Sally started to call her "Mother," choked on the word, then
collapsed on the figure's metallic breast, pouring out the sorrow
she had carried for so many years.  It was some minutes before
Sally could pull herself together enough to speak: "I never knew
what happened to you.  I thought...I didn't know WHAT to think!"
     "We were supposed to have been killed," Sandy said, her
voice full of controlled rage, "and we would have been if
Robotnik had had his way."
     "But what happened to you?  And how did you ever find me?"
     "I'll leave the first question for now--it's too long a
story.  As for finding you, we almost didn't.
     "It was about three months ago that the Nomads we were
travelling with brought in a stranger: someone from the East who
seemed too eager to purchase weapons that the Nomads had their
eye on.  I overheard the conversation between the Nomad chiefs
and this stranger who called himself 'Dirk.'"
     "I know a Dirk!  He's the leader of the Eastern band of
freedom fighters."
     "That's what he admitted, after some questioning and after
swearing the Nomad elders to secrecy.  Even then I don't think I
would have been interested until he spoke of a 'Princess Sally'
who was leading another group of fighters.
     "Mother had spoken of you often, so I knew the name.  She
told me how we had been separated after we had been born, and how
she and I had to leave Mobotropolis.  On a chance, I cornered
Dirk after he'd left the elders.  I kept my veil in place so he
couldn't have known why I was so interested in this 'Princess
Sally.'  I could only learn from him that you lived in the Great
Forest, in some hidden place called Knothole.  Then I let him go.
     "At that time, Mother's health was beginning to seriously
deteriorate.  When I told her what I had learned from Dirk, it
was as if she'd been given a new life.  She had to see if you
were still alive, so we abandoned the Nomads and began travelling
to the Great Forest.  We stopped frequently and made as good time
as possible.  Finally, Mother became so weak that I feared to
take her any further; that's when we arrived here.  I vowed I'd
find you and bring you to Mother.
     "I arrived at the Great Forest not knowing where to begin,
and then I spied your watchtower.  I thought I'd hide myself
until someone showed up, then I'd follow them back to Knothole. 
The first one to show up...well, I was surprised to find someone
else who was...."
     "What?"
     In answer, Sandy rose and tossed aside her cloak.  Her right
arm, from her shoulder to her fingertips, had been roboticized. 
"Robotnik did this to me when I was four years old.  I'll always
remember the look on his face when he did it--the joy he took
from reducing a living being to some kind of machine.  You saw
what he did to Mother--he changed her piece by piece.  It was
painful, and it took months.  He called it 'science;' I call it
torture!"
     Sally was stunned, not so much by Sandy's roboticized arm as
by the hatred with which she spoke.  "You...you must have seen
Bunnie," she managed to say.
     "I guess that was her name.  Anyway, I also saw one of
Robotnik's crafts pull up next to her on the platform.  I didn't
hear the craft until it was too late; he must be using some kind
of silencer on the engine."
     "Never mind that; what happened?  Bunnie tells me you
started fighting the SWAT-bots single-handed."
     "The only worthwhile things I learned from my years with the
Nomads were their ancient fighting techniques.  That's one of the
reasons Robotnik has managed to leave the Nomads alone all these
years, and how we've stayed hidden from them.  I made short work
of the bots--it's easy if you know how," she added as an aside. 
"Then I waited for Bunnie to come to, for she'd fallen and was
unconscious.  When she called me by your name, I knew I had found
you."
     "Hey, Sally!  You in here?" someone called out from the
corridor.
     "In here, Dulcy!" Sally answered.
     "You never did say who this Dulcy is."
     "She's our ticket back to Knothole, and..."
     "Hi!"
     Sandy turned and found herself looking into the face of a
dragon.  An adolescent dragon, to be sure, but it was still
something she hadn't counted on seeing.  Sandy immediately drew a
curved Nomad knife from its sheath.
     "Hey, hold it!" Dulcy protested.  "I'm on your side!"
     "Sandy, this is Dulcy.  She's going to fly us back to
Knothole."
     "You've made friends with a dragon?"
     "Pleased to meet ya!" Dulcy said as she extended a claw. 
Sandy replaced the knife, turned and walked back to where Queen
Alicia lay.
     "Is that your Ma?" Dulcy asked.
     "Yes, and that's my twin sister, Sandy."
     "Oh, wow, I didn't know you had a twin sister!"
     "Neither did I, until tonight."
     "Oh, yeah.  Well, we better get going."
     Sally and Sandy carefully bundled up their mother, then
placed her inside the pouch on Dulcy's abdomen.
     "You're going to be OK, ma'am," Dulcy said as she was tucked
in, then she spoke to the girls: "You two can saddle up once we
get outside, the ceilings are too low in here."
     Leaving the fire to die out on its own, they made their way
out onto one of the open ledges that served as nesting sites. 
Sally had only just shown Sandy how to sit in the two-seated
saddle on Dulcy's back when the dragon stepped off of the ledge
and began falling.  Before anyone could say anything, Dulcy had
spread her wings and caught an updraft from the canyon.  A few
seconds later Dragonsnest was just a fading blur on the horizon
behind them.
     "Hey, Sandy!" Dulcy called back.  "You're doing pretty good!
You ever ridden a dragon before?"
     "I've never even SEEN a dragon before!"  It was obvious from
her tone that she'd rather be doing anything else at the moment.
     "Look!" Sally called out.  "That's the edge of the Great
Forest up ahead!  We'll be in Knothole before long."
     Actually, this wasn't the part of the journey that Sally was
looking forward to, for she knew what Sandy and her mother didn't
know: that Dulcy's landings needed a lot of work.  That was the
strongest argument against using Dulcy to carry the Queen to
Knothole, but the alternatives weren't any better.
     Soon they were skimming over the trees.  After several
minutes, Sally pointed out some lights fluttering through the
foliage below, then a fire-lit clearing where Dulcy would land. 
Sally braced herself for one of Dulcy's usual clumsy landings. 
She began reproaching herself for the plan but stopped when Dulcy
said: "We're here!"  Sally hadn't felt a thing.
     Sliding off of the saddle on Dulcy's back, Sally and Sandy
lifted their mother from Dulcy's pouch and placed her onto a
makeshift stretcher.  Bunnie and Rotor then bore the stretcher to
Sally's hut.
     "Dulcy," Sally said as she turned back to speak with the
dragon, "that landing was...."
     "Hey, I just hope your Ma's gonna be OK."
     "Thanks," she said quietly, then ran to catch up with the
others.
     Inside Sally's hut, lights were lit, the bed had been turned
down, and water was heating in a nearby fireplace.  The stretcher
was placed near the bed and Sally and Sandy began putting their
mother into the bed.  Bunnie and Rotor helped, but Bunnie's
attention was mainly on Sandy.
     "Oh mah stars, you ARE twins!"
     "Sandy," Sally began, "this is...."
     "We met," both Sandy and Bunnie managed to say in unison.
     "Rotor, could you tell everyone to keep their distance until
the Queen...until Mother has had a chance to rest?  I don't think
a lot of people crowding around will do her any good."
     "Sure, Sally.  And maybe I'd better tell...."
     Rotor was interrupted by the crashing sound of crockery
hitting the floor.  All eyes turned to the doorway.  There stood
Rosie, Sally's old nanny.  She looked at Queen Alicia with wide
eyes, then those eyes rolled upward and she went into a dead
faint.  Sally and Bunnie helped her up off the floor and seated
her in a nearby chair.
     "She looked like she'd seen a ghost!" Bunnie said.
     "She probably thought she did," Sandy added.  "Mother once
told me that only a handful of people in the palace knew that
twins had been born, and they'd all been sworn to secrecy."
     "Well, the secret was safe with Rosie. She never said
anything about my having a twin sister."
     Just then, from outside the hut there was a sound like the
sound barrier being seriously tested.  A moment later, Sonic
entered the hut.
     Someone followed him inside, someone whose body shone with a
metallic gleam in the hut's candlelight.  This was Sonic's uncle,
Sir Charles Hedgehog, once one of the leading scientific minds of
Mobius.  He was also one of the first to have been roboticized,
and it was only by a perseverance that managed to awaken some
spark of his old self that Sonic had been able to free his Uncle
Chuck's mind from Robotnik's control.  Now Uncle Chuck, as
everyone in Knothole called him, used his roboticized form to his
advantage and lived the life of a spy in Robotropolis, keeping
the Knothole freedom fighters informed of developments.
     But Sandy had no knowledge of these things yet.  At the
first sight of Uncle Chuck, she immediately reached for her
knife.
     "No!" Sally said, "he's on our side."
     "First a dragon, now a robot.  You've made quite an
interesting assortment of friends!"
     As for Uncle Chuck, he stood in the doorway transfixed as he
recognized the figure in Sally's bed.  Then, without a word, he
crossed over to the side of the bed and dropped to one knee,
bowing his head.
     "I am at your service, my Queen," he said softly.  He raised
his head and looked into her face.  "I...I never thought I'd see
this day!"
     "My days...may be few," the Queen managed to whisper.
     "Don't talk like that, Mother!" Sally said.  "Uncle Chuck is
going to do everything he can to help."
     "And the most helpful thing we can do is to let the Queen
rest," Uncle Chuck added.  "Everyone except the princesses, go
back to bed; I want to talk to them.  And to Rosie, once she
wakes up."


     The residents of Knothole were up and about even earlier
than usual the next morning.  Mostly, though, they were clustered
near Sally's hut discussing the events of the night just ended. 
In obedience to Uncle Chuck's order, the freedom fighters stayed
outside the hut.  However, as a spontaneous gesture, they began
leaving flowers, fruit, personal items and other objects near the
door and on the porch.  It was clear that their loyalty to the
Queen had not dimmed.
     Inside, Uncle Chuck had spoken with Sandy, trying to learn
all she knew about how she and her mother had come to be
partially roboticized.  He studied both the Queen and Sandy for
some time.
     "This is an older design," he told Sally and Sandy, "not
like the one Robotnik is using now.  He must have used a
prototype of the roboticizer on you and your mother, Sandy."
     "Somehow," Sandy added bitterly, "I don't appreciate the
fact that we were test subjects."
     As for Rosie, she almost went into hysterics when she came
to.  Uncle Chuck was able to calm her, so that she could tell her
own story:
     "I've not seen the two princesses together since I helped
bring them both into the world.  And no sooner had I done so that
this official-looking swine in a uniform walks into the room. 
There were two police robots with him, there were, and what he
says were orders from the King.  He says the Queen and the
second-born daughter were to be moved that night to the capitol
of the Southern Provinces, while the first-born was to stay with
the King in Mobotropolis.  'Security concerns,' he says!  I
didn't believe him for a second, but the King said to let them
go.  Then he swears me to secrecy not to say that two babies were
born that night.  I didn't understand why, but I obeyed my King,
I did!"
     "And that's why you fainted when you saw Mother and Sandy?"
Sally asked.
     "No, I...well, it was the last I'd heard of them until we
received reports that the Southern capitol had been bombed in the
Great War.  The reports all spoke of there being no survivors
so...."
     "So you thought we'd been killed," Sandy said.  "And we
almost were, too."
     "If only it hadn't been for that war...." Sally added.
     "I've got news for you, Sally.  The Great War ended two
years after we were born."
     The Knothole dwellers looked at Sandy, stunned.
     "Mother and I weren't able to learn that until later, when
we'd talk with other refugees we met on the caravans: the other
side had sued for peace repeatedly.  Those reports were never
carried back to Mobotropolis, which continued sending military
bots to the staging area in the south.  From there, they were
being dispatched to conquer neutral territories all over Mobius. 
Only when they were all under martial law and under the control
of the bots did War Minister Julian move against
Mobotropolis...."
     "...calling himself Ivo Robotnik," Sally said.  "I can see
it all now; why couldn't we have seen it coming?"
     "Well," Uncle Chuck said softly, "never mind the past. 
We've got work to do."
     Using a diagnostic program resident in Nicole, he was able
to take readings on Queen Alicia's roboticized parts as well as
her internal organs and systems.  He also had Rosie gather
together a great number of bowls to be sterilized by placing them
in boiling water.
     "Why?" Sally asked.
     "I'm going to need blood samples.  I'm also going to need
paper."
     Uncle Chuck examined a number of Sally's books, found
several with suitable paper, then enlisted Tails to carefully cut
along the margins with a pair of scissors to make paper strips.
     Then it was time to take blood samples.  Sonic, Sally, Rotor
and Bunnie were more than willing to help, even though it meant
nothing so taxing as each of them placing about a dozen drops of
their blood in a bowl.  Antoine was more reluctant, but his
initial reluctance melted as he saw the first few drops of
Bunnie's sample dripping into a bowl, and he promptly fainted. 
Uncle Chuck found it much easier to get the sample from the
unconscious fox.
     "This is a good look for Ant," was Sonic's observation. 
Finally, the samples were ready and labelled.
     "I don't suppose you have any of the Queen's medical records
on file," Uncle Chuck asked Sally.
     "I don't know.  Nicole has access to the royal archives but
there's some kind of a security block on them."
     "Level 7?"
     "How did you know!?"
     "Don't worry about it, Sally.  I'm going to need some of
that paper now, Tails."
     Cutting a small strip from the paper, Uncle Chuck dipped one
end of it into the sample of Sally's blood.
     "Nicole," Uncle Chuck ordered, "access royal archives."
     "ROYAL ARCHIVES ONLINE."
     "Sally, is there a small opening near the top of Nicole's
casing?"
     "Yes; I've wondered what that was."
     "If I'm right, it's a biosample access port.  Would you open
it, please?"
     Sally did so, and Uncle Chuck slid the bloodied paper strip
into it.  A few seconds later:
     "GENETIC PATTERN CONFIRMED.  LEVEL 7 SECURITY BLOCK HAS BEEN
REMOVED."
     "So THAT'S why I could never get anywhere trying to crack a
level 7 block!" Rotor said.  "It's not based on alphanumerics at
all."
     "That's right, Rotor.  A level 7 is based on genetic
sequence pattern recognition.  I didn't know whose pattern was
used, the King's or the Queen's, but I guessed that Sally's
blood would have enough of either of her parents to match.  Now,
I've got tests to run.  Sally, may I have use of Nicole?"
     "Of course, Uncle Chuck.  Sandy and I have...business...to
take care of."

As your basic nerd engineer, I can't help but wonder how much of this is 
because he's attracted to _her_, and how much is because of his technical

I noticed that too...

But another CD scene that bothered me was the vending machine Sonic would 
visit now and then - huh?  Why would something like that still be working?

Errr, CD scene?  Color me confused, but the only meaning I can assign to 
this is the game "Sonic CD", and the closest thing that has to a vending 
machine is a hidden statue in one of the levels (details via private 
email) that spits out rings...

> Is this YARFTVG?  (Yet Another Relic from the Video Game)

No, the games don't have any vending machines.  A few slot machines, 
though.  And giant pinball games.  And monitors with special powers 
inside.  And Purina Island...  (:3

Ron,

The excerpts look interesting...too bad I haven't seen the story itself!
If it doesn't show up on the system soon, I may have to go into beg mode
and ask you to repost.

Also, Wednesdays appear to be the day when the local system asks
whether we want to subscribe to new usenet groups.  So I'll know by
tomorrow if they got the word on alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog -- no sign of
THAT to date, either!

Hi y'all!

I found a new address with some Sonic pictures in it.  Try this
out:
http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk:80/Games/console/sega/

Warning:  This address (at least from my location) takes a long
time to connect to and download pictures from.  Be sure you have
something else to do with your time while waiting (like a good 
book).

Sorry; actually, I had to think for a couple of minutes what I meant too :^)
CD = chili dog.

And while I'm at it, Spyhog had Uncle Chuck shedding tears at the end, and 
another show (or the same one?) had Sonic bringing him a chili dog which he 
ate, enjoyed, and burped up - huh?  Neither of these should have been 
possible in his robotic form although the tear scene was touching...

So where did the chili dogs come from then?

Because they're not fully robots- There is still sufficiant remains of 
their biological forms to accomplish things... (It's more a means of 
slavery than anything else, since Robotnik could've just as easily had 
robots *manufactured*, instead of roboticising everyone...)

What, it seems implausible to you that a certain type of food would last 
out 1500 years? ;) Better forget your lox & bagels tonight... ;) Heck, 
the *pizza* has been around for nearly 1000 years, but only in the last 
200 years in the forms we know it today.... Most Mexican dishes can be 
traced back to pre-aztec times, *at least* 1500 years...

So why *not* chili dogs....? ;)

....Quozl!

More importantly than that, can you ask them why the show was _really_ 
cancelled, and if there's any chance somebody else might pick it up?

It'll probably get worse now that a.f.sh exists - did we ever come to a 
consensus about the fate of the list?

I used to think that too, but I just spent 2 hours going through my "later" 
folder of 280 messages - I managed to get it down to 250...

So, has anybody stopped by a.b.p.e.c. newsgroups lately?

The artist of cc-sonic.gif and cc-tails.gif has yet another pic to show us!

It's called cc-sonic2.gif and it features Sonic and Tails again.  This 
time however . . . well . . .you'll have to see it.

I'll be posting it to my Web site tomarrow, so if you want to see it, 
it's there.

If E-mail is all you have and you have a UUdecoder, ask me and I'll send 
it to you.

I thought Uncle Chuck WAS fully robotocized.
Of course, this could open up a new thread as to how the robots go about
repleneshing their energy supplies.  Drawing a similarity here, Data on
ST:TNG has the ability to eat, and, depending on what books you read and
which episodes you watch, he can even glean certain nutrients from the food
that help his android components.

And so, we come back to my favorite debate :-).  Exactly where and what
is Mobius.

Like several people (including myself) have argued, the date references should
not be used to support Mobius being a future Earth.  For one thing, it
would be impossible for one species of animal, let alone the multitude we see
on Mobius, to evolve into sentient, self-aware creatures in less than 2000
years.  Now, it is possible that this is actually an Earth set several
million years in the future, after humans have blown themselves into
oblivion and the Earth started over with other animals (after all, doesn't
the sun have about 5 billion years of life left?), which use a date system
based on an event other than Christ's birth (the Second Coming, perhaps? 
well...let's not get into Mobian religion just yet :-)...)  But then how
would one go about explaining the many things that just happened to appear
once again?  Chili dogs?  France?  The English and French languages?  And
what about the magic of Mobius, such as the Time Stones or 'The Void'? 
Also hard to explain in a future Earth.

I still say that Mobius exists in a universe parallel in many ways to our
own, and that Mobius is the Earth of that universe.  I'm currently working
on a whole background to support this and expand on it, which I will use
in some stories that I plan to write.  Of course, all this will take place
when I finally get to see the cartoon series myself.  (Thanx once again,
David, and continued curses against Channel 2 and ABC in general.)

Did you know that not only a 'Dumb & Dumber' cartoon, but a 'Ace Ventura'
and 'The Mask' cartoon are also planned for next season?  <<GROAN>>

Well, after the initial brainspurt, the volume of posts is expected to go 
down...  (:3

I'm fond of the Happy Fun Fox too, but he's tragically underutilized as a 
Freedom Fighter; of the characters who've made their presence known on 
the show, I'd say my favorite is Bunnie Rabbot, with Sonic himself a 
close second.  Bunnie just has so much character potential, and is cute 
as the dickens to boot...  (;3

   I've always had this bad feeling about time travel.  It's either possible
or impossible.  If it was possible, wouldn't people be coming back into time
and visiting us?  Eventually, time machines will be sold in 7-11s like
batteries and anybody could use one.  By that time, all the psycos would've
gone back in time and screwed the human race to extinction.  There is only
one scenario that I can think of were time travel is possible: the government
became so powerful that it can monitor every move we make.  This way, nobody
can use their time machines other than their most trusted politicians.

I'm still here, if you need someone to type to.  I've been keeping a vigil on
a.f.s-h and this net, so I'm not dropping off until I have to go to summer
school.  And my Spring Break is next week, so I might (or might not) be 
flooded with mail.  Take off for just a few days....

That's exactly why.  Ever noticed how their abilities complement each
other?  The groundbound fox (but good flyer) plus the flying-innate
(but horrible on landing) would make these two together a great team.

Princess Sally.  If there where the Cartoon equivalent of the
Emmys/Logies, I'd vote her for "Best Female" in any cartoon...
(I'll puke if I see one more all-American debutant. :/  Bunnie
would get my nomination of 'most deserving of more character
development and exposure' though. :)

I'd like to place a vote for my favorite Freedom Fighter...

Who other than Sonic himself!?

Besides, I'm paid to say that anyway...  :)

(In all honesty, I am probably more partial to Tails, but don't tell 
anyone.)


Hmmm... I don't know why the Saturday series was cancelled.  As I mentioned 
before, we're pretty much out of the loop when it comes to non-game related 
things.  Perhaps you folks should do the letter writing thing to the show's 
producers in an effort to save it?

I find it tough to say who my favorite freedom fighter is but when I really
get down to it I'd have to give a vote for the title character himself

  Sonic the Hedgehog!

This is odd because I usually root for the annoying sidekick :)  I guess
Tails isn't annoying enough.  Don't get me wrong.  I found it a real toss-up
between Sonic, Tails, Sally, and Rotor.  They're all great characters (well
they screwed up Rotor in the 2nd season).

For me, Bunnie and Dulcy lose because of their voices.   I've never been a 
big fan of the 'Southern Belle' accent and Dulcy's voice is just too high
and squeaky.  Antoine could use some character development (or just some 
improvement... he's just TOO bumbling)  His high point this season was when
Snivley tortured him by screwing up crepes and escargot (sp? I could never 
spell those French things)).

     One thing to keep in mind while considering what
Uncle Chuck is capable of is that the Roboticizer
creates a very close analogue of the original body.
Down to coloration, sometimes.  I'm not sure about the
burp, but it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest that
Chuck's body is capable of producing tears, or has
somewhere to store 'food' after it's been consumed.  I
doubt it could be digested, or even tasted, although
he would probably enjoy it for psychological reasons.

Many mailing lists, newsgroups, Compu$erve forums, Fido echo's, etc. have 
a few people who post often, many who post every now and then, and a 
large number who (for whatever reason) never post.  It's really normal

It had taken me a while to decide, but Tails is my favorite too.  It might
have been Sonic himself, but the "Drood Henge" episode was mostly
responsible for Tails becoming my favorite.  Rotor is the first one I got
to like.  And as long as you called this a poll, don't forget to compile
results and post a summary (g).

Cmdr. Data isn't the only one.  In the movie "Not Quite Human", the boy

Our sun does have several billion years left.  But if Mobius is not a 
future earth, it can't be in our solar system.  No other planet in our 
planet can support such living things.  I did once before post that 
Mobius could be using a different date system; some cultures on Earth do 
too.  But we don't know what event was designated as Year 0 or 1 (where 
did they begin numbering?).  As for religion on Mobius, I've seen no 
clear indication what, if any, religion(s) is/are practiced there.  It is 
possible that they could develop chili dogs without any knowledge of 
Earth (but not necessarily exactly like ours), but duplication of the 
French language, culture, and planetary region is highly unlikely.  I 
would agree that the Time Stones and Deep Power Stones would be hard to 
explain for a future Earth.

Not necessarily another universe.  The explored area of our universe is 
already thought to be much smaller than the entirety of our universe.  
Data gathered from the "outer edges" is millions, even billions, of years 
old by the time it is received here, and we cannot predict what is in 
those places right now.  The laws of physics might be different in other 
parts of the universe.  Not different in a random way, but different in 
some scientifically explainable way if only we had the needed 
information.

As far as the Mobian history I favor an Earth-*related* background, but
don't really think of it as Earth.  As Mouse (Richard) has pointed out,
there seems to be a clear distinction between 'native' (completely
unEarthlike) species, like the flying insects and birds; and humanoid
animals of familiar types.  Pet theory: genetic engeneering of animals
on Earth a few millenia ago, who (as we humans are wont to do) got sent
out on all the early space missions- thus they're MUCH more widely
spread than the humans are.

There's two possibilities for the parallels in this case.  One, they're
fine- everything got imported however long ago from Earth, albeit sometimes
in corrupted forms.  This would require a more recent exodus from earth, 
no more than one or two generations, I think, otherwise the accents
(for example) would no longer be at all recognizeable.

Option 2: we're seeing the adventures 'filtered'- ie, everything that
happens is actually very, very alien, butthe storyteller is replacing
elements with ones familiar to us.  For example, Antoine does not
speak with a french accent, but he comes from a culture with a strong
tradition of history and cuisine, and is somewhat effeminate, fitting
our American stereotypes of the French, so french is used.  Sonic
doesn't like chili dogs, but some hideously unhealthy food made of
undefined meat byproducts; etc, etc.  This lets you put Mobius pretty
much whenever and wherever you want, and doesn't require a connection
to Earth *at all*, but then you'd be forced to assume *nothing* is
as its shown on the show.  Sonic isn't a hedgehog, but a purple screecher.

I think I prefer option one...

Hmm... who's our favorite freedom fighters?
 
<smirk>  It should be obvious!  :)  SONIC RULES!!  :)
But I digress, buds, I DO hafta admit I think Tails HASTA tie
in this 'favorite' catagory for me.  He's a little guy, but
he's real kewl and maybe better in some ways (he can fly 'n
all...even if he's not QUITE as fast as Sonic).
 
As for our favorite female freedom fighters... yeah!  Sal takes
the cake for sure!
 
I figured I'd throw in my own teo rings.  :)

"Most trusted politicians" - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
That is the BEST oxymoron I've heard in a LONG time....

About time travel:
As far as Modern Physics may dictate our understanding of time travel, it
would be impossible (remember Sally: "time travel violates all the laws of 
physics")
However, it is possible to slow time down using Einstein's theory of 
relativity...
Consider a mother of age 25, with a daughter age 2.  If the mother goes into 
space (in a rocket) & travels at 99% of the speed of light for 30 years, 
when she returns
to Earth, she will have aged 4 years, while her daughter will have aged 30!
The mother is 3 yrs.  younger than her daughter!
(I didn't bother to put the equations in...they are tedious & boring - if 
you don't believe me, send me an E-mail and I'll send 'em to ya :) )

That is the closest thing there is to "time travel" in our universe (as we 
understand it today) , but since there is still  so much unexplained 
evidence of what we don't know, one may not rule out the possibility...

This is the reason why "magic"  portrayed in Sonic could in fact be 
real...it isn't really "magic", it is just not understood by the amazed 
spectators...

Another example:  immagine a scientist traveling back in time to the dark 
ages...
let's say he/she demonstrated the use of a magnet to the people of that 
time.  What would the likely result be?   Simple - a mob of people screaming 
"WITCH" & crying out to kill the "magican" who was obviously a servent of 
Lucifer.  We today can't fully relate to how those people might have felt to 
see such a "strange" occurrence. -
but we CAN relate to what the future will eventually bring- more "magic"

You might also remember that one of the 1st season shows  had a magician who 
took Sonic's speed away   - By using the electronic belt he was wearing! 

Remember:magic is only an illusion - and usually only the magician knows the 
 secret........

(I'm just trying to show that Mobius could in fact be a future Earth - I 
feel like the only one, though)

Sally all the way!  She has my vote also! 
(being a longtime drooling Sally fanboy just MIGHT be influencing my decision,
though  ;)~~~       )

Is it just me, or does anyone else find it ironic that no one has voted for 
SONIC yet?  (he IS the main character, after all)

Yup. Just another example why you can't rule out Mobius being Earth.
(another is on a message I just posted about time travel)
(and I have a message threed of about a dozen MORE reasons...but that's not

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS

Welcome to the only mailing list that's way past cool  -- Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In this mailing list, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@sard.mv.net.
There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read
them before posting to the list.  They can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as faq-dd and faq-jf.  See "How to
Retrieve Files" below.

This list is archived, and the archive can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as a file, just like the FAQ's.  The
filename to request is mail.txt.  There are a few other Sonic-
related files, mostly clips from the archive, that you can
retrieve too.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters
and stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  You may post messages on the Sonic games to
the extent that the focus is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or
characters, and not on the games themselves.  Asking why Knuckles
rarely appears in the comics is on-topic, but asking how to become
"Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.

If you feel you must flame someone (other than Robotnik (g) ), please
do so in mail directly to that person.  And as on most areas of the
'net, legally obscene material and posts of a commercial nature are not
welcome here.  

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

How To Retrieve Files
---------------------
To get a list of files you can retrieve, send this text to
majordomo@sard.mv.net:
    index sonic
    end
Once you have the filename of the file(s) you want, retrieve them
by sending this text to majordomo@sard.mv.net:
    get sonic file1.txt
    get sonic file2.txt
    end
Use one "get" line for each file you want.


Many thanks to Ratman (Paul Hurley) for giving us a virtual Knothole.

FTP SITE
--------
There is a ftp site to go along with this list.  Just ftp to
ftp.mv.com and go to /pub/users/rat/sonic.  Upload files to
/pub/users/rat/incoming.  Sounds and images are welcome.  Older
list archive files can be found here (in compressed form) too.

Sonic himself did get a few "split" votes for favorite.  He almost became 
my favorite.  As for the females, Sally is my favorite.  I do like 
Bunnie, but her rabbitality ("personality" doesn't seem appropos) just 
isn't quite right for her to be my favorite.  One thing I wonder about, 
though.  Should Nicole be considered "just" a computer, or counted as 
another Freedom Fighter?  Nicole's intro in the Archie comics made her 
more of a character than she's been in the cartoons.

Er - Jeff, as far as I can tell, though I'm not keeping
count, Sonic's got like half the votes.  Or only
slightly less than Tails, at least.  Seems odd, really.
Tails I can understand, but I really have no idea what
anbody could see in Sonic.
     As for Ronnie's overview, I personally agree with
it except for one thing - the accents could actually
last quite some time, or even be recreated.  After 500
years it becomes rather unlikely, but far from
impossible.  And the colonists would have to have been
there for a while, at least, because Nicole refers to
the Wolf Pack's culture as 'ancient'.  Of course, she
might be referring to their derivations back on
earth... but most likely, they were simply one of the
first cultures built up by the colonists, and have
retained their integrity.  Which as I've said before
makes me wonder if the Great War wasn't against Earth.
Besides, the tall vs. dwarf trait in the populations
seems to be a simple mendelian trait, (implying that
Sally's mother was dwarf, but not requiring it).  For
this to be true of ALL these species, which it seems to
be (and even the humans!  Robotnik is tall, and Snively
is dwarf.) would almost certainly require that they be
genetically engineered.  Ditto interbreeding of any
sort.

Ich bin ein Mobian!

...or something like that.  Anyway, thought I'd clear up a few points:

I was asked by Ron Bauerle, now that I have introduced the character of
Sally's mother in "Bloodlines," as to the mother's species.  I haven't
found a neat way to work it into the narrative without making it sound
like I shoehorned it in.  Still, I DO have 8 more chapters to go.
Anyway, I belong to the "Sally Takes After Her Mother" school of thought
so (IMHO) Queen Alicia was, like her daughter, a ground squirrel.

Yet that raised another question for me: how would a Mobian answer the
question?  Do they see themselves as distinct species, or are what we
call "species" to them merely what we'd call "races"?  If you asked a
Mobian "What are you?" you might be more likely to hear "Mobian" than "A
rabbit/fox/whatever."  It would go a long way toward explaining what
we'd label interspecies mating (cf. the finale of "Sally's Quest" from
_In Your Face_ #1).

Robotics: I'll be giving a more detailed explanation in the course of
Bloodlines, Chapter 6, but it would appear that there is organic life
under there.  I have trouble with the notion of a being becoming totally
mechanized; seems to me that at least some of the organs and systems
would be intact but "exploited" by the mechanics in a host-parasite
relationship.  It would help explain, for instance, how Uncle Chuck
could have retained his old personality.

Favorite characters: depends on my mood.  Sally has to get the nod
simply because she's the classiest one of the bunch, at least as far as
the animated show was concerned.  It may be too early to notice, but in
my heart of hearts I have high hopes for Rosie becoming a fave if the
comics writers continue on.  I've always felt that Knothole needed an
*eminence grise* to keep the young whippersnappers in line ;-) , and
Rosie could fill that role nicely.  

Later today I'll try to sweet-talk the computer center into installing
NETSCAPE on my machine; then maybe I can find out what all the fanart
fuss has been about.

    Well, for me it's a tie between Bunnie Rabbot (Ah-Whoooo!) and the
often put-upon but culturally superior Antoine.  Yes, I said Antoine.  I
have to respect him for various reasone--
    1.  He is not physically courageous, but still he always tries.
    2.  He is the logest suffering member of the team.
    3.  He knows how to cook.  With style.  (I suspect that if he meets
with Snively again, he'll likely go for the needle-nosed litle twit's
throat with z5^e

Well.. Either everyone's too busy talking about theories of time travel
and who their best character is to notice.. but the next installment of
the Princess Sally Miniseries "Deadliest of the Species" is in. 
(At least I got it at my local comic shop yesterday)

For those interested we seem to have the same bunch...

Quick Recap of Part I

Here we meet Sally and the 'Freedom Fighters: The Next Generation' (FF:TNG).
( Hamlin [pig], Penelope [platypus], Arlo [armadillo], Dylan [porcupine?] )
Sally meets 'Former Secret Agent Geoffery St. John' [skunk]' while trying
to destroy the first of three energy substations needed to cripple
Robotnik's defensive Net.  St. John joins the group and he helps take out
the 2nd substation.  The FF:TNG don't like his additude though (especially
Hamlin).  Sally trusts St. John and belives in his ability to help the group.

At the end of Part I however... we see St. John wander off while everyone
is asleep...  'teleport' to a laboratory somewhere, and look what appears 
to be a duplicate of Sally in a chamber.

---------------
Now for Part II

We open with Hamlin and Geoffery in another spat.  Sally breaks it up and
tells Geoffery that they've gotta work together as a team instead of fighting
against each other.  Afterwards they prepare to take on the third substation.

Its inside an atoll* so they hang-glide their way in.  On their approach
Arlo's glider is shot and he crashes in the trees.  After landing, they 
find Arlo on the ground with a broken leg.  Penelope stays with him as the 
others go to the substation.

( * An atoll is a ringlike island that encloses a lagoon )
      -- Webster & the Miniseries Editors.

They get in easily but as they're setting up explosives, Sally is caught
by one of Robotnik's Octo-Pods.  Hamlin and Dylan try to discract the 
octo-pod and also get caught.  Geoffery uses the distraction to plant an
explosive under the octo-pod.  Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are let go when
Sally sprays paint in the the octo-pod's eyes.  They all escape in the 
nick of time.

They return to where they left Arlo and Penelope and find them missing
(no sign of trouble and no tracks leading anywhere).  Sally figures if 
they left under their own will or not.. its a sign of trouble and should
get the others out of there.  Hours later, back at camp, Arlo and Penelope 
haven't returned.

Shortly before dawn, while the others are asleep, we see St John taking
Sally with her (she's asleep)..  teleporting to that lab as before.. and
placing Sally in a chamber identicle to the one we saw the 'other' Sally.
St. John contacts Central Command (Robotnik) and tells him of his success
in gaining the FF:TNG's trust and exchanging Sally.

The next morning we see Sally (the duplicate), Hamlin and Dylan ready to 
raid Robotropolis.. Hamlin wonders about St. John but Sally doesn't seem
worried about him....

Meanwhile... St. John is bringing Sally (in the chamber) to Robotnik.
Robotnik figures with the Sally-duplicate in place, the others are
sure to fall into his trap and after Sally's been Roboticized, the
rebellion will fall.  All part of the Master Plan of Ivo Robotnik!

---

Well.. this brings up some interesting questions:
  Which side is Geoffery St. John on?
  What happened to Arlo and Penelope?
  What's Robotnik's EVIL(tm) plan?

YES!!!  Someone else in this world besides me, believes in that!
I sum it up into one sentence . . .

"If you can imagine it, it probably exists."

Mobius exists, Sonic exists, it all exists.  That's it and thats all!

Primenet finally started carrying the Sonic newsgroup, so now I can post 
to it with everyone else!

I made my newsgroup debut tonight by posting "The Power of Love" which 
someone reccomended I post.  So, if you have the group and you missed the 
story, I just posted it.

Subject: The Doomsday Pods (and roboticisation)....

Date: Mon, 6 Mar 1995 02:46:07 -0800 (PST)

OK, feel free to pass this along to the Sonic list if you wish... It 
should explain more about how the Doomsday pods were manufactured, as 
well as how robotisation is accomplished....

As I've said before, nanites, or more accurately, applied nanobiotechnology.

In Sonic's time, nanobiotechnology is a relatively old concept, which I 
believe is responsible for life on Mobius vis a vis terraforming 
projects. (More on that another time...) However, Robotnik applied this 
technology to forge the Doomsday pods, by dipping a skeletal frame into a 
vat of hot biometal (an organicly-created metal) that also contained the 
necessary nanite robots to forge and "grow" the components of the pods, 
even programming them. The technique applied is rather crude, but 
efficient for the job.

Uncle Chuck's roboticiser is a far more advanced version of this, using 
applied transporter-type technology to rapidly transport nanites and the 
biometals in and out of the recipient's body, facilitating the least 
amount of biological damage, and retaining compatibility with the 
recipient. I suspect the usage was to allow individuals with lost or 
useless limbs a much fuller life.

....Quozl!

USIT already picked up a.f.s-h, even before I asked for them to do so.  
Maybe after getting them to pick up rec.music.hip-hop, they just didn't 
want me calling them again (g).  So far -- and no surprise -- Delphi has 
not picked up the group, nor do I really expect they will.

Not everyone here will be posting.  I know one subscriber doesn't get 
alt.* groups and another subscriber isn't getting the group (not yet anyway).

     Guys, not meaning to be too harsh, but I've heard
a lot of theories on this list and most of them could
use a serious helping of Occam's Razor - which, to
those who aren't familiar with it, is a theory on
making theories that states that the simplest
explanation is most often true.  Or, to be a little
less simple but more accurate, that the least
fantastic explanation that still works is the best one.
Nanites I can actually deal with for the pit itself,
since that's about the only thing I can think of that
would explain why that pit works in the first place,
but you don't need to use any variation on normal
metals.  That's the only one I feel like pointing out,
but it's a serious problem when folks start theorizing
about things like this.

Since the story is already plotted out in my head, if not on screen, I
tend to think of the entire story as being in the past tense.

Besides, to quote good ol' #2: "That would be telling."

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  **The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  It states that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differs in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
features Geoffrey St. John, while another does not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  The
fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS Sega
reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series (as
reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to indicate
that someone had come down with a case of "creative differences."
In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began shipping the
week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.

The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics

In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a

Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls

disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool

Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
COMING SOON

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

Hello (to the Sonic Net in general):

I'll be off to my Mom's home starting tomorrow (Sat. as of
1045).  I'll return a week from then in the late afternoon, so
if the load on the local server here at UT isn't too high, I'll
log in.  I expect to see at least 150 messages to download
(ha ha)!  Anyway, carry on without me, and have fun with 
"The Temporal Syndrome":  Part 3.  That will be uploaded
within the next few hours (a few more things I need to work
on), and the entire story will be uploaded to Rotor (David) for
him to add it for downloading from his web page.

Hi y'all all over the Sonic Net!

My story "The Temporal Syndrome":  Part 3 is now complete.  The upload
procedue is similar to what I did for Part 2, so it's going to be a bit 
fragmented.
If you want the story in its ENTIRE unaltered format, I'm uploading the complete
copy to Rotor (David), for use in his personal page.  Check there later for the 
small novel (!) I have created.  This is going to be a big one, so expect 
the down-
loading to take some time.

	From the point of view of the two Knothole Freedom Fighters,
the temporal displacement effects were unpleasant and moderately
painful.  It was as if the temporal transport beam was stripping
them apart, atom by atom.  They felt their DNA split into its
component strands and recombine a billion times per second, as
though their DNA was struggling with great difficulty to
maintain contact with the current time period.  The very essence
of their bodies valiantly attempting to combat the effects of
the beam, but the beam eventually became the victor.  After the
transport initialization phase was complete, Sonic and Sally
felt themselves literally thrown into an unknown future time.
There was a flash of intense red light, and then the two found
themselves lost in the Great Unknown, but this place was far
more alien to them than the Great Unknown of their time.  It was
the Great Unknown of the distant future.

* * *

	In the present, Robotnik was thoroughly enjoying his latest
victory over his worst adversaries.  After eleven years of
contending with a teenage hedgehog and his friends, and losing
in the process, this event was one to be celebrated.  Now that
the foundation of the Knothole Freedom Fighters had been razed
from existence (at least in this time period), the rest the
infrastructure should fall eventually.  With the fall of the
Knothole Freedom Fighter front, Mobius would be in his hands, to
have and control.
	"Yes!" Robotnik exclaimed with excitement and accomplishment.
"Now, to celebrate."  An evil chuckle from Robotnik came forth,
lasting for about two minutes.  When he managed to regain his
composure, he turned to face Packbell and said, "Very good shot,
Packbell.  If you weren't already at your position in the chain
of command, I would promote you.  However, since I cannot do so,
I will merely congratulate you."
	Thank you, Doctor Robotnik," Packbell responded, also gratified
to see Sonic and Sally vanish from the current timeline,
although appended with a more insidious motive.  He had been
waiting for the perfect time to terminate Robotnik's reign to
begin his own, and the "death" of the hedgehog seemed to be the
most auspicious opportunity to do so.  Yes, Robotnik might be
somewhat more readily caught off guard this time.  In fact....
	An unusual sight caught Packbell's eye.  He hurriedly directed
his sensors over the control panel of the temporal displacement
device.  There was a graphical bar that steadily lengthened
toward an area shaded in red.  Although Packbell couldn't even
begin to translate the Cassandran language and understand the
control labels, a feeling of dread increased within him in
synchronization with the bar.  What he saw, he instinctively
didn't believe was productive to his future survival.  As if the
machine wished to acknowledge that hypothesis, an audio signal
steadily increased in volume in coordination with the
lengthening bar.  It was unnoticeable at first, then it became
apparent to both Packbell and Robotnik.
	After Robotnik first became aware of the unusual noise, he
stepped over to the control panel.  Observing that Packbell was
shocked with fear, or otherwise in a positronic-lockup due to a
problem he couldn't resolve, Robotnik looked over the control
panel to obtain an understanding of what would strike such an
unsettling response in Packbell.  He noticed that a graphical
bar was stretching uncomfortably close to a shaded red area.
Robotnik froze in place, for he knew in the back of his mind
what was happening, and felt foolish for assuming that the power
cells in the device would be stable enough to safely retain
their charge without facing the risk of an unrecoverable power
feedback loop.  The last thing Robotnik saw was a flash of
lethal radiation, and then nothing more.
	Just as on Cassandra, the fate of Mobius depended on the fate
of an ultimate weapon.  The difference in the comparison was
that the weapon itself would be responsible for destroying the
planet that its lifeforms knew and loved.  In its own sort of
way, the weapon seemed to wish to atone for the crime of its
survival, so its only solution was to destroy itself.  The
morals of its use made no difference;  preventing any further
utilization was all that mattered.
	There was no place on Mobius for anyone or anything to avoid
the global carnage that would reform the planet just as the
format command reinitializes a hard drive.  An explosion
occurred at ground zero of the probe's crash site, ejecting
gigatons of dust into the atmosphere.  The explosion was also
powerful enough to create resonance in the crust and mantle
throughout the planet.  Shockwaves transmitted through the
mantle caused the crust to restructure into waves, and finally
into fragments of mixed granodiorite/basalt material when the
stress was too great for the crust to withstand.  Continents and
oceans alike steamed with fury in the catastrophe.  The
fragments and dust slowly sank into the exposed mantle, leaving
nothing to go to waste.  In a matter of minutes, the planet that
was Mobius to its inhabitants became a hot radioactive sphere of
undifferentiated molten rock.  The new world had an opportunity
to become a biological storehouse, but at the cost of losing
everything its predecessor had.  It would be a long wait before
the genesis of new life would occur in the body of a very simple
and unassuming lifeform, and much longer before two certain
displaced lifeforms from the previous world would appear.

* * *

Dawn of an new eon...

	The reformation of the planet was remarkably similar to
Earth's, with differences in the formation of the key elements
as far as time was concerned.  Asteroids fell into the magma
ocean, though not the swarms that existed in Mobius' initial
formation about 4.6 billion years ago.  With the decreased
introduction of new material into the planet's microcosm, the
global magma ocean cooled considerably faster at the surface
than it had the first time.  In about 100 million years, the
first piece of basaltic crust formed and remained floating on
the magma.  Having a base to expand on, more basalt formed and
cooled until the planet was covered with a primordial basaltic
crust.  Occasionally breaks formed in the crust, caused either
by limited input from asteroids or differential stress in the
mantle.  From these fractured areas came the vapors that would
form the first reducing atmosphere.
	For about 300 million years, the atmosphere remained relatively
stable.  That was until the introduced water content became high
enough to permanently change all that.  Storms of lightning
emerged, and with storms came torrential rains to cool the crust
and form a global ocean.  The ocean remained dominant for about
a few million years, but the crust was not content to remain
under the ocean's rule.  Continents started forming, encroaching
on the ocean's territory.
	At about this time in the history of the new world, the basic
building blocks of life started forming in the ocean and pools
of water found on the infant continents.  These amino acids
eventually began forming chains, and these chains found others
of their kind to combine with.  Nearly two billion years after
the global catastrophe that Robotnik had caused, life had
reinstated its hold on Mobius.  One progression followed
another, and the series continued until many forms of diverse
life literally exploded into existence (similar to the event
that took place at the Precambrian/Cambrian time boundary).
	For about 200 million years, life remained in its birthplace,
the ocean.  Due to reasons unknown, some simple forms of plant
life began to see the logic of exploiting the virgin environment
of the upper world, so they made the first advancement toward
the open spaces of exposed igneous and sedimentary rock.  The
rogue plant life didn't survive for very long out of the water,
but life evolved, and soon (in geologic terms) plants extended
complicated root systems into the remains of their pioneering
ancestors. It is at this point where Sonic and Sally reappeared
in Mobius' geologic time record.

The present future...

	Their time travel was completed in a matter of seconds relative
to them, yet Sonic and Sally's journey spanned an
incomprehensible span of time in realspace.  The Mobius they
knew was an ancient, dead world without any sign in the new
world that its predecessor had ever existed.  They were aliens,
potentially pieces of future evolution on the new world (or not
if life would eventually evolve differently this time around).
In any case, they didn't belong in this time period.
	The pair were cast out from the temporal displacement
singularity, as if it were a predator that didn't like the taste
of its quarry after the kill.  After a two meter drop, Sonic and
Sally lied on the ground, still paralyzed by the initialization
phase.  As their DNA returned to normal, they both gained more
interactive contact with their new environment.
	Sonic was the first to gradually regain consciousness.  He
found himself lying flat, with his frontal region in full
contact with a shallow carbonate mud pool.  Fortunately, his
head was on a more solid, but still relatively soft carbonate
mud mound.  If that were not the case, he would have drowned in
twenty centimeters of mud.  Not blind to the irony of the
situation, he briefly thought about how he could confront
Robotnik and all his robots, only to be forced into time travel
and nearly meet his demise in a pungent mud pool.  Not exactly
the main event of his life.
	Another thing that Sonic noticed was something all too familiar
about the mud itself.  Of course the color was sufficient enough
to tell the hedgehog otherwise, and the mud was full of calcium
carbonate material and not an intricate mixture of quicksand,
petroleum, and clay mud, but he could swear that it felt like
MegaMuck.  He tested his extremities to confirm this.  His
fingers didn't flex very well, and it was a battle just to
slightly bend his arms and legs.  All too familiar a reminder of
the old world.
	As he felt himself coming further out from the shocked state
induced by the time travel, Sonic noticed that there was
something warm and furry resting on the left side his back.
Rotating his head to the general direction of the contact area,
he saw Sally's head there.  Sonic breathed a sigh of relief.  He
wasn't the only one to explore the intricacies of their mutual
ironical situation.  He shook around a bit, gently, to wake
Sally.  She remained in a dazed state, not reacting to his
motion.
	The hedgehog decided to test another tactic. He rotated his
body so that his front would be in contact with Sally's head,
and positioned her head on his upper abdominal area.  This time,
he tried shaking her a little more forcefully and whispering
into her ear.
	"Sally, Sally, it's me.  Remember, your best bud, Sonic?" he
said softly, and waited for a few seconds.  The results were not
very encouraging.  She seemed like she was coming out of her
dream world, but she needed just a little more encouragement.
	'OK, Hedgehog.  What now?' Sonic thought to himself.  In
response, his brain produced a plan to give Sally the perfect
wake-up call.  He rose slowly, taking precautions not to let her
head become one with the mud pool.  He slowly pulled her over to
the mud mound, and carefully placed her head on it.  No further
response from that, but Sonic wasn't finished yet.  After he put
her head on the mud mound, he tried to locate Nicole.  After
about a minute of feeling around Sally's legs and feet, he found
Nicole still attached to one of her boots.  Picking Nicole off
her boot and out of the mud, Sonic observed the small computer's
condition.  She was, expectedly, drenched with the products of
broken shells and organic excretions of calcium carbonate, but
would she still work?  He tried brushing her off, but belatedly
realized that using his hands to remove the mud from Nicole was
about as useful as drying a wet floor with water.  The hedgehog
then decided to test which hypothesis was correct.
	"Yo, Nicole," he commanded to the small computer.  Nicole
trilled in response.
	THAT woke Sally up, and with an energetic efficiency.  A
powerful force swelled through her body, providing an intensity
similar to moving through air, as if the restrictive carbonate
mud didn't exist.  She leaped out of the mud as fast as she
could, and slowly paced over to Sonic like someone with murder
on her mind.  She stared into his eyes with an intense, and
borderline dangerous regard for his future welfare.  Which, in
this case, didn't hold much in favor for Sonic.  If Sonic had
the mind-set to see the humor in the situation, he would have
noticed that Sally looked as if she tried to get a little too
much mud out of her mud pack.  All the normally jovial hedgehog
could see now were Sally's eyes, vicious and full of primordial
anger.
	"What...are...you...doing...to...NICOLE?!" she demanded, like a
mother crocodile accosting an unfortunate predator intent on
feasting on her young.
	Sonic slowly backed off, his own eyes pleading for mercy.
"Whoa, Sal.  Chill a minute!" he ventured, his voice a little
slurred with the surprise that one of his closest friends would
ever attack him like this.  Suddenly regaining his generally
frolicsome mood, but only halfway, he said half-jokingly and
half-seriously, "Man, you redheads sure are cranky when you wake
up in the morning.  Definitely not cool, Sal."
	The last comment from Sonic tamed Sally's precarious mood.  She
stopped strutting toward him, and a smile gradually crept across
her face as she seemed to consider exactly what danger Sonic
could be to Nicole's electronics.  She sat down, looked at
herself and the hedgehog, noticing that they were both covered
up to the neck with mud.  She laughed hysterically at the sight
for about a minute, as she thought about how an oversized mud
pack and a hedgehog would look together.  Sonic was about as
anyone could get to that level of contact, and so was she.  The
hedgehog could only stare at her, unsettled by the response.  It
wasn't exactly the one he wanted, but it would have to do for
now.
	As if realizing the effect she had on her friend, Sally stopped
laughing, but her face softened to a considerate grin instead of
a more serious regard.  She stood up, and walked slowly over to
Sonic.  Anyone else would say that her strut, her facial
expression, and of course being covered in mud made her seem
like she was attempting to be seductive.  But Sonic knew Sally
better than that.  She enveloped him in a caressing embrace.
	"Sonic," she said softly while stroking his upper torso,
"didn't I tell you to be more careful when you try out those mud
packs?  What do you do with them anyway?"
	Not intent on spoiling the humor, Sonic was quick to respond.
"Sal," he said in a voice as soft as what Sally used, "even
hedgehogs need a little beauty work done every once in a while.
Besides, I think I got a hold of Dulcy's by mistake."
	"Yes, but don't you think it was time you-"  She stopped
herself, as if remembering something.  Her face hardened to a
serious and thoughtful one.
	Sonic, realizing what significance one particular word in her
sentence had, followed suit.  They both disengaged their embrace
simultaneously, and slowly descended.  They sat and stared at
each other, both thinking of the ramifications of their
situation.
	The hedgehog asked the obvious, but necessary, question.
"Sal," he queried, "where are we?"  Slightly off the mark.
	Sally corrected him.  "It's not a question of WHERE, Sonic.
It's more like WHEN.  From the looks of things, we could've been
transported forward or back in time."
	"How do we find out when, Sal?"
	She thought the matter over.  Then she remembered something
about one of the new sensors Bookshire had told her about.  She
relayed the data to Sonic.
	"If I'm not mistaken, Bookshire installed a temporal
displacement sensor in Nicole.  She might be able to tell us
where in time we are."  She added privately in her thoughts, 'I
hope.'
	Sonic handed Nicole over to Sally.  She retrieved her little
computer, and quickly analyzed the condition of its
functionality.  Aside from the test that Sonic had done, she
checked Nicole via her diagnostics programs.  The results were
favorable:  covered in mud, but otherwise capable of running
programs and displaying data via her screen or holographic
projector. Nicole had been constructed well, and was meant to be
more than an aesthetic ornament.  The aesthetics could wait, for
the two Freedom Fighters had more important concerns.
	"Nicole," Sally directed, "calculate the total time
differential between the time period right before the transport
phase and now."
	"Working," the computer responded, "connection has been
established with temporal singularity."  After a second of
processing pieces of complex data, Nicole resolved them into
understandable temporal dynamics graphs.  "Approximate time of
transport:  3.8 billion years delta-t positive relative to our
time period."
	After hearing about how long they have been lost in limbo
between the two time periods (relative to realspace), both
dropped their jaws with shock.  A million years was
incomprehensible enough, but the time that had spanned since the
fateful day of their temporal displacement defied every level of
understanding.  Many geologic events (major and minor) can
potentially take place in a decade, in some cases even a year.
3.8 billion years leaves many opportunities for anything to
happen.
	Of course, with this span of displacement in time travel,
everything that they once had was gone a long time ago and
decomposed to dust.  All the familiar sights, sounds, personal
relations, and other things that were generally taken for
granted no longer existed.  In this time period, they were the
aliens, and Nature generally had ways with dispatching of
organic components that weren't part of the whole.  If they
stayed in this time period, there was a likelihood that they
wouldn't find the food they needed to survive, or shelter for
their exclusive use.  Staying here would be a death sentence;
returning to their time period was imperative.  That was
assuming that doing so was possible in the first place;  there
was no guarantee to the process even existing in the first place.
	Sally started crying when she finally considered the immensity
of their dilemma, and how everyone else wasn't present to keep
them company.  She thought of Tails, Bunny, Dulcy, Rotor,
Bookshire, Charles Hedgehog, and even Antoine.  The opportunity
to meet other Freedom Fighters was also out of the question.  It
was as if time was against them, and that statement was no
further from the truth than now.  Sonic noticed the unrest that
was present in his companion, so he went over to embrace her.
She said nothing, but she returned the embrace.  They both
understood what they were feeling, for they were both in the
same situation.  Both tried to think of ways to comfort the
other, but they also understood that words had no ultimate value
here.  They were alone for now, and nothing in the universe
could change that.
	Fighting back tears of his own, Sonic said to Sally in a gentle
voice, "Sal, how 'bout we go find someplace else to go?  I don't
really like the idea of sleeping in a mud pit."
	Sally struggled to speak, and succeeded.  "You're right," she
said, sniffling with extreme grief.  "Yes, it would be a good
idea to find shelter."  She added slightly jokingly, "Besides,
we already had our mud bath for the day."
	They both managed to find humor in that statement, and reacted
accordingly.  With a new immediate purpose to meet, they set
about finding an area that was somewhat more solid, not to
mention less offensive to the olfactory nerves.  Before they
began their trek for a provisional residence, Sally left a
remote multipurpose sensor/transponder, in order to monitor the
temporal singularity.  With a little help from Nicole, they
located solid ground about six km due north.  Given the fact
that the mud was about half as viscous as MegaMuck, Sonic had
some difficulty trying to get through, but he could manage.

	It was near dusk when they found a site that would serve as a
suitable shelter for the duration of their stay, however long it
would be.  It was a cavern located about fifty km inland from
the carbonate mud pit.  It had a few of the amenities of modern
life:  a bath (subterranean lake), water from the stream that
fed the lake, and beds (unusual calcium carbonate cave
formations that were actually soft enough to sleep on).  All
that remained was one problem:  food.  There was nothing
available besides the native plants, and they were officially
declared unfit for consumption by Nicole.  They did have ration
packs, but those were nearly completely consumed before the
incident in the canyon.  All they could do at this point is
conserve their energy.
	In the endeavor to keep them distracted from their gastronomic
requirements, Sonic and Sally took a bath to rinse the mud off,
and talked about anything in general for a while.  They also
reviewed the data regarding the temporal displacement device and
the other hardware in the probe.  Sonic tried to be as
accommodating as possible, trying not to interrupt when a new
piece of technobabble surfaced.  Sally appreciated this act
forwarded by the normally impatient and disinclined hedgehog.
In return, she tried putting in a little more explanation into
the more difficult concepts so that she and Sonic would
understand them.  Whether Sonic acted this way out of kindness
or for another motive wasn't clear.  What was clear was that
they were both in the same situation, and teamwork would be
their only savior.


	As time slowly progressed on for the two surviving Freedom
Fighters, they learned a great deal of information about the
temporal displacement device.  However, none of the data was
actually useful in the field combat sense.  More data had to be
searched through to find something they could utilize. That was
until an hour before midnight, when something caught Sally's eye.
	"Sonic," Sally said, "I think I've found something that might
get us back to our time period."
	The hedgehog replied patiently, "As I say to Bunny, 'I'm all
ears.'"
	Sally then continued with the description.  "According to this,
we can return to our own time period by applying an inverse
temporal entry vector utilizing the same level of power that was
used by the device to send us here."
	Sonic thought that statement over.  He stood up, apparently
tired of sitting while contemplating the issue.  "Let me get
this straight, Sal," he hazarded.  "If we go back through that
time hole with the same amount of juice that got us here, we get
back to our time?"
	"Exactly, Sonic," Sally confirmed.  "I'm already working on
calculating what power level the device used to bring us here."
To Nicole, she asked, "Nicole, what is the absolute time
differential from previous readings?"
	"Calculating, Sally," Nicole answered.  "Absolute temporal
displacement:  three billion, 800 million, 200 thousand, 906
years, two months, five days, ten hours, five minutes, thirty
seconds.  Readings based on prescaled data."
	The hedgehog wasn't exactly aware as to why that level of
accuracy was required.  He made his point audible.
	"In order to get back to our time," Sally explained, "we need
to know exactly when it was we were transported here.  If the
wrong level of power is given on the return trip, we may find
ourselves before or after the time we want to go back to."
	"How does power on the return relate to the power the time
machine used?" Sonic asked thoughtfully.
	"According to the data, the power response is linear.  That is,
the power differential relative to what the device used would
send us before or after the event took place."
	"So that means if I give it more juice than the device used, we
could go back in time to before we were sent here?"
	"Right," Sally said.  She was about to continue, but she
paused, thinking about what observation Sonic had made.
Slightly surprised by his proposal, she said, "Sonic, you want
to go back to the time before we were sent to this time period?"
	"Correctomundo, Sal," he confirmed.
	"But why?"  Sally was somewhat puzzled by the hedgehog's choice
of tactics.
	It was Sonic's turn to explain his rationale.  "Let me put it
this way, Sal," he began, pacing as he spoke, like a professor
teaching a class.  He amplified his voice, speaking to the
cavern at large, to give his statements an ominous sound to
them.  The cavern's acoustics provided the perfect response.
"There's still too much we don't know about that time machine
that even the info Nicole got can't tell us.  We don't know if
it was an experimental wartoy or otherwise, and billions of
other things that might affect how well it works.  Another is
that thing's old beyond belief.  We don't have a clue to how it
reacted after 'Buttnik fired it, and this hedgehog ain't willing
to bet on something being stable for that long."
	Sally thought the point over, and concluded that Sonic could be
right about the temporal displacement device.  Considering the
matter further, if they did go back in time to the right hour or
even minute, there might be enough of an opportunity to destroy
the machine before Robotnik had the chance to use it himself.
The key was to find the right time, and go back to it so that
they could perform the necessary destructive acts.  One thing
remained burning away in her mind, though.
	"There's just one thing though," Sally stated, "if we go back
in time to a point before we were sent here, we wouldn't exist
after a while."
	"Say what?!" exclaimed the confused hedgehog.
	"Sorry, Sonic.  I didn't mean that the way it sounded," she
apologized.  "What I meant was that WE, the you and I here,
would cease to exist at the time when Robotnik engaged that
device.  The 'other' us, the Sonic and Sally in sync with time
back in the past will live.  They, I mean we, just won't
remember what happened.  If we're successful this time around,
it would be to our other selves like the entire incident never
happened.  You and I would have destroyed the device, so the
other us would never be sent to the future.  Do you still want
to go back before Robotnik used it against us?"
	"It's a chance we'll have to take, Sal.  If we go back to when
Robotnik sent us here, we'd just end up in that beam again.  And
if we go after, that thing might blow up in our face."
	"You're right, Sonic," she finally said after scheming over the
proposed plan.  "Going back before Robotnik got his hands on it
and used it against us would be the best idea I heard all day."
	"Yo, Sal.  Remember this:  the Hedgehog is always right."  He
dictated this teasingly.
	Sally retorted in kind.  "Since when?"
	Sonic responded with a glare, but they both knew it to be
mocking only;  not a real threat.  Sally responded with her own
glare toward Sonic.  Mutually disarmed, they surrendered to
laughter and embraced each other for a while.
	Realizing that the technical discussion of time and space had
purged more energy out of them than expected, they went to
sleep.  The next morning would be the day of the great escape
from this future time period, in the hopes of creating a better
one in the past.

* * *

	The next morning, the two companions in time went back to the
temporal singularity for the final preparations on their return
trip.  Along the way, they discussed and decided when to return
to, and what power level was needed.  While walking through the
mud pool, they both tripped over rocks hidden under the opaque
layer of shell and other carbonate excretion products.  This
eventually covered them in mud from their head to their feet,
making the journey even more difficult since they were partially
blinded by the mud caked over their eyes.  But they managed to
trek on.  Within about two hours, they managed to arrive at the
temporal singularity site.
	"Where's it at, Sal?" Sonic inquired, quickly scanning for
their passage to home.  "I can't see it out there anywhere."
	Sally handed a pair of multispectrum goggles to him and
responded, "Here, try these on, Sonic.  I've modified them to
detect temporal distortions."
	Sonic retrieved the goggles, put them on his face, and searched
the area again.  "Got it," the hedgehog said to his comrade when
he located the singularity thirty meters ahead of them.  "Cool.
You got the juicing limit set, Sal?  That might've been the
mistake we made the last time we tried this," he said not
without some concern.
	Technically, Sonic was incorrect in his last statement.  From
the viewpoint of Mobius' past, this would be the first time that
they executed this plan.  However, now wasn't the time to argue
the finer points of temporal physics.
	"Yep, already done.  Twelve megawatts exactly," Sally verified.
"Just remember this," she admonished, "we need to go DIRECTLY
into the temporal singularity.  Otherwise..." she trailed off,
not inclined to think of the consequences.
	There wasn't any need for further discussion on this particular
subject.  It had been covered before.  They both knew that if
Sonic didn't enter the singularity perpendicular to its event
horizon, the best that could happen is that they could be
transported anywhere in time, without their discretion.  The
worst case, they could be trapped in the singularity for all
eternity.  No margin for error existed here, and everything
depended on Sonic's concentration and undeviating stability to a
path.
	With nothing further to review or to prepare for, they began
Phase 1:  powering for time transport.  Sonic reprogrammed the
goggles to display only the areas of the strongest temporal
displacement potential and added a target sight centerlined for
him, for that indicated the correct path to vector into.  Sally
got behind him, gripping his back with all the strength she had.
She pulled the power ring out of his backpack, and he assumed
his stance to engage the power transfer.  An energy field formed
around the hedgehog,  gradually becoming more powerful and
displacing the mud around his feet as he concentrated on
generating the required energy to travel over 3.8 billion years
into the past.  Nothing else existed in his mind;  only the
power ring field mattered now.
	Nicole was programmed to emit an audible signal when the
detected power field reached the preset energy level.  No
indication tone came from the little computer.  Sonic was
straining to his limit to generate the power field, but he
needed a little more encouragement.
	Sally noticed the hedgehog's predicament, and tried to motivate
him on further.  "Sonic, you can do it.  I know you can.
Concentrate harder."
	His only response was to strengthen the energy level in the
power field.  About five seconds later, Nicole gave the signal
they were waiting for.  He halted his energy demands from the
power ring, but maintained the power field surrounding him and
Sally.  Sonic then lowered his field of vision and centered his
target sight on the strongest area of temporal displacement.
After obtaining the desired target, he maintained his aim, and
fired.
	Phase 2 had begun.  Sonic covered the thirty meter distance to
the temporal singularity in a microsecond, his velocity warping
the volume of air around the energy field into an intense shock
wave cone.  Sonic entered the temporal singularity perfectly,
and remained on course back to the other opening in time and
space.  All that remained now was to traverse the
incomprehensible span of time back to the device and the person
responsible for their troubles.

Return from the future, to the present at 0800 hours...

	Robotnik and Packbell arrived at the crash site in Robotnik's
personal Hover Unit.  They had retrieved not only the
linguistics program, they also selected WorkerBots for a small
squad.  WorkerBots were much more adept at performing the
required delicate work on the probe and its cargo than the
SWATBots were constructed and programmed to exercise.  Packbell
personally took responsibility for dispatching the WorkerBots
and assigning them to their required duties.  Robotnik remained
in his command chair, watching them disperse to their positions.
 He reveled in the absolute beauty in the weapon, even though he
had no knowledge of what specific function it had.  He didn't
concern himself with what the weapon was utilized for, as long
as it would aid him in turning the tide of the war in his favor.
 Today could very well become a rather productive day after all.
	Without any provocation that was visible to Robotnik, an
explosion occurred somewhere outside to the west of his personal
Hover Unit.  It was very loud, and somewhat familiar, but he was
unable to identify who or what could generate that level of
thundering out of nowhere.  The answer struck him when the
windshield shattered about a second later from the massive wind
shear.  There was no other explanation;  it had to be a certain
blue spiny Freedom Fighter that Robotnik had learned to despise
and fear in the past eleven years.
	It was Sonic, and more specifically, the shock wave generated
by him that gave Robotnik the first and final warning.  After
departing from the temporal displacement singularity, Sonic
sustained his entry velocity, due to the fact that his inertia
was too high for him to decelerate immediately.  To allow
himself to do so, Sonic circled the probe's position at a radius
of three km.  Even from that distance, the hedgehog could view
the evidence that his warped air cone was wrecking havoc all
over the probe site.  Hover Units were under take-off condition,
and then spun around erratically during and after the wave
impacted with their hulls.  Some SWATBots were vacuumed into the
air, eventually bashing into other SWATBots or Hover Units.
Windows shattered, and electrical explosions emitted from
over-stressed hardware.  Fortunately, WorkerBots weren't present
in the metallic storm.  Decelerating to a sufficient pace, he
moved in for the fatal strike, like a Terran lion on the final
assault for disoriented prey.
	Sonic darted toward his general target area, and reached the
outer rim of Hover Units in about five seconds.  Sally had
managed to retain her life-grip on Sonic, using every bit of
energy she had available in her body to prevent her from
becoming an abandoned piece of debris in the hedgehog's warped
air cone.  Sonic located and halted in front of Robotnik's Hover
Unit.
	"Yo, Robuttnik," he said observantly, "nice looking windshield.
 Must be part of your latest stealth technology."  Looking past
the remains of the windshield, he said, "Ooohhh, mando cool look
on the insides.  Are fried control boards and circuits in?"  To
Sally, he ordered in a whisper, "You can get off now, Sal.
Hedgehog Express has stopped."  She released her grip and moved
to stand by him.
	Robotnik could only stare at the two Freedom Fighters with an
expression full of anger, bafflement, and fear simultaneously
displayed.  Observing their condition after a few seconds,
Robotnik regained a small degree of his own macabre humor at the
sight of something that looked like it was a costume for a mud
monster movie.  His evil grin came out of his shocked face, but
only a little.
	"Well, Hedgehog," he dictated in a voice that attempted to
sound authoritative and failed, "been playing in the mud have
you?  I thought that was below you;  I guess I was mistaken.
Where have you been?"
	The hedgehog retaliated with a confident strike, "Oh, just
tromping across a mud pit that doesn't exist yet."  He chuckled
at the thought, knowing that Robotnik would have no such memory
of the incident.  In the technicalities of temporal physics, it
had not occurred yet in this time period.
	Robotnik nearly resumed his multispectrum stare, but caught
himself before he became victim to his shock.  He sank into his
dark and devious regard that notoriously struck instant fear
into Freedom Fighters.  "Never mind that," his voice all gravel
and almost unnoticeable.  He amplified his voice, maintaining
the same tone, to say, "SWATBots!  Get that hedgehog!"
	All the remaining SWATBots came out of their stealthy positions
and moved toward Sonic and Sally.  Sonic quickly scanned the
immediate area, not exactly pleased with the odds.  Robotnik
transformed his dangerous frown into a lethal grin as the
SWATBots gradually decreased the distance to their quarry.
Sonic and Sally huddled, backs together, looking for an opening
in the circle of SWATBots.  They found no such escape route.
	"Doesn't look good, Sal," the hedgehog observed.
	"You're right about that.  Got any ideas?" Sally queried.
	He quickly searched his memory regarding how to handle the
situation.  He snapped his fingers, with what little snapping he
could do due to the mud on his fingers.  "As a matter of fact,"
he confirmed, "I do.  Hold tight, these 'bots are gonna be
hittin' the rocks."
	Within a second, Sonic created a twenty-meter high blue tornado
around Sally, providing refuge for her.  Everything outside the
eye of this storm however, was not so fortunate.  Sonic finished
off the rest of the SWATBots and Hover Units, turning them into
scrap metal and plastics, while leaving the probe and Robotnik's
Hover Unit undamaged.  Satisfied with his work, he revectered
himself in the opposite direction to quiet the whirlwind that he
formed.
	After returning to his position by Sally, Sonic directed an
evil grin at Robotnik and said, "Need any more convincing,
Robotnik?  Or do I need to really get serious?"
	Robotnik wasn't taking the hedgehog seriously, however.
"You're going to have to do better than that, Hedgehog," he
sneered with all the intensity he could provide.
	To Sally, he said with a note of derision and superiority
directed to Robotnik, "Doesn't he ever get tired?"  Sally could
only smile and shrug with an "I don't know" motion.  "Well, I
do," he continued, "and if this doesn't convince him, I don't
know what will."
	With that said, he generated another vortex, only this time
directed toward the WorkerBots and Packbell located in the
probe.  After finding a suitable opening in the probe, Sonic
vacuumed up and transferred the robots from the probe to
Robotnik's personal Hover Unit.  With that done, his disengaged
his artificial vortex and returned to his position by Sally for
a second time.  He crossed his arms defiantly, glared at
Robotnik, and waited for a response.
	No further verbal exchange or demonstration of will was
necessary between the two adversaries.  Sonic was clearly the
victor in this case, and Robotnik had no way to regain control.
He had lost yet again to the teenage blue hedgehog.  His Hover
Unit promptly made an unfashionable retreat, with all available
power utilized for propulsion, should the hedgehog decide to
make his unspoken threat a reality.
	After Robotnik's departure, Sonic felt all his energy supplied
from the adrenaline pour out of him like water from a waterfall.
 Without any power to even support his balance, Sonic tilted and
fell like a freshly cut tree.  Sally saw his travel to the
ground and managed to catch him before he impacted with the
solid granite.  She looked into his eyes, her face filled with
concern.
	Sonic opened his eyes, and saw his friend's worried mask
through the mud that covered it.  "I'm OK, Sal," he said weakly,
"Going after old 'Buttnik like that wore me out more than I
thought."
	Not totally convinced, she helped him regain his standing
position, still providing as much physical and psychological
support as possible.  She was surprised that he had been able to
expend that much power for so long.  Anyone else would have more
than likely dropped dead with the extreme exhaustion.  Then
again, Sonic wasn't an average hedgehog.
	"Sonic, you've got to stop and rest for a while," she advised
him.  "You haven't eaten anything for a long time.  I'll see if
I can dig something up out of my ration pack.  There has to be
something in there somewhere."
	No bravado response from the hedgehog for that statement.
Sonic was the prime example of someone serious, and wasn't
inclined to engage in his usual cavorting attitude.  This meant
that something was REALLY wrong with her friend.
	"No time," he responded, with the sobriety of voice and mind as
stable as hydrogen gas at absolute zero.  "We've got to destroy
that machine, now."
	Sonic gradually regained a small degree of strength, then
gently pushed Sally away, making his intentions clear with his
body language that his words and judgment were the end of any
further argument over delaying the mission plans.  He had every
intention to destroy the temporal displacement device, even if
the effort killed him.  Mobius would be saved, no matter what
condition Sonic was in.
	He slowly advanced toward the device that was (or in this case
of time, would be) the cause of all their problems.  Sally
walked beside him, keeping her pace equal to his in case he
should fall again.  He maintained his balance the entire ten
meters to the probe, and the remaining five meters to the
weapon's protective shield control panel.  The hedgehog was
beleaguered, but not out yet.
	"Sally," he said finally, with an infinitely tired but
determined voice, "does Nicole understand the circuits under
this control panel?"  After receiving an affirmative nod from
his friend, he carefully retrieved Nicole from her and focused
all his attention on the little computer.  "Nicole," he
commanded, getting some of his more jovial voice back, "pull
that shield off."
	"Accessing circuit pathways," Nicole replied.  She emitted a
tone afterwards, and said, "Circuits inoperative.  Power
required to engage the necessary hardware and software."
	Sonic's face did not alter its form with that statement.  He
searched his mind for what he knew about power supplies.  'So
that's it,' he thought, 'Robotnik must have had some portable
power cells around while he was using the computers.  The
probe's power supply must be down.'  He searched the immediate
area for a clue, and found a suspiciously large conduit along
the left (relative to his position) wall.  The conduit connected
to a metallic sphere.
	"What's this, Nicole?" he asked the small computer.
	"It is an impulse power unit, utilized for the probe's
propulsion or for auxiliary power." she responded.
	"How do we get it working again?" queried the serious and
interested hedgehog.
	"The impulse power unit requires matter/antimatter reactants as
a power source."
	Sonic's heart sank with that statement.  To come all this way,
only to be beaten by advanced and specialized hardware!
	"However," Nicole continued, "the unit may be able to utilize a
power ring if the level input is controlled and monitored."
	Having no words of his own to contribute, Sonic opened the
impulse power unit and inserted his power ring.  He kept his
hands in contact with the power ring, to provide input
regulation and avoid destroying the hardware from uncontrolled
levels of energy.
	"Sally," Sonic called to his friend, "take it from here.  I'm
going to take care of the power supply."
	Sally ran over to Nicole, picked her up, and returned to the
control panel.  After taking her position, she gave her friend a
"go ahead" signal.  The hedgehog confirmed his by concentrating
on the power ring.  The energy input began as a minuscule spark
at first, and then gradually gained strength with every passing
second.
	Sally remotely monitored the energy input into the computers.
When the power reached the required minimum level, she called to
her comrade, "Keep it there, Sonic."  She noticed that Sonic was
straining to keep the power level stable, but he contributed no
complaints in regard to his welfare.  To Nicole, she said,
"Nicole, remove the shield."
	"Accessing, Sally," Nicole replied.  "Circuit pathways
connected."
	With that confirmation came the nearly quiet action of
electromagnetic repulsors slowly removing the protective shield
from the temporal displacement device's haven.  Once the shield
had retracted completely, the computers disengaged the power
supplied to the subunits controlling the shield placement
system.  The device was now exposed for its atrocity, and would
return payment with its destruction.
	Sonic disabled his power transfer and slowly trudged over to
Sally's position.  He glared at the large object ahead of him
with malignance, and said to her, "This thing goes down, today."
	"Wait a minute, Sonic," as she checked over the device's
ambient power levels.  "We have to discharge the energy cells
that power the particle controls.  If we destroy it now, the
explosion could do the same to Mobius."
	"Where's the energy cells?"
	Sally checked the schematics for them.  "They're under the
case, located in the center of the top circuit board."
	"Can I cut through that metal, Sally?" the hedgehog asked, for
he noticed that the metal was unlike anything he had ever seen
before.
	She analyzed the case's composition, and confirmed his request.
 "No problem, Sonic.  Are you sure you want to do this?"
	He replied with a question of his own.  "Is there another way?"
	She checked for anything that might assist in opening the
protective case, for repair points, places for hardware
upgrades, and other possible openings.  Finding none, she shook
her head as if to say "no".
	With that confirmation, Sonic raised his power ring and
concentrated on transferring its energy to his body.  At his low
organic power state, the power ring and what he wanted to
destroy became the only existing objects besides him in his
personal universe.  The power ring now supplied nearly all of
Sonic's energy;  without it, he would be little more than a
vegetable.  He rolled into a ball, and let his spiny back
perform the task for him.  With part of the case shredded off,
he leaped to the center of the top circuit board, where the
energy cells were located.
	A faint, familiar voice called out to him from the darkness.
"Look for the two largest wires in front of you.  Short them
together."
	Sonic found a black and red wire.  He pulled them with what
strength he had left from their sockets.  Finding the bare,
uninsulated copper, he shorted the connections.  The energy
cells responded with a hum, which steadily increased in volume
with every second.  Not the desired effect.
	The familiar voice called to him again, now screaming.  "It's
going to explode!  Get away from there, Sonic!"
	Sonic's mind raced, thinking of ways to avert the imminent
explosion that would take place.  One solution came to mind.
The only alternative to the destruction of Mobius.  He raised
his power ring above him, positioning it perpendicular to the
ground.  He concentrated once again on the power ring as his
other hand wrapped around the improvised shorted connection he
made a few seconds before.
	A blinding flash of light emanated from the power ring.  Sally
shielded her eyes as she attempted to see what act the hedgehog
was performing.  He was using himself and the power ring as a
power transfer point, venting all the energy from the energy
cells to space.  The immense power that surged through him and
the strain to dissipate that energy nearly threw him away from
the circuits, as if the temporal displacement device wanted to
live.  Sonic maintained a firm hold on the wires, not allowing
himself to be subdued by the power that would otherwise advance
toward a catastrophic explosion.  The power ring provided some
protection, but it didn't provide immunity to the device's
retaliation.
	When all the power was drained from the energy cells, Sonic
began the next phase of the operation.  Still clinging to his
power ring, the hedgehog reached his other hand into his
backpack, and it produced three timed-explosive charges.  There
would be more than enough energy unleashed to destroy the device
and the probe, if they were positioned correctly.  He activated
them all simultaneously, then dropped to the floor of the probe
and placed them where they would insure the total fragmentation
of the machine that would have caused so much trouble for
Mobius.  After retrieving Sally for the escape from the
near-future blast radius, he raised his power ring for the last
time, then dashed away into the distance.  Five seconds later,
the probe and its cargo no longer existed on Mobius.
	The two Knothole Freedom Fighters saw the explosion from about
three km away from ground zero.  Mobius was safe again, for at
least one more day.  It had been the first assault from space,
and it was successfully deterred.
	However, there was one war that day which would claim a life.
Sonic was near death, his power ring almost dimmed from the
extensive energy demands that the hedgehog made from it.  He was
surprised that it had lasted for so long, but Charles Hedgehog
had designed them well.  Their life was also his life;  just as
their death was also a mutual demise.  He took one last look at
the carnage that destroyed their ultimate adversary of the day.
	Sally noticed that the power ring was dimming, synchronous with
Sonic's life force which was slowly slipping away.  She knew
what was happening, and was unable to ease her friend's pain or
prevent the shadow of death receiving final payment.  She held
him, looked into his eyes, and kissed him passionately.  They
both knew that this was the last time in this universe that this
particular pair of Freedom Fighters would have the opportunity
to be together.  Their counterparts, the Sonic and Sally
synchronous with time, would never know what happened.  The
mission was a success, but a price had to be paid.
	And the payment was extracted, with no concern for emotion.
Sonic's payment came a few seconds after their last
demonstration of affection.  Sally felt his body turn cold, and
saw his eyes permanently close.  Sally gently lowered Sonic to
the ground, weeping for both of them.  Sonic had met his death,
but he went down fighting every step of the way.
	She buried the savior of Mobius in the best way she knew how,
with the limited materials available in the Great Unknown.  She
regarded his grave, knowing that with time, she too would cease
to exist in this universe.

* * *

	After Sonic's talk with Dulcy, and receiving a demonstration of
her unflagging humor, he and Sally rushed off to the probe's
crash site.  The arrived without incident, but noticed that
something was not there to greet their eyes.  The only evidence
that the probe and the cargo it carried existed was a large
black circular mark on the rock where it landed.  There was no
evidence that Robotnik had ever been there, since the remains of
the SWATBots and Hover Units had been vaporized in the blast
zone.
	"What d'ya suppose happened, Sal?" queried the totally baffled
hedgehog.
	"Hard to say, Sonic," was her only reply, for she was as much
at a loss for words as Sonic.
	"Well, so much for another wartoy that old 'Buttnik could've
used.  Sure would've liked to know what it was though," Sonic
said, trying to solve the mystery of the day and failing.
	"So would have I," said Sally.  "But I guess some things are
better left in the past."
	Sonic signaled to Dulcy for a retrieval.  The pair would never
know how much truth there was to Sally's last philosophical
statement.

First of all, I made a small error in this last post. The Metal Sonic  
appeared in issue #26 - #28 and the complete story has only five parts.

The first two parts tell how Captain Plunder and the Mystic Cave Pirates  
try to steal the Chaos Emeralds from Sonic.

> Thanks for the info!  I really appreciate it.  [We want information...]

Well, in general the comic has a lot of everything, even solo stories with  
Tails or Knuckles as the leading character or stories about Ecco The  
Dolphin, Shinobi, Eternal Champions, Wonderboy etc.

Oh my... I'll try my best:

The 'Enter Knuckles' story is in issue #33 - #34 with leads into
the 'Power Of The Chaos Emeralds' story in issue #35 - #36.

[snip]

Issue #33:
Dr. Robotnik has crash-landed with his space satellite Death Egg II on the  
Floating Island. Sonic & Tails fly to the island to search for him and  
finish him once and for all. After destroying some traps and battling some  
Badniks they meet Robotnik, who has already convinced Knuckles that Sonic  
is the bad guy who wants to steal the Floating Island Chaos Emeralds.

Issue #34:
Sonic & Knuckles have an excessive fight using everything they can offer   
(Sonic running in circles around Knuckles, Knuckles digging underground  
etc.). The fight ends to be a tie, but Tails is able to capture Robotnik
by throwing a net over him. Sonic & Tails escape with the captured  
Robotnik.

Issue #35:
Back at Sonics secret base, Porker Lewis tries to interrogate Robotnik.  
Suddenly Knuckles breaks into the cell to free the doctor. In this moment  
of confusion Robotnik takes Porker Lewis hostage and demands the Chaos  
Emeralds from Sonic. Sonic & Tails try to retrieve the stolen Chaos  
Emeralds from Robotnik and force him to crash land on the Floating Island.

Issue #36:
Again Sonic & Knuckles have a fight. Sonic pretends to be beaten but  
follows Knuckles and Robotnik secretly. Robotnik re-integrates the six  
Chaos Emeralds with the six on the Floating Island (that were once split  
into twelve). Sonic arrives just in time to see Robotnik absorbing the  
chaos energy to become invincible. Knuckles realizes that Robotnik lied to  
him and uses the Master Emerald which he kept hidden to regain control  
over the other emeralds. Robotnik is sent back to Mobius after his new  
powers have been removed. Sonic & Tails leave, Knuckles stays on the  
Floating Island to guard the emeralds.

[snap]

Why don't you order some issues yourself? They are definitely worth the  
money! Stories in a comic book should be read, not summarized. ,-)

Well, its not especially that the drawings are bad, its because IMHO some  
characters differ a lot from what they look like in the sathurday morning  
cartoon. Scott Shaw! had a very detailled way of doing his drawings, and  
he also knew perfectly how to use different perspectives to give the  
reader the feeling to be 'part of the story'.

Darn... I should've known I would be unable to explain all this in  
English... I really should go out and buy a dictionary.

> Not a flame, just my own outlook.

It's ok... but how about doing a quick comparsion between the Archie comic  
Sonic and the Sathurday morning TV Sonic? To draw the characters in a way  
they look like in the cartoon, _that's_ what I think Art Mawhinney (and  
the rest) is unable to do.

Well, I vote for _Sally_ (sorry Craig). But Tails is my second favourite  
Freedom Fighter and comes very close to first place.

BTW, why hasn't anyone voted for Antoine?  .)

As for 'Where did everyone go?'... I fear they all moved to

Is it just me, or do the recent posts by Alessandro (Allesandro?  I can 
never remember which way it goes...) look awfully familiar?  Is there 
some glitch with the listserver, or does our German correspondent need to 
rot-13 my tagline (do it, and you'll get it)?

I don't know what rot-13 means but I got a few posts that looked old to me as

It's a simple cypher, used occasionally in newsgroups (for things like 
punchlines to jokes, spoilers for games, and other things you don't want 
to immediately reveal).  Each letter becomes the letter 13 characters 
earlier (or later) in the alphabet.  The chief virtue of the scheme is 
that it undoes itself.  If you had used a program to decode my tagline, 
or this handy chart:

ABCDEFGHIJKLM
NOPQRSTUVWXYZ

...you would have seen my current tagline; hence, the joke.

ObSonic: Why does anyone think Robotnik was killed in the second season 
finale?  I mean, Sonic *might* think he and Sally had nuked the egghead 
in the whole Power Stone Energy blast (side questions: how long will 
their new powers last?  Were the Deep Power Stones consumed?  If not, how 
long will it take them to fully recharge?), but I'd think he'd want some 
evidence thereof.  As for Snively, he should know better; he *saw* 
Robotnik escaping in that hovercraft...

								  Pangolin Problems, Part 1
										 by Michael Szal
										(bblaze@aol.com)



	"Saaaaaallyyy!" called Tails, as he flew over to her hut.  "Aunt Sally,"
he called again, knocking on the door.  No answer.  "Sally?" he asked, slowly
opening the door.  Nobody was home.  "Too late!" he thought and quickly
headed off toward the War Room.
	The War Room was not much more than another hut.  It got it's name after
Sir Charles build a holographic projector to use as a visual aid for planning
raids, rescues, or other missions to Robotropolis.  Everybody met in the War
Room before a planned mission to work out the details.
	"Sally?" Tails asked again, this time at the front steps of the War Room.
	"Tails?" answered Princess Sally, opening the door.  "What are you doing
here?"
	"I wanna go on the mission too!"
	"I don't think so, Tails.  Not this one, anyway.  It's too dangerous."
	"But I can handle it!  I'm a freedom fighter now, remember?"
	It was true.  Tails was an official freedom fighter, but everybody was
over-protective of him.
	"I think he can do it," defended Sonic.
	"Sonic..." grumbled Sally, "he's only ten years old..."
	"But he's a way cool ten!"
	Sally pulled Sonic away from the doorway into a corner of the room.  "We
can't afford to fail this mission!" she said in a harsh whisper.
	"So you're saying Tails'll screw it up?"
	"No......it's just that......well...fine.  He can come."  She stepped back
into the doorway.  "Okay Tails, here's what you can do."
	They discussed the plan and, after everybody was ready, Sonic lead the way
to the power ring generator.  He always wondered why the thing had to be
underwater, but he knew that Charles must have had his reasons.  It was still
three whole minutes before another ring appeared.  Sonic went over the
mission again.  He was deep in thought when Tails tapped him on the shoulder,
offering him the ring.  He took it and stuffed it in his backpack for later
use.  Sonic let Tails have a head start as they raced toward Robotropolis
whilst Sally rode Dulcy as they flew the aerial route.  It took less than a
minute to get to Robotropolis (Sonic was taking his time) and, not
surprisingly, he got there first.  He was at "the usual" which was a small,
open area surrounded by junk.  Contrary to how it sounds, it was camouflaged
quite well.  If the raiding party had to regroup for any reason, this is
where they'd meet.
	Sonic scanned the skies for a while, which got old fast.  "Where are
they?" he thought out loud.  "They should've been here by now."  And he was
right.  Ten minutes passed with quite a bit of hover units passing by.
"Where ARE they?"

	"It's right behind you!" alerted Sally, ducking laser fire.
	"Hang on," warned Dulcy in just enough time to be too late for Sally to
react.
	She dove, almost straight down, which was followed by a sharp left turn
and then a full loop.  This tactic worked, Dulcy was now behind the pursuing
Stealth-bot, but with one side effect.
	"AAAAAAAAAA!!!" screamed Sally at the top of her lungs.  Unbeknownst to
Dulcy, Sally had fallen off.
	"Great," complained Dulcy, under her breath.  "Couldja' hang on a sec!?!"
	By now, the Stealth-bot had figured out what had happened and was turning
to continue the pursuit.  The other two were far behind.  This gave Dulcy the
opportunity to "postpone" her little encounter and save Sally.
	"I'm coming!" she called.
	She looked down and located Sally, who had been falling for a good four
seconds.  By now, she had fallen well over three hundred feet and in another
four seconds would have fallen eight hundred more.  However, Dulcy had
"cracked the whip" and caught her in little under a second.
	"There now, that wasn't so bad.  You okay, Sally?" polled Dulcy.
	The only sound she got was a quick, soft whisper of "I'm fine," from
Sally.  After Sally caught her breath, she checked for the Stealth-bots and
warned Dulcy as to where they were.  This time she was ready for any more
"stunts" Dulcy was going to pull.
	Sally could feel the centrifugal force holding her in the saddle as Dulcy
pulled up and chased after one of the Stealth-bots.  Dulcy was slowly getting
closer and closer until she finally unleashed a miniature blizzard at the
Stealth-bot.  It froze instantly and dropped like a ton of bricks.
	"One down, two to go!" exclaimed Dulcy after she heard the Stealth-bot
shatter upon impact.
	"There's one off to your left!" said Sally, leaning forward so Dulcy could
hear her.
	"Left?" Dulcy thought to herself.  She had noticed the one on her right.
Then it hit her.  She made a sudden turn to her right and headed straight
toward the Stealth-bot.
	"What are you doing!?!" Sally screamed at her.
	"Trust me!" she replied, dodging laser fire as she went.   At the last
second, she let out a smoke screen and pulled up out of it. The two
Stealth-bots, who couldn't see a thing, crashed right into each other.
	"Next time," suggested Sally, "tell me when you're going to play chicken
with a Stealth-bot."
	They continued their flight to Robotropolis.

	"There's Sonic," Sally pointed out.
	"Okay," replied Dulcy.  "Here I go..." she thought to herself.  "I can do
this.  Just level off.  Level off...  Good.  Slow down.  Okay.  Now land."
The next thing she knew, she was lying on the ground, face down, regaining
consciousness.
	"You okay, Dulce?" asked Sonic.
	"I'm fine, ma," was the reply.
	"Where were you guys?"
	"Sorry, we were in a dogfight," answered Sally.
	"A dogfight?  With who?"
	"A squadron of Stealth-bots."
	"A SQUADRON?  Why was there a squadron out patrolling?"
	"Who knows."
	"There were a lot of hover units around," the intelligible young fox
chimed in.
	"He's right.  What's up with all the security?" asked Sonic.
	"Maybe Robotnik's up to something," replied Dulcy, fully recovered.
	"If he is, we're in trouble," Sally pointed out.  "With all these patrols
around, we're going to have a hard time completing the mission."
	"Right," confirmed Sonic.  "Let's just get the 'bot and get outta here."
	"Okay.  Dulcy, whenever you're ready."
	Dulcy flew up to a ledge on one of the surrounding buildings.  After
looking around, she signaled the "okay...no, wait...okay" sign.  Sally jumped
into Sonic's arms and he took off with Tails close behind.  They were headed
for the Swat-bot production factory.
	They arrived seconds later and all followed Sally as she led the way to an
air vent.  She carefully removed the grate, put it aside, and crawled through
the small passage into the factory.  After everybody was out of the vent,
they spread out, scanning the interior.  It was a vast place, conveyor belts,
cranes, extra Swat-bot parts, yet not a single guard.
	"This is too weird," said Sonic.
	"Agreed," came a reply from Sally at the other end of the factory.
	"Sal?"
	"Over here.  This must be where they put the completed Swat-bots before
shipping them off to their posts and activating them."
	Princess Sally was standing in front of a loading dock.  The Swat-bots
would be left there until a transport shuttle came by to pick them up.
	"Good job, Sal.  Meetchya' outside."
	Sonic dragged one of the Swat-bots back through the vent.  Dulcy was
outside waiting.
	"Here you go, Dulce."
	Sonic heaved the Swat-bot onto Dulcy's back and she took off for Knothole.
Now came the hardest part of the mission: waiting.  He waited...  And
waited...  And waited...  It seemed like hours before Sally and Tails finally
emerged from the vent.  Sally again leaped into Sonic's arms and he once more
tore off into the night to the outskirts of Robotropolis.
	"Nicole," said Sally, "detonate."
	The factory went up in flames.  A nice sized mushroom cloud soon followed.
Then the shock wave.  It was a spectacular light show, but all good things
must come to an end.  After it was over, the three started back toward
Knothole, content in knowing the mission was successful.

	They were greeted at their small village by Rotor with a disturbed look on
his face.
	"Message from Uncle Chuck," he said in a low voice.
	"What does it say?" Sonic wanted to know.
	Rotor handed him the message:

		Robotnik is definitely up to something.  High Security.  Lots of
		patrols.  Working on the details.  Watch for another message.

	"That's it?"
	"That's it."
	"But what could ol' 'Buttnik be doing that Uncle Chuck doesn't know
about?"
	"Hard to say.  Probably something big."
	"At least that explains all the security," concluded Dulcy.  "But let's
worry about that..." she yawned, "...in the morning."
	The group dispersed, each member heading of to his or her hut--except
Rotor.  He stayed up late in his lab, working on the Swat-bot.

	"Snively!" Doctor Robotnik contacted him via hologram.  "Have you finished
your interrogation?"
	Snively was in a small, enclosed room with a single chair in the center
and a bright light aimed at it.  It was one of the many interrogation rooms
Robotnik had created.  There were six Swat-bots assisting him, two guarding
the door, three guarding the prisoner, and one off in a corner.  Robotnik
does not usually have this many guards assigned to a single prisoner.  Even
if a few of the prisoners did escape, where would they go?
	Snively gasped.  "Well...uh...no, sir.  Not yet," answered Snively.  "He
refuses to talk, sir."
	"Loosing your touch?"  Robotnik thought back to when Commander Packbell
arrived with the prisoners and wondered why he let Snively do the
interrogating.
	"No, sir...it's just that...well, sir, we can't kill him."
	"Then roboticize him, fool!  His secrets will be ours!"
	"Yes--" the hologram was gone, "--sir," Snively mumbled to himself.  "Then
roboticize him, fool!  Hmph!  I'll show you roboticizing!"  He stormed off
down the hall.  "Bring the prisoner!" he called behind him.
	The three Swat-bots guarding the prisoner escorted him to the door with
the Swat-bot in the corner leading the way, obviously designated as the
unofficial leader.  The other two at the door waited until everybody had left
before bringing up the rear.
	"I don't think so," the prisoner announced.  "Computer, retrieve all data
from the Swat-bots, then delete all their data."  All the Swat-bots suddenly
fell flat on their faces.
	Snively heard the noise and spun around to find the prisoner escaping.
"Get back here!" he demanded.  "What are you waiting for!?!" he yelled at the
Swat-bots.  "Get him!  Get him!"  They did nothing.

	"What do you mean you LOST him!?!" asked Robotnik, holding Snively up to
his face.
	Snively swallowed hard.  "Well, sir..."
	"How can you lose a prisoner with SIX Swat-bots as escort!?!"
	"You see, sir..." Snively replied with sweat pouring down his face.  "All
their data is gone, sir."
	"WHAT!?!"
	"I-I-I can't explain it, sir.  All data in the Swat-bots was deleted."
	"That's IMPOSSIBLE!!!" Robotnik said, throwing Snively back on the ground.
	"Find him, Snively!  He cannot get away!"
	"Y-Y-Yes, sir."
	After Snively left to assemble his search party, Robotnik walked back to
his chair and sat down.  He pressed a button, "Packbell!" he ordered.
	A few seconds later a hologram appeared before him.  "Yes, sir," Packbell
awaited orders.
	"Whatever you're doing can wait!"

								  Pangolin Problems, Part 2
										 by Michael Szal
										(bblaze@aol.com)



	Rotor emerged from his lab early the next morning.  It was fairly dark for
morning, and cold.  He looked up and saw the dark, looming clouds overhead.
"Rain," he thought to himself and made his way over to the center of the
village. Bookshire was already there, sitting at a table.
	"Do you always get up this early?" Rotor asked.
	"No, not always," Bookshire calmly answered.  "Can't get the Swat-bot to
activate?"
	"I've tried everything I can think of and it just sits there.  It all
seemed so easy.  Just steal a Swat-bot and examine it's technology."
	"Could I take a look at it?"
	"Go ahead."
	Bookshire suddenly got up and hurriedly limped over to Rotor's lab.
	"I'll need your help!" he called behind him.
	Once in the lab, Bookshire knew exactly what to do.  "We'll both grab an
arm and drag it over to my place."
	They took the Swat-bot to Bookshire's hut and put it on a table.  It was
Bookshire's first time being able to carefully examine a Swat-bot and he was
very excited.  He searched for some sort of serial port on the Swat-bot.
Turning the head to one side, he opened a small panel and there it was.  He
opened another small panel, this time on his computer, and a cable ejected
from it.  Taking the cable in one hand, he pulled it over to the port in the
Swat-bot's head, neatly unwinding as it went, and plugged it in.
	"Okay, computer," Bookshire told it, "open a direct link through port A."
	"Open," the computer reported.
	"Access the main memory matrix."
	"Access denied."
	"As expected.  Try it again using Cryptosmasher software."
	The computer worked on it for a second and reported, "Access granted."
	"Display the boot-up data."
	The screen started to fill with a bunch of seemingly random characters.
	"Wait, wait, wait.  Decompile it first."
	It took a bit longer to do this, but soon the gibberish stopped and was
replaced with (somewhat) plain English.  Bookshire was very excited now, he
started to look through the code.  Rotor sat and watched.  It was a long
while before anybody spoke again.
	"Getting anywhere?" Rotor asked rhetorically.
	"Actually, yes," answered Bookshire.
	"What did you find out?"
	"Well, it won't activate because somebody doesn't want it to."
	"What do you mean?"
	"The Swat-bot's fine.  Nothing is actually 'wrong' with it."
	"Buuuuut..." Rotor said slowly.
	"But somebody altered the boot-up data so that it won't activate
unless..."
	"Unleeeeess..." he urged Bookshire on.
	"Ah!  Here it is!  Unless you find the problem and fix it."
	"Isn't that what you're supposed to do when there's a problem--fix it?"
	"Well, yes.  But normally when somebody sabotages something, they don't
intend for it to be fixed."
	"So you're saying that somebody sabotaged this Swat-bot, possibly many
others, and wanted Robotnik to know about it."
	"Exactly.  It was pretty hard to find the problem, but whoever did this
definitely wanted Robotnik to find it."
	"But......why?"
	"Because of this: computer, display string: 'problem.'"
	A few lines of text were displayed.  Rotor read it aloud:

		Dear Robotnik,
			It's been a while.  How are things going?  Looking forward to a
		reply.  Send Snively to following co-ords, haven't seen him in a while:
		33 S, 75 E.

	"Send Snively?  If this guy's working for Robotnik, why would he put his
message in a Swat-bot?"
	"I have no idea."
	"Maybe we should tell Sally."

	"Snively!" Robotnik's face appeared in one of the monitors of Snively's
hover unit.  "Have you located the prisoner yet?"
	"Well," said Snively, "no, sir.  But he couldn't have gotten far."  He
turned to another console and pushed a few buttons.  "Stealth-bots, Epsilon
squadron, report."  There came no reply.  "Report, Epsilon!"  Still no reply.
"Theta squadron, report."  No reply from them either.  Snively was getting
nervous.  "Alpha squadron?"  No reply.  "Beta?"  No reply.  "Anybody!?!"
	"I don't like what I'm hearing, Snively."
	Snively was shaking now.  "It seems that communications are down,
s-s-sir."
	"Then get them back up!  I don't want--"
	"Hello, Robotnik."  It was the prisoner, on every monitor.  "Having fun?"
	"What are you doing on my communications channel?" asked Robotnik.
	"Oh, nothing much.  Just getting revenge.  I mean, you DID try to
roboticize me."  Robotnik was just about to speak when the prisoner spoke
first, "Don't worry, I'm not taking it personally.  I'll just have my revenge
and leave you alone."  He walked off the screen for a few seconds and came
back grinning.  Suddenly, the entire city lost power.
	"How can he DO that!?!" Robotnik called out.  "Were you tracing that?" he
asked Packbell, who had been in the room with Robotnik, working on the
location of the prisoner.
	"Of course.  Omega squadron is on their way."
	"Excellent!  Let's go!"

	Rotor and Bookshire headed over to Sally's hut where they found her and
Bunny deep in a conversation.
	"Glad you're here," Sally greeted them.  "We got another note from Uncle
Chuck.  It says:

	A prisoner escaped yesterday and blacked out the entire city.  Better send
	Sonic for all the details.

	"Where's Sonic?" asked Rotor.
	"He left about ten minutes ago.  Do you have any clue as to what this
means?"
	"I'd say so," said Bookshire.   He explained in detail what he had found
in the Swat-bot.
	"It's obviously the work of another freedom fighter," hypothesized Sally.
	"It can't be any old freedom fighter," Bookshire told her.  "Don't you
see?  Nobody can just black out a city.  Whoever did this is an extremely
powerful individual."
	"Maybe Naugus found a way back from that void place," said Bunny.
	"No," contributed Sally, "Naugus would take care of Robotnik directly.
Whoever it is would be an invaluable addition to Knothole."
	"But how can we find this person?" asked Rotor.
	"I guess we'll just have to wait for--"  Sally was just finishing her
sentence as Sonic came through the door with Charles right behind.
	"I think you guys better hear this," suggested Sonic.
	"Three days ago," Charles began, "Robotnik's forces overpowered a small
village just outside the Great Swamp.  The prisoners were taken back to
Robotropolis to await robotization.  The very next day, most of them were
roboticized.  Some of them Robotnik kept to be interrogated.  Yesterday, one
of the prisoners escaped during the interrogation.  Just this morning, he
blacked out all of Robotropolis."
	"If he's so powerful, why not just overthrow Robotnik?" asked Sally.
	"Maybe he can't," assumed Bunny.
	"Not from what I just heard," said Bookshire.  "This person can do
anything, he just doesn't want to."
	"Doesn't want to!?!" Sonic entered the conversation.  "We need to find
this guy and bring him back here!"
	"WE?" rebutted Sally.  "WE won't be able to get anywhere NEAR Robotropolis
with all the patrols out looking for him."
	"Then WE will just have to get a power ring."  Sonic had already made up
his mind and was exiting the room.

	Lights everywhere were turning back on.  "Sir," came Snively.
	"What is it, Snively?" Robotnik impatiently asked.  He had more important
things to attend to.
	"The power is back on-line."
	"I noticed.  Thank you, Snively."  He put his communicator down.  "Move
aside," ordered Robotnik as he pushed two Swat-bots out of his way.  There
were at least fifteen others, each with a laser rifle aimed at the prisoner,
who was sitting in the middle of it all.  Six Stealth-bots hovered overhead.
"So..." said Robotnik confidently.  "The tables have turned.  Would you like
to answer some questions now?"
	"Under normal circumstances," said the prisoner as if he was negotiating
with Robotnik, "this would be a dire situation.  But there's been this dragon
flying around and--"
	"Dragon?" said Robotnik in disbelief as he flung around and looked up.
There was Dulcy, circling the area.  "The hedgehog!  All units, full alert!
Activate heat scanners!  You two," he pointed to two Stealth-bots, "get that
dragon!"
	"Hedgehog detected," said one of the Swat-bots in its monotonous voice.
	Sonic came around a corner, dodging lasers, and charged a Swat-bot.  At
the last second, he curled up with quills blazing and sliced right through
it.  He then grabbed the prisoner and continued onward to Knothole with Dulcy
not far behind.  The Swat-bots took their last, futile shots at Sonic as he
disappeared over the horizon.
	"I HATE you, Hedgehog!" Robotnik called after him.

	The team regrouped in the war room, with just about everybody else, and
immediately began an interrogation of their "prisoner."  Now they could get a
close look at him.  He looked like an armadillo, and yet, was not.  He was
definitely older than sixteen, but nobody was quite sure by how much.  Sonic,
realizing that there were more important aspects to a person besides physical
characteristics, began the interrogation.
	"Okay, bud," said Sonic, "why'd you blow our cover?  You could've ruined
the whole operation!"
	"Part of the reason is that I didn't know who was flying around up there,
and I still don't," said the prisoner, looking at Dulcy.
	"Oh, I'm Dulcy," she answered.
	"Hello, Dulcy.  You can call me Williams.  The other part is that it
distracted Robotnik so I could escape, but I see Sonic rescued me first," he
said, nodding in Sonic's direction.
	"You know who I am?" asked Sonic.
	"Sure.  Robotnik always talks about you.  Boy, he REALLY hates you.  Did
you know that you've been officially declared the 'priority hedgehog?'"
	"You can access his computer core?" asked Rotor.
	"Of course.  Contrary to popular belief, living in a tiny village in the
middle of nowhere DOES get boring.  It's amazing what you can do when you're
bored."
	"So you can break into Robotnik's systems any time you want without him
knowing about it and you never bothered to disable any of them?" asked Sally.
	"Why should I?"
	Sally was agitated.  "Maybe it would be a little easier to win the war if
Robotnik didn't have any defenses, don't you think?"
	"War?  I wouldn't consider this a war.  Think of it as a change it
government," said Williams with an optimistic smile.
	Sally was angry.
	"Speaking of wars, I thought Mobitropolis was supposed to have a huge,
powerful army.  Didn't WE win the Great War?  Where was our army when
Robotnik took over?"
	He already knew the answer.  After the Great War, the king gave his
permission for Robotnik to dismantled the army.  (Back then no one ever
suspected him of plotting against the king.)  Instead, he improved it and
used it to take over the planet.  Mobitropolis had been conquered by it's own
army.
	Sally was very angry.
	"Isn't it true that your father was the cause of the whole thing?  Maybe
he planned--"
	"STOP IT!!!"  Sally was enraged.  "My father was an honest, trustworthy
man and would never, EVER start a war that takes innocent lives!"  She ran
out of the room.
	"Sally!" called Dulcy as she went out after her.
	"You're worse than Robuttnik," accused Sonic.  He began his search for
Sally and Dulcy.
	That left Rotor and Antoine.
	"What I want to know," asked Rotor, "is who put the message in the
Swat-bot?"
	"I did," answered Williams.  "Robotnik doesn't pay any attention to them
anymore, but they give me something to do."
	"I'm assuming you're also the one who blacked out Robotropolis?"
	"Uh, huh," he nodded.
	"That brings me back to Sally's question.  If you're against Robotnik, why
not just end the war now?"
	"First of all, I'm not in this war.  Think of me as an impartial
observer."
	"Impartial observers don't black out cities."
	"Only when they're captured, interrogated, and almost roboticized.
Secondly, this is Knothole, right?  Robotnik's been looking for this place
for years.  I could tell him where it is and end the war that way.  In fact,
why don't I do that.  Computer, transmit current coordinates to everywhere in
Robotropolis.  You better hope Robotnik isn't looking at a monitor right
now."
	"You fuel!" screamed Antoine.  "You are going to get us all captivated!"
He ran out of the room, screaming for somebody to come help him.  Soon after,
Sonic came rushing to his rescue.
	"What is it now, Ant?"
	"We are all doom-ed, DOOM-ED!"
	Rotor emerged from the War Room.  "Williams gave away Knothole's location.
Robotnik could be on his way right now."
	By now, Sally had arrived with Bunny.  "What is going on?" asked Sally.
	"Williams told Robotnik where Knothole is," answered Sonic.
	"He's gone WAY too far this time," said Sally.
	Bookshire had an idea of what was going on, so he entered the War Room and
closed the door behind him.  As he did, Williams stopped transmitting.
	"You didn't really give away our location, did you?" he asked Williams,
expecting an answer.
	"Yeah, why?"
	That wasn't the answer he was expecting.  "I can't believe you.  You've
got the whole village scared to death that they'll all be roboticized, and
they just might be!  What are you going to do now?"
	"I'll just slip out through the window and leave you to explain
everything."
	"I wouldn't come back anytime soon, if I were you.  It seems the entire
village hates you."
	"But you don't hate me."
	"I'm not sure what to think."
	And with that, Williams was gone.  Bookshire faced the mob of panicked
citizens and explained what had happened.  A few accusations against him
later, the crowd had dispersed and things were returning to normal.
	"Ah'm sure glad that's over," Bunny voiced her opinion to Sally as they
walked back to their huts.
	"Me too," replied Sally.  "I guess if Robotnik was going to attack,
he'd've been here by now.  I bet Tails is--"  She stopped walking.
	"What's wrong, Sally-girl?"
	"Have you seen Tails lately?"
	"No, but--"
	Sally didn't care to hear the rest.  She quickly found Sonic, also headed
for his hut, and asked him the same question.
	"Nope, not since we left to go find that Williams guy," he said.
	They both started to worry.  Usually, Tails is were the action is.  They
checked their huts and anywhere else Tails might have gone, but he was no
where to be found.

								  Pangolin Problems, Part 3
										 by Michael Szal
										(bblaze@aol.com)



	Williams was well into the Great Forest by now and was thinking of where
to go next when he heard something behind him.  He ignored it, forcing
himself to believe it was just a small animal--he WAS in a forest.  Back to
the problem of where to go next.  Maybe he'd go to back to his village and
take what he could from what was left of it.  Or maybe he'd--  He heard the
sound again.  There was definitely something following him.  Ideas raced
through his mind.  A huge, carnivorous animal?  An army of Swat-bots?  He
took out his computer and scanned behind him to see what it was.  A small
fox?  He turned around.
	"Hellooooo..." he called out.  "C'mon out."
	Tails stepped out from behind the bush.  He was where the action is after
all.  Williams sat down at the base of a tree and groaned.  Tails ran over
and sat down next to him.
	"You're that kid from Knothole, right?" Williams started the conversation,
not looking at Tails.
	"Yep.  I'm Tails."
	Williams groaned again.  "You can't be here, not after what just
happened."
	"Why not?  Did you really tell Robotnik where Knothole is?"
	"Yes, well...no.  I didn't TELL him, I just sent him my location.  He
probably just ignored it."  A moment of silence.  "I'm not evil, but the rest
of Knothole certainly thinks so.  Which is why you can't be here.  They're
probably looking for you and think I kidnapped you.  Why ARE you here
anyway?"
	"I wanted to see where you were going.  Why can't you live with us?"
	"Well, besides the fact that nobody would let me, there's always the fact
that if I lived with you, that would mean I'd be on your side and against
Robotnik."
	"Are you on Robotnik's side?"
	"No.  How can I explain?  I'm not for Robotnik, but I'm not against him
either."
	"So you're neutral."
	"Nnnnno.  Neutral implies not getting involved.  And I'm really involved
now."  There was a short moment of silence after which Williams stood up,
looked down at Tails, and said, "I'll be leaving now, you'll have to go."
	"But I wanna come with you," said Tails, also standing up.  "You're almost
as cool as Sonic!"
	"I'll take that as a complement."  More silence.  "You can come, but if
anything happens, just do as I say and everything will be all right."
	"Cool."
	They started their journey to the Great Swamp.  Not five minutes later,
they were attacked.  Williams was knocked in the back of the head by a large
branch and fell to the ground, stunned for now.
	When he came to, he realized what had happened.  He was sitting up against
a tree with his hands tied behind his back and saw Tails against another tree
across from him, also apparently tied.  A seemingly tall woman approached him
with a laser rifle.
	"You're awake.  Good.  Get up, both of you.  We're going to the Great
Swamp."
	They both got up.  Williams was the first to talk.  "Who--"
	"Shut up.  Questions will be answered when we get there.  You will lead
the way.  Try anything and you will die."
	As they walked, Williams was trying to think of when everything went
wrong.  Three days ago, everything was fine.  Then they were attacked.  He
was taken prisoner and spent the night in a cell.  The next night, he was
interrogated.  Then the escape and the night was spent in an air duct.  He
was found and captured the next morning, which is when Sonic rescued him.
Then came the Knothole incident and afterwards he found Tails.  Now he's
being led to the Great Swamp by a woman with a gun trained on him and is
responsible for a young fox's safety.
	"All in all, it's been a pretty good day," he said to himself.
	"No talking," came the woman's voice from behind him.

	"He's not in Knothole," reported Sonic.  "I've searched everywhere."  The
group had, once again, met in the War Room to try to solve this mess.
	"Then Williams must have kidnapped him," said Sally.  "I knew he was a spy
from Robotropolis!  I bet 'Williams' isn't even his real name!"
	"I don't know," explained Bookshire.  "If he's with Robotnik, why did
Robotnik capture him, and why did he black out the city?"
	"If he isn't with Robotnik, why did he give us away?" Sonic brought up a
good point.
	"It was all just an act.  Robotnik's probably sitting in his chair
laughing, knowing he has us right where he wants us," assumed Sally.
	"Then let's find out," suggested Bookshire.  "I'll just check his main
computer core to see if there's anything about Williams or Tails."
	They were off to Bookshire's hut.
	"Computer," ordered Bookshire, "access the Robotropolis Main Computer Core
using Cryptosmasher software."
	"Access granted," reported the computer.
	"Scan the entire core for anything about the name 'Williams.'"
	"Scanning.........  No files found."
	"Scan for anything about Tails being captured."
	"Scanning.........  No files found."
	"Scan for anything about relating to a prisoner that escaped yesterday."
	"Scanning.........  One file found."
	"Show me."
	"Access denied.  Level four security clearance required."
	"Forge it."
	"Access granted."
	The file was displayed.  Bookshire read it and summarized it for the rest
of the group.
	"Basically, it confirms the story that a prisoner was captured in a raid
and escaped interrogation, the same prisoner that Sonic rescued.  This was
level four, I don't think it's fake.  Williams is not on Robotnik's side."
	"Then why would he kidnap Tails?" Sally still wanted to know.
	"Maybe he didn't, but whatever the case, we need to find Tails."
	"Agreed.  Sonic, you search Robotropolis, Dulcy, you and I will search the
Great Forest."

	It was a long while before they finally made it to their destination and
they were all tired.  Williams and Tails sat down and got as comfortable as
they could, considering their condition.
	"How about untying us now?  If we try to escape, you can kill us."
	Tails immediately looked at Williams at the sound of being shot.
	"It's okay," he said to Tails, "just don't try to escape and she won't
kill you."
	Tails was unsure about this plan.
	"Deal," the woman said.  She walked over to Tails, crouched down, and
untied his hands, being careful not to let Williams out of her sight.  Tails,
in turn, made his way to Williams and untied his hands.
	"Who are you?" asked Williams.
	"The name is Sandra Nightweaver.  I deal in information.  Who are you?"
	Williams looked at Tails, hoping he'd understand, then back at Sandra.
"I'm Xero, this is Tails, we're Knothole defectors.  Why do you want us?"
	"Oh, I don't want you, Packbell does.  Strange, he said that you're a
fugitive of some kind."
	"Yeah, well I am.  I escaped from my cell, Tails happened to be in the
same cell as me.  Almost made it to Knothole.  Hey Tails, you okay?...
Tails?...  Tails!  He's dehydrated!  You can't expect him to walk this far
without water!  Get him some water!  If he dies, Packbell would be very
disappointed!"
	Sandra just stood there.
	"You're good," noticed Williams.
	"If you want to escape, you haven't got much time left until noon.
Besides, Packbell doesn't want HIM."  She aimed the rifle at Tails.  "He's
expendable."
	Williams stood between her and Tails.  "Uh, yeah.  But right now I'm kinda
responsible for his life, so if Packbell doesn't want him, why not let him
go?"
	"Because he's my prisoner and I don't want to let him go.  Now sit down,
Zero or One or whatever kind of a stupid name you have."
	He obeyed.  "Sigh," he sighed.  "Must I explain everything?  It's Xero,
with a 'Xi.'  Not naught."  A short silence.  "How much is Packbell paying
you?"
	"He gave me this laser rifle and, when the operation is complete, a hover
unit."
	"Wow.  Hover unit.  You do a lot of work for Robotnik?"
	"I don't work for Robotnik.  I work for whoever hires me."
	"Ohhhhh," said Williams, nodding.  "So if I give you something better than
a hover unit, you'll let us go?"
	"Maybe."
	A long silence.  No one moved, no one talked.  Each of them looked at one
another, thinking about the situation.  Williams was looking at Tails when he
realized that Tails had not said a word ever since they were captured in the
Great Forest.
	"Tails," Williams broke the silence, "you okay, for real?"
	"Sonic would've saved us by now.  I'll probably never see Vixie again."
	"Vixie?"
	"Never mind."
	"I'm sure Sonic's out looking for us right now.  But everything will be
fine as soon as Packbell comes."
	Tails was puzzled about what Williams just said.  It sounded wrong.  "I
thought Packbell was gonna roboticize us?  That's bad, right?"
	"Not really.  I'll explain.  You and I have the one most important thing
it takes to win this war: intelligence.  With it, you can do anything."
	"Then why are we stuck here?"
	"You underestimate me.  Life is just a game.  You only get one, so you
have to make it as interesting as possible.  This war gives you the chance to
do that.  When it's over, you can tell your kids all about how you helped win
it.  Chances are, their lives won't be nearly as exciting as yours.  You may
not think so, but you're a very lucky person."
	"YOU may think it's fun, but I don't.  Not after my parents were
roboticized."
	"Ha!  I was there when it all started.  Everybody I knew had been
roboticized.  I narrowly escaped certain doom and lived here, in a village
near the Great Swamp.  Just three days ago, Packbell found us and took us all
to Robotropolis.  I was the only one to escape."  Williams was just getting
started when he was rudely interrupted by Sandra, who had shot Tails.
	"Hey!" shouted Williams.  "We had a deal!  You could kill him, but ONLY if
he was trying to escape!"
	"Oh shut up!  He's not dead, just stunned.  Your annoying little life
story was getting to me."
	"You wanted ME to shut up so you shot Tails," illogically concluded
Williams.
	"I couldn't risk killing YOU.  You're the one Packbell wants."
	Williams groaned.  He attended to Tails, who was fine but unconscious.
	"Here."  Sandra threw Williams her rifle.  "I'll be back," she said and
was gone.

	"Nothing," reported Sonic as he arrived back in the War Room.  He was the
last to stop searching.
	"He HAS to be SOMEWHERE," said Sally.  "Tails wouldn't just wander off
alone.  The ONLY explanation is that Robotnik has him somewhere."
	"That's impossible, Sal.  I checked with Uncle Chuck.  There's nothing
going on down there."
	"There has to be!"
	"Whoah, Sal.  You need a nap."
	"I'm sorry.  I'm under a lot a stress right now.  First Williams, now
Tails.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see who finds him."
	"He can take care of himself."
	"I certainly hope so."

	In five short minutes, Sandra did indeed come back with a small pouch
around her neck.  "Some food and water rations," she said, offering the bag.
	"Oh, I see.  First you try to kill him, then you offer him food.  I guess
I never will understand the female mind.  You hungry?" he asked Tails,
opening the bag.
	Tails had regained consciousness, but was still a bit groggy.  He mumbled
something and held out his hand.  Williams gave him the bag.  Knowing that
Tails was taken care of, he turned his attention to Sandra.
	"How did you know you could trust me?"  He handed Sandra her gun back.  "I
could've escaped when you were gone.  Or I could've shot you just now."
	"Besides being annoying, your little story revealed a lot about yourself.
I shot Tails to test my theory.  If you were here when I came back, I was
right.  If not, I didn't get my hover unit."
	"You still didn't explain how we're going to escape," asked Tails.
	"It's quite simple, Sandra gives us to Packbell and gets her hover unit.
We get Packbell to take you back to Knothole.  I let him take me to
Robotropolis.  Everybody's happy."
	"But..."  Tails was worried.  "You'll be..."
	"I'll be having the time of my life, trust me."
	The trio waited for Commander Packbell to arrive.  And arrive he did.
Sandra retreated deeper into the swamp, so as not to let Packbell see her.
Two hover units landed in the middle of their "camp site."  The pilot of
Sandra's hover unit, a Swat-bot, got out and escorted the prisoners to the
transport.
	"Good bye!" Williams called into the swamp, knowing Sandra was there.
"And have fun!"  He was loaded onto the ship.
	"I know you are there, Sandra," announced Packbell.  "Here is your hover
unit."  He also got into the ship and took off for Robotropolis.
	"Are you prepared for the end of your natural life?" Packbell asked
Williams.
	"Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen.  Computer, scramble the
Swat-bot."
	The copilot made a few jerky movements, then lay limp in its chair.
	"Wow!  How'd you do that?" inquired Tails.
	"What have you done!?!" asked Packbell, scrambling for a weapon of some
sort.
	"Nothing much, I just randomized every bit of information stored in the
Swat-bot.  Computer, scramble Pack--"
	"No!  Wait!"  Packbell seemed frightened for his life--he couldn't find a
weapon.
	"Computer, stand by to scramble Packbell."
	"What do you want?"
	"Take us to Knothole."
	"If I knew where Knothole was, I would have seized it long ago."
	"I wouldn't talk to the person who has your life in his hands like that.
Tails, you know where you live, fly us there."
	"I can't fly a hover unit," explained Tails.
	"Well, here's your chance to learn.  We've got time.  Press some buttons,
flip some switches, have fun!  It's not like Packbell will even THINK of
hurting you."
	Tails climbed into the front seat, pushing the Swat-bot onto the floor.
	"HE will never be able to get us ANYWHERE," observed Packbell.
	"HE is incredulously intelligent and will learn.  And from now on, you
will refer to him as 'Supreme Emperor of All Time and Space.'"
	"And what shall I call you?  'Lord of Mobius?'"
	"No, you may call me Williams."  The ship suddenly shot forward, then
stopped.  "Getting anywhere, Emperor?"
	Tails giggled.  He liked the feeling of being in control, of having power.
"Here we go."  He turned the hover unit around (sharply), then headed towards
Knothole.
	"The little twit will kill us all," warned Packbell.  "You cannot just get
into a hover unit and fly away."
	"WHO will kill us all?" asked Williams.
	"The Supreme Emperor of All Time and Space," Packbell corrected his
warning.
	"Very good!  And if he does kill us all, you can blame me."
	Tails landed the hover unit right in the middle of town, where everybody
could see.  As the door opened, a hush fell over the crowd that gathered.
Tails stepped out and took a bow.  Sally pushed her way through the cheering
crowd and hugged Tails as hard as she could.
	"I was so worried!" she exclaimed with a few tears rolling down her cheek.
"I'm glad you're back!  Where have you been?  Are you okay?"
	As they were talking, Williams appeared in the doorway.  "Sorry to leave
so soon, but I have an unscheduled appointment with Robotnik."  The hover
unit took off for Robotropolis.
	"Why was he in there?  Why were YOU in there?  Oh, I'm glad you're back!
What happened?"
	Tails was really excited.  "I followed Williams into the Great Forest,
then we were attacked by Sandra and taken to the Great Swamp."
	"You were attacked!?!  Did she hurt you?"
	"No, not until we got to the Great Swamp, then Williams tried to save us
but it didn't work, so she shot me."
	"My gosh!  She shot you!?!  Are you okay!?!"
	"Yep, fine Aunt Sally.  I was only unconscious for a few minutes.  Then
Packbell came and traded Sandra a hover unit for us, but then Williams let me
fly the hover unit and made Packbell call me the Supreme Emperor of All Time
and Space!"
	"This guy's good," complimented Sonic.
	"But you were shot!  I'll never forgive him!" vowed Sally.
	"It wasn't his fault, Aunt Sally.  He stood between Sandra and me.  But
now..."  Tails' tone of voice lowered.  He spoke a bit slower and fought back
a tear.  "Now he's Packbell's prisoner."
	"You mean to tell me," said Sonic in disbelief, "that he got you to fly a
hover unit with Packbell next to you in the cockpit, and now he's giving
himself up?"
	"He even said he would," confirmed Tails.  "He said that Sandra got her
hover unit, I got home, and Packbell got his prisoner."

								  Pangolin Problems, Part 4
										 by Michael Szal

	"Okay Packbell," said Williams, "you can take me to Robotnik now.
Computer, unscramble the Swat-bot."
	The Swat-bot on the floor, where Tails had left him, got up and returned
to normal as if nothing happened.
	"How can you undo a random process?" Packbell wanted to know.
	"Only an idiot does something he can't undo," was all Williams said.
	"The Swat-bots you disabled earlier, you have all the data that was lost?"
	"Of course.  When we get to Robotropolis, I won't mention anything about
Tails or being taken against your will."
	Packbell was extremely confused.  If Williams didn't want to be a
prisoner, why was he giving in?  He certainly had the ability to escape.  All
he had to do was tell his computer--  His computer!  That was the key!
	"Give me your computer," ordered Packbell.
	"Huh?"
	"Give me that computer of yours."
	Williams laughed out loud.  "I'm not your prisoner!" he managed to say,
still laughing.  "I'm just visiting Robotnik to help him out and what not."
	Packbell utilized all available data and still could not find any reason
for this kind of behavior.  In his experience, nobody ever wanted to help
Robotnik.
	"If you are a freedom fighter," said Packbell, "why do you not resist?"
	"I just disabled a Swat-bot and threatened to do the same to you.  You
don't call that resistance?"
	"That is what I mean.  Why do you help a freedom fighter, then turn around
and help Robotnik?"
	"I guess there are just some things you will never understand."
	The rest of the trip was spent in silence.  When they arrived at
Robotropolis, Williams was escorted to Robotnik's lair.
	"Commander Packbell," greeted Robotnik, "I see you've brought me my
prisoner."
	"I am in no way here against my will," stated Williams.
	Robotnik looked at Packbell as if this was all just a joke.
	"It is true.  He can leave at any time."
	"Why can't you stop him?"  Robotnik seemed worried.
	"I came here to help you out," said Williams, "and you treat me like one
of your prisoners."
	"Packbell, seize him!"
	Packbell took one look at Williams and remembered what had happened to the
Swat-bot.  "No," he disobeyed.
	"I'll seize him myself."  Robotnik started to approach Williams.
	"Computer, now."
	Robotnik's robotic arm suddenly grabbed his neck and started to strangle
him.
	"What...is...going...on..." he somehow managed to force air out of his
lungs even though his throat was being crushed.
	"Computer, stop."
	The hand let go.
	"I knew you were going to try something.  You're a bit behind in this
conversation.  Packbell and I are on 'I'm here to help you.'  You're way back
at 'seize him.'  If you want my help, I suggest you cooperate.  If not,
Packbell and I will go back to Knothole and rule the world from there."
	"Packbell?"  Robotnik directed his attention to the android.  "You were at
Knothole?  And you didn't tell me!?!"
	"Yes," he stood behind Williams.
	"Whose side are you on!?!"
	Packbell didn't dare say what was on his mind.  "If only our positions
were reversed," he was thinking.  "This person has complete control over me,
what am I to do about it!?!"  He told Robotnik what he wanted to hear,
"Yours, sir."
	"Then take him prisoner!  Now!"
	"Okay, that's it!"  Williams was fed up.  "I'll be leaving now.  Don't
expect me to help you."  He turned around and was about leave when Sonic came
rushing in with four Swat-bots behind him.  "You have to show up at the worst
possible times, don't you?"
	"Grab on!  We're gettin' outta here!" ordered Sonic.
	Packbell took the initiative and tried to grab Sonic, but was too slow.
Sonic had already grabbed Williams and was headed for the door when he was
cut off by the pursuing Swat-bots.  He stopped, turned around and took off in
the opposite direction.  The next thing he knew, he was face up on the
ground.  Williams had held on to his backpack so when he took off his feet
went forward and the rest of him stayed.  Packbell reached down and picked
Sonic up.
	"Hey!  Put me down!"
	"I've always wanted to know what you keep in here..."  Williams opened up
Sonic's backpack.
	"What're you doin'!?!"
	He rummaged through the pack.  "A power ring...  Infra-red goggles?..." he
put them on.  "Hee, hee!  Very cool."  He didn't have a neat backpack like
Sonic, so he wore the goggles over his forehead.
	"Well..." started Robotnik.
	"Williams," continued Williams.
	"Well, Williams.  I see I've underestimated you."
	"People tend to do that.  Want a ring?"  He tossed the power ring to
Robotnik like a frisbee.  "Now what?  We roboticize him?"
	"What!?!" complained Sonic.
	"What do you mean 'what?'  You trust me, don't you?"
	"Not any more, bud."
	Williams groaned.  He turned to Robotnik, "You trust me, right?"
	"Not yet."
	He groaned again.  "Trapped in the middle," he said to himself.
	On the way to the roboticizer, Sonic said some things to the effect of
"you'll never get away with this" and "you can roboticize me, but there will
be others."  In the end, they were all in front of that small, diamond-glass
tube.
	Sonic was being lead inside by Packbell when Robotnik interrupted him.
	"No.  Put the armadillo in first."
	"I am NOT an armadillo!" corrected Williams as he was being lead inside by
two Swat-bots.  "See this tail?  Do armadillos have prehensile tails?"  He
was now enclosed in the tube.  "I'm giving you one last chance before I
retaliate."
	Robotnik walked over to the control panel.
	"Computer, throw the roboticizer boot-up program into an infinite loop."
His computer inserted the necessary code.  "And computer, retrieve the
location of Knothole from Packbell, then delete it from his memory."
	Robotnik hit a button and the sound of the roboticizer warming up filled
the room.  But it kept warming, the beam never kicked in.
	"I'd say we've thirty or so seconds before the entire room blows up,"
approximated Williams.
	"I would get you for this," said Robotnik, "but you saved me the trouble.
Packbell, lock the hedgehog in the room."
	Robotnik and the Swat-bots left the room.  Packbell, still carrying Sonic,
stepped outside, threw Sonic back in, and closed the only door to the room.
	Sonic looked at Williams and, albeit he gave Robotnik the only power ring
Sonic had with him, he did save Tails.
	"Stand back!" he said and tried to buzz-saw his way through the glass.
Not even a scratch.
	"Computer, raise the diamond-glass tube."  It retracted back into the
ceiling.  "Computer, how much time until the roboticizer overheats?"
	"Forty-two seconds," his computer reported.
	"We have more time than I thought."
	"Let's go!" urged Sonic.  "We're going to be toast!"
	"Relax.  We have more than an ample amount of time."
	Sonic tapped his foot on the ground as he waited.  Two seconds later,
"Time's up, let's go!"
	"Don't you want to wait until the last second and escape just in time?
Maybe dive behind something just as it's exploding?"
	"I'm not leaving without you!"
	"Okay.  Computer, take the roboticizer out of the loop."
	The roboticizer stopped warming up and engaged the beam.  Of course,
nobody was underneath it.
	"You could've done that all along?" asked Sonic.
	"Uh, huh," nodded Williams.
	"Let's go.  Through this vent."  Sonic lead the way out of the building.
	Williams was in for a pleasant surprise.  "Rain!  I love the rain!"  He
started to walk away.  "Bye!"
	Sonic caught up with him.  "Where are you going?"
	"To the Great Swamp."
	"In the rain!?!  I'll take you there."  He picked Williams up and they
were headed to the Great Swamp.  Williams gave directions as they went and
they soon arrived at a small village.
	"Thank you, you may go now."
	"You're going to stay here?"
	"Yes.  This is where I live.  Bye."
	Sonic was hesitant, but said his good-bye and left.

	The next day, there were still clouds overhead, but it seemed to be
clearing up.  Life in Knothole was returning to normal, but many villagers
still talked about Williams.  Tails and Dulcy were playing air tag.  Sally
was in her hut "recovering" as a messenger bird perched on her window sill.
She took the note from it and it flew away.  On it was written:

	To: Tails (No Pun Intended)

	"Tails!" Sally called out the window.
	Tails flew down and entered her hut.  "What is it, Aunt Sally?"
	"You have...mail."
	"Cool!"  Tails had never gotten mail before.  He opened it up.  There was
a small disc tied to the bottom of the note.  It read:

	Dear Tails,
		I thought you might like some information on the retrieval of data from
	other computers without direct links.  You wanted to know how I scrambled
	that Swat-bot, this will get you started.  Enclosed is a disc with
	everything on it.

	Tails untied the disc and asked Sally to borrow Nicole.  She let him, so
he inserted the disc and accessed what was on it.  A list of all the files
came up with a message at the bottom:

	P.S.  You now have a virus.



	The End...



	And now the character profile.

Name: Gabriel Williams
Species: Giant pangolin
Sex: Male
Age: 22
War Standing: Impartial observer
Occupation: Freelance hacker
Specialties: Computers and everything about them
Other Notes: Gabriel was originally born and raised in Mobitropolis, but was
	relocated to a village near the great swamp when Robotnik took over.  He
	can make the best out of any situation and always stays calm, even when he
	has no idea what's going on.  A few of his friends have been known to call
	him Xero at times, supposedly because of his sense of humor.  He uses this
	name when he doesn't want anybody to know his real one.  He doesn't really
	care who wins the war and has been trying not to get involved.  But since
	he's been dragged into the war, he'll fight for whichever side he wants
	and change sides a few times to make it interesting.  Gabriel has a
	computer, about the size of Nicole, as his aide.  If ever it was taken
	from him, he'd have only his wits to get it back or make a new one.

I think you mean 'intelligent'.  (:3  But that's a nitpick, as is my 
comment that you need to format for a few characters less across (the 
ends of some lines wrapped oddly).  Mainly I'm looking forward to seeing 
more!  (:3

Hello.

Today I got an interesting e-mail from Wallis@segaoa.com:

That means no more Sonic for the Genesis... what do you think about it?

Very disappointed

I _did not_ send this postings again. I really don't know how this could  
happen... There WERE some technical difficulties with my mailserver and  
some of my mail to the list got lost. But an accidential resend due to  
this problem is impossible because my program deletes all outgoing mail  
once it has been sent.

Take it easy... but take it

WHAT A STORY!!! I really liked the ending. So touching, it was worth the wait.
and now robin hood (Forget your name) Will be writing storys. This is almost as
good as having the sat AM show on with some storys that are better then some of
them (I think all the storys are better then the 4 15 min storys with ant.)
Anyway, I just wish I could write 1/4 as good as some of your guys. Keep up the
great work.

As the blue one once put it, "Does lightning fork?"

I was sort of reserving judgment until he'd gotten a body of work
printed, but #22 confirms it for me: Pat Spaziante is a major talent.  I
was particularly impressed by the very first panel of "The Return, part
1."  Very strong composition, though I wish Scott Fulop's text box
hadn't been placed so as to partially obscure the pose of *petite*
Sally.

I also think that windswept is a good look for Sally...

but, hey, Don't go changin', To try and please meeee...

BTW, Bunnie was conspicuous by her absence from "The Return."  Her
drooling fanboys are probably interested in Spaziante's rendering of
her.

Well, in "The Return" (Sonic #22) there is an offhand reference to "King
Sonic" on page 3.  Could it be?  Only if Mobian laws of succession are
more liberal than British peerage.

Under the British system, Elizabeth II should have named Princess Anne
as "Princess Royal" -- the female equivalent of the Prince of Wales and
Earl of Chester, i.e., the heir-apparent.  I guess with three sons
(Charles, Andrew and Edward), there's little chance of that happening.
Sally has consistently been called "Princess" but she probably wouldn't
have been named "Princess Royal" until she came of age, much as Charles
wasn't named Prince of Wales until he turned 21 in 1969, though he was
DECLARED Prince of Wales in 1958 at age 10.

So if that were out of the way, does that pave Sonic's way to the throne
of Mobius?  Not so fast: under British peerage, while the wives of
princes are automatically royal, the husbands of royalty can only
receive a courtesy title.  It wasn't until after ten years of marriage
that Elizabeth's husband, Philip, was named Prince of the United
Kingdom (note: not KING by any means).  He was made Duke of Edinburgh,
Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich on the eve of his wedding to
Elizabeth.

Does that make Sonic a freeloader?  Well, I figure that with Robotnik
out of the way and all righted on Mobius, as in the end of "Sally's
Quest," they'd probably find room to slap a title on the hedgehog.  I
propose: First Lord of the House of Ring [heraldic device: a gloved hand
holding a golden ring].  Sounds decent.

If you ask me, and I hope I don't offend the British, but ...

That sounds like a very sexist tradition.
In England, a man is only given a courtesy title while a woman is given 
full royalty, why?  My guess is that originally, the thinking went 
something like this . . .The man is the ruler of a country so, if he's 
not good enough to have been born into royalty in the first place, he 
certainly has no right to be King.(Even if he is qualified).  The woman, 
on the other hand, while she may not be royalty, she has the ability to 
give birth to children that will be royalty, so she should be given 
royalty so that the children can have it too.
(I should think Mobius would be a little more enlightened than that.)

Thts probably not to accurate, but it's the best I can do.

In the meantime, here another royal mind-bender for you to mull over . . .

Everyone knows that Sonic and Sally are going to be married one day.  
This means that Sonic will be the next ruler of Mobius.  So, what kind of 
ruler would he be?  Does he have the right qualifications?

You tell me.

Long Live KING Sonic the First, and God save us all if Sally decides to 
marry Antoine instead!!!!!!!!

Again, it depends on how they handle succession on Mobius.  Sonic &
Sally may be an item, but Sonic may end up being the Royal Consort --
sort of the male First Lady.  Just as well; I get a sense that Sonic
would get bored with the technicalities of statecraft rather quickly.

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 5



     Silently, the two sisters walked past the curious crowds of
freedom fighters who had gathered about the hut.  "Please," Sally
said to them, "this is something we have to do alone.  You
understand."  The freedom fighters murmurred in assent and let
them pass.
     Sally led her sister, in silence, to a small clearing.  Just
beyond, barely visible through the brush, was a pool of water. 
Beneath this was the source of the power rings that gave Sonic
the added velocity he needed at times.
     But that was the farthest thing from the minds of the two
sisters as they entered the clearing.  Before them was a mound of
earth, at one end of which a simple stone of memory had been
placed.  It was the only such mound in the clearing.
     "My mentor, Julayla," Sally said simply.  "She was a good
teacher; I didn't appreciate until much later that she was also a
good friend."
     "You were right, this *is* a good place.  We'd better
begin."
     The two began tearing at the grass, uprooting it and
removing dirt by the handfulls.  As they worked, they talked.
     "Did Mother ever say why we were split up, Sandy?"
     "It wasn't her idea, or Father's from what she could tell. 
He was talked into it by Karack, governor of the Southern
Provinces.  He was that 'swine' that Rosie mentioned.  Because
the South took so much punishment during the Great War, leaving
Mobotropolis relatively untouched for most of the fighting, and
because Karack passed himself off as a militarty genius, Father
apparently trusted his judgment.  Maybe if Father had been more
of a skeptic all this never would have happened.
     "Anyway, Karack reasoned with Father that the royal family
needed to be split up for 'security reasons.'  He must have
convinced Father that, if the royal family stayed together, we
could all be wiped out in a single attack.  So Father approved of
the plan.
     "At first, Mother told me, it wasn't such a hardship to be
separated from Father.  I suppose looking after an infant took
much of her time.  But she said she also wrote many letters to
Father.  I don't think any of them ever reached Father, or if
they did, they were altered to say what Karack wanted them to
say.
     "So long as Karack could present himself as a successful
governor in a combat zone, he had Father's ear.  That made it all
the easier when Karack brought his protege to court with a
petition that he be installed in the War Ministry: Julian."
     "So this Karack and Robotnik were on the same side all
along?"
     "Apparently.  It's hard to say who thought he was in control
of whom.  Karack must have been sure he had Julian on a short
leash; we've seen what Julian was capable of doing.
     "I was four years old when the experiments began.  Mother
began to be sick a lot; I'm not certain but I think Julian was
arranging to have someone taint her food so she'd have to be
taken someplace for treatments.  All I knew was that someone
would come to take her away, they'd lock me in my room, and
nobody would let me out no matter how much I pounded on the door
or screamed.  Only when she was back in her room would they let
me out."
     "You sound as if you were being held prisoner."
     "We were; there's no other way to explain it."
     "And Father never suspected anything?"
     "Apparently not; Karack must have let a couple of letters
get through--enough to put his mind at ease.  So he had no way of
knowing what was happening to us.
     "One day, Mother was brought back in and I was let into her
room.  She was unconscious, and when I tried to move her, the
covering slipped off her bed, where she'd been placed.  I...I
can't begin to describe what I felt when I saw what they'd done
to her left foot.  I thought they'd chopped off her real one and
put a metal one in its place.  I was panicked and screaming when
two bots came into the room.  They took me to a laboratory of
some sort.  After that everything was a blur except for
Julian...and that look on his face!  I woke up back in the room
where Mother and I were being held.  My right hand had been
roboticized.  The forearm and upper arm came later on two
different occasions.
     "From that time on we were treated as prisoners, without
even the pretense of civilized treatment.  From our window we
could see shipments of bots coming in, as Julian prepared for
some kind of assault.
     "Then the day came when Julian had us brought to the throne
room.  He said he was going to 'tie together some loose ends.' 
The first one he took care of was Karack."
     "Let me guess: Robotnik had him roboticized."
     "Robotnik knew all along what kind of petty opportunist he
was up against in Karack.  He would have done Karack a favor by
roboticizing him.  After he was done, Robotnik didn't leave
enough of Karack to pour into one of your boots.  He made Mother
and I watch what happened--I still wake up screaming sometimes,
thinking about it.  Then he ordered us returned to our room."
     "So how did you ever escape?"
     "It wasn't easy.  We were under surveillance every minute of
every day.  Ironically, it was Robotnik who made our escape
possible.
     "The residents of the capitol thought they were safe because
of Karack's dealings with Robotnik, but they were wrong.  With
Karack out of the way, Robotnik had no more use for the city.  He
brought in SWAT-bots and began destroying the whole place.
     "I don't have any clear memories of what happened, but
Mother told me that we were being escorted down a hallway by a
couple of Karack's guards when the palace was rocked by some kind
of explosion--we could never learn exactly what had happened. 
Anyway, in that one moment, the guards panicked and fled, more
worried about saving their own lives than watching us.  That was
all the chance Mother needed.
     "Mother had been born in the Southern Provinces and had
wintered in the palace as a child.  So she knew every inch of the
place, including tunnels and passages nobody was supposed to know
about. She opened one of these and we went inside.  That was the
first time I heard the sound of SWAT-bots.  They were coming down
the hallway, then I could hear the sound of their footsteps
fading as they headed off in the direction of our room.  I'm sure
they were under orders to execute us.
     "We moved along the corridor.  It was darker than night in
there, but Mother held me and whispered that I should be very
quiet.  I could only feel myself being carried onward and
downward, down what felt like a descending pathway.
     "No sooner had we reached what felt like the botton of the
path and a stretch of level tunnel than the ground above us
began shaking violently.  I remember screaming, then dirt raining
down on top of me.  Next thing I knew, I was outside of the city,
in the moonlight.
     "Mother told me later what had happened: bombs had been
placed in select areas of the city and the palace, with the
military bots--now called SWATbots--holding the people captive in
several predetermined locations.  Robotnik apparently got away
after giving the order for the SWATbots to detonate the bombs. 
That's how the palace, the capitol and the people were destroyed. 
It didn't matter to Robotnik that he lost a number of his
SWATbots--maybe he thought it would look more like a military
strike that way.  Maybe half a dozen Mobians survived the blast
through some twist of fate or other.  Mother and I survived only
because we were underground.
     "We came up through an opening that led to the outskirts of
the city; the city itself appeared to be deserted except for the
bodies.  We were too much in shock at the time to know what to do
or where to go.  We found a house that was still relatively
intact and fell asleep.  
     "The next morning we woke to find ourselves surrounded by
Nomads--apparently they'd come to scavenge the city or what was
left of it.  Because Mother still had some of her jewels with
her, including a brooch studded with gems that was a wedding
present from Father--that's the one I gave Bunnie to show to 
you--and because Mother knew a great deal about the Nomads'
language and customs, we bargained our way onto the caravan.  And
we travelled with the Nomads from that day forward, hiding our
identities when SWATbot patrols came around.  When we heard that
Mobotropolis had been taken and the populace roboticized, it
seemed pointless to go back anyway.  We got used to that life,
but it cost us dearly: we lost all hope that things would ever be
as they were.  And then we ran into Dirk and heard about you.
     "I think that's it," she said as she wiped the dirt from her
hands.
     "So do I.  Let's go."
     Sally and Sandy left the clearing, their task accomplished. 
Sally still had hopes that Uncle Chuck might find a way to
miraculously cure their mother.  In the meantime, they had acted
in accordance with Mobian custom: they had, with their bare
hands, dug their mother's grave.
     They returned to Knothole just as Uncle Chuck stepped out of
Sally's hut.  Sally, despite the physical and emotional
exhaustion she felt, ran toward him.
     "Any news, Uncle Chuck?"
     "Yes, but I'm afraid it's not good."

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 6

     Sandy and Sally followed Uncle Chuck into the hut.  Sonic
and Bunnie were inside already, and Rotor and Antoine were busy
bringing items into the hut from the porch.  A small mountain of
flowers was growing near the foot of the bed.
     "It was Bunnie's idea," Uncle Chuck said.  "Now that we have
a better idea of what's happening to your mother, Bunnie thought
she might appreciate seeing some of the things left for her." 
Indeed, Queen Alicia, though still weak and pale, was genuinely
touched by the tributes left for her.
     "What IS happening to her, Uncle Chuck?" Sally asked.  Uncle
Chuck paused.
     "Before I explain, you have to understand I only invented
the roboticizer to enable older folks to live longer lives; I
certainly never meant for them to cheat death."
     "What does that have to do with it?" Sandy asked
impatiently.
     "I actually had the basic process worked out a year before I
finally rejected it--and a year before Robotnik began using it
for his own purposes.  I spent almost that whole year working on
one aspect of the process: bioscreening."
     "Bioscreening?"  Sally asked.  "What's that?"
     "A roboticized body isn't entirely mechanical.  What the
roboticization process does is to reconstruct mechanical analogs
to some of the failed body systems, such as wasted limbs, and use
other systems that are still functioning without replacing them. 
The heart continues to function, serving as an electric motor
once it's been adapted; the brain continues to function as well,
though it appears that the penetration of the brain by the
mechanical components had a lot to do with destroying a person's
will.  That's why I ultimately gave up on the notion of
roboticization.
     "But the body of someone who's been roboticized becomes like
any other machine: it performs mechanical functions and those
functions produce waste products.  I found that the early
roboticizing process produced many unwanted elements, and unless
they were dealt with...."
     "Unless they were dealt with," Rotor spoke up, "they'd have
nowhere to go except back into the body!"
     "That's right.   And...and that's what's killing the Queen."
     It suddenly became very quiet inside the hut.
     "Robotnik must have used an earlier version of the process;
either that, or he simply removed the bioscreening capabilities
from a later design.  Either way,..."
     "Never mind all that!" Sandy snapped.  "Exactly what's
killing our mother?"
     "It's...there are so many things," Uncle Chuck sighed. 
"She's suffering from irregular heart rhythms caused by
electrical interference, her lungs are full of tumors caused by
toxins, her liver has been poisoned by heavy metals...there's
just too much...."
     Sandy turned on her heels, hurled a chair across the hut,
and before the last splinter fell to the floor she was gone. 
Sally rose to follow her.
     "Better let her be, Sally girl," Bunnie said softly.
     "You stay, too, Bunnie.  This is your problem as well." 
Uncle Chuck's words rooted Bunnie to the spot.  
     "You and Sandy are in the same position as the Queen, though
not to the same extent.  The blood samples I took from both of
you confirm it: you're being affected by the same thing that's
affecting the Queen."
     "Is there a..." Bunnie started to ask.
     "A cure?  If caught early enough, yes.  The technology to
detoxify your body is readily available.  Unfortunately, so long
as you're part-robot, you'll only wind up 're-infecting'
yourself, as it were.  Unless you were deroboticized, it would
only be a matter of time before your body started breaking down
from the stress."
     "And Mother?" Sally asked.  Uncle Chuck shook his head
slightly.
     "Uncle Chuck," Sonic asked, "are you saying that anyone
who's been roboticized is going to go through this?"
     "That's about the size of it, Sonic."
     "No way!  I mean, YOU were roboticized yourself and you're
not...."
     Whatever else Sonic had to say died on his lips.  Uncle
Chuck looked at his nephew with robotic eyes, eyes that still
showed a great deal of pain.
     "Sonie, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't fully
understand what was going on and I didn't want to scare you, but
I've felt myself starting to slow down lately.  Not a lot, but
enough to notice.  At first I thought it was just my age catching
up to me, but...."
     "No!"
     "Sonie, listen to me!  I had Nicole run a model of the
progression of this...this disease or whatever you want to call
it.  Based on what she said, and after analyzing my own blood
sample, I've still got about three more good years left in me
before...."
     "Oh, Uncle Chuck, no," Sally whispered.  She walked up to
him and put her arms around him.  Then she asked, "What about the
others?"
     "Nicole estimates that within five years..."  He couldn't
finish the sentence.  Rotor grabbed a chair and Uncle Chuck sat
down heavily.  "Within five years, anywhere from a third to one
half of the roboticized Mobians will be dead or dying.  Inside of
ten years, nobody who was fully roboticized will be left."  The
silence in the hut deepened.
     "What have I done?" Uncle Chuck wailed, burying his face in
his hands, "what have I done?"
     It was the faintest of whispers that caught his attention. 
The Queen was calling his name.  He approached Queen Alicia and
knelt next to her bed.  The Queen placed her hand on his own.
     "It's not...your fault.  This...is Julian's evil.  It is
not...your fault."
     Bunnie turned and left the hut in a daze.  She wandered out
toward the river that ran next to Knothole, and the bridge that
spanned it.  She could see someone standing at the middle of the
bridge, looking down at the flowing water.  It was Sandy.  Bunnie
walked over to her.
     "You OK, Sandy?" she asked.  Sandy didn't say anything for a
minute, until she drew back her cloak.
     "You see this scar tissue, just where the robot arm ends?"
     "Uh huh."
     "One day, when I must have been about eight years old, I
felt that the Nomad children had called me 'monster hand' for the
last time.  I snuck a knife out of one of the tents, took it with
me to a secluded spot, and started cutting my arm off.  I bit my
lip raw trying not to scream out from the pain.  I never finished
the job; I passed out from loss of blood, and that's how they
found me.  They told me I almost died that day; I told them I
wished I had."
     She turned.  "Bunnie, I don't know how you manage to keep
from killing yourself."
     Bunnie didn't answer, because she didn't have an answer. 
Mercifully, she was spared from having to answer the question,
for Tails walked up to her.  He looked unusually sullen.
     "Somethin' the matter, honey?" Bunnie asked.
     "I just don't know why everyone's acting so strange, Aunt
Bunnie.  I mean, I know that it's sad that the Queen's gonna die,
but how come everybody's so weirded out about it?  It's...."
     "Scary, right?"
     "Yeah," he said in a near-whisper, glad that someone else
could talk about the feeling he wasn't about to admit himself.
     Bunnie thought for a few seconds.  "Maybe Ah can explain it.
You remember what happened last winter, when Sonic had to stay
with Antoine until he could get his place rebuilt after Dulcy
landed on it?"
     "Yeah!" Tails laughed.  "Antoine really got bent out of
shape!  You could hear him yelling at Sonic all over Knothole."
     "That's 'cuz Antoine got used to livin' a certain way, and
when he had to get used to Sonic's way of livin', he couldn't
handle it."
     "But what's that got to do with the way everyone's been
acting?"
     "Well, honey, we all of us get used to life, and when we're
reminded that we're all gonna have to stop livin' one day, then
it's our turn to get bent out of shape.  See what Ah mean?"
     "I think so.  Thanks, Aunt Bunnie."  He smiled, kissed
Bunnie on the cheek, and was off.
     "Why 'Aunt Bunnie?'" Sandy asked.
     "Oh, that's jes' what he calls me, same as he calls Sally
'Aunt Sally.'"  Bunnie paused.  "Y'know, Sandy, that may be the
answer to your question."
     "What is?"
     "Well, you can see we're not like any fancy kinda army here.
It feels more like...like a family.  After all, we all lost our
real families when Robotnik took over and roboticized 'em.  We
don't have any kin of our own left, so we have to be kin to each
other.  Ah think that's what keeps us going."
     "I see.  Well, maybe I'll find something to keep *me*
going."
     "Ah hope so."
     "You'll excuse me, I'm going for a walk."
     Sandy walked to the end of the bridge, then turned and began
walking along the bank of the river.  She studied the bank
intently, as if looking for something.  Occasionally she would
reach into the water and pull out a small stone from the river
bed.  The first few stones she tossed back into the water. 
Finally, she found one that suited some purpose of hers.  Sitting
on the riverbank, she pulled out her knife and slowly and
methodically began running the stone against the blade.  She
didn't stop until the blade was as sharp as a scalpel.

Hi Erich:

I understand your concern.  For those who may not know, I am Paul Castiglia.
 I work for Archie Comics.  I am a former editor of Sonic The Hedgehog comics
and I have written some back-up Sonic stories which will appear soon.  Anyone
with questions, please feel free to ask and I will attempt to answer them or
pass them along to current Sonic editor, Scott Fulop.  Recently, we added
dynamic new artist Patrick Spaziante to the Sonic team.  We would be
interested to hear how you feel about Patrick's work.

Regards, Paul "Benny7dude" Castiglia

I had to recheck my copy to see what you were talking about - hmm, _I_ 
hadn't noticed the placement of that panel... :^)  But there were a few 
full frontal shots later in the issue...

I definitely like his Sally, but it's a toss-up with Art Mawhinney as to 
who I like better.  However, I think I like Art's Sonic better (and also 
Dave Manak's for that matter) - I can't put my finger on what I don't like 
about Pat's Sonic - I think it's the way his quills are drawn, or maybe his 
eyes, or...

>BTW, Bunnie was conspicuous by her absence from "The Return."  Her

Well, yeah :^)  For that matter, I don't think we've seen Art's version 
either, except on the splash page to Princess Sally #1.  

And to drag this back to the subject, I checked the credits of Doomsday and 
Shaw! isn't listed - I know he's done work on Garfield & Friends, but I 
don't know what else...

Unfortunely, the name Scott Shaw! (complete with explanation mark) is 
found in the end credits of that disgrace to the Sonic legend, the 
syndicated Sonic Series.  Othere than that, I can't remember if I've seen 
his name in the credits of Camp Candy or not.

Scott Shaw! Worked on about a gazillion 1970's and '80's Hanna-Barbera
animated series, including Camp Candy, Ed Grimley and (to this day) the
Flinstones Fruity Pebbles commercials.  Scott has drawn comic books featuring
many animation characters, including Hanna-Barbera characters.  Scott has
also done many underground comics, and he was the co-creator and main
penciller on DC Comics' "Capt. Carrot & The Zoo Crew."  Scott has also
 released an "Oddball Comics" trading card set, featuring some of the
wackiest comic book covers ever published (there were so many comic
publishers in the '40s and '50s that a slew of inane and ridiculous material
was published).  This card set was based on his ever-popular annual slide
show presentation at the San Diego Convention.  Scott is a respected member
of the animation and comic book communities.

Yeah, well, I needed something to do that first week before the Saturday 
Sonic premired.  Beside, the first few shows weren't *that* bad, but it 
went down hill from there.  Still, there were some good looking females in 
that series . . .

Without access to the DiC script for "Cry of the Wolf":

My gut reaction is to spell it "Lupe" with a grave accent over the final
"e".  Since this does not exist in ASCII, and cyberspace at present is
hostile to everything but, I've copped out in the FAQ file and spelled
it "Lupee."

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

I did take French years ago.  Not exactly Latin, but French developed 
from Latin.  Going back to what I remember from French class, I think the 
acute accent (') is more appropriate than the grave accent (`).  And if 
you write "Lupee" in French, you must put an acute accent over one e 
(most likely the first one).

I think the name was intended to represent the Latin form rather than the 
French, and I don't know the rules for Latin.  Has anyone else here taken 
Latin?

Hi, gang:

Paul Castiglia from Archie Comics, here.  After seeing all the comments
abiout our Sonic comic, it got me thinking: what if we started a special
sub-section on our "Sonic Grams" letter page designated, "Notes From The
Net."  We would print your comments and your e-mail address on the Sonic
letters page, so if others wanted to converse with you via e-mail, they
could-- and to encourage people to join this newsgroup.  Let me know what
you think of this idea.  If enough people respond favorably, we'll
institute it.  From then on, if you send a comment about our comics,
please preface it with the heading, *********NOT FOR NOTES FROM THE
NET**********if you don't want it published; and *********FOR NOTES FROM
THE NET******** if you do....

   I just realized, after writing my last story, that I "wrote myself into a
corner," so to speak. "Pangolin Problems" takes place just before the last
"Sonic the Hedgehog" episode of the second season.  This leaves no room for
another story.  My only choice was to write something that comes before or
after it.  I dare not write anything that I don't know about.  If I had
written a post-Doomsday story, Murphy's Law dictates that Archie would
release an issue that contradicts everything that I wrote.  So here's my
latest story, a kind of prologue.  Keep in mind that this story takes place
two years before my last one and all the characters were roboticized.  (Or
not...)
Anyways, enjoy.

                              by Michael Szal                              
                              (bblaze@aol.com)                              



   "Every time I try to get rid of that hedgehog," lectured Robotnik, "EVERY
TIME, Snively, he finds a way out of it!  Well NOT this time!  THIS time he
is mine!"  Robotnik held up a small test tube of a clear liquid.  "See this,
Snively?  This is the key to success!  It's too bad, though.  I always hoped
to roboticize the little rodent.  This will have to do."
   In his hand, Robotnik held a few nanites, microscopic robots literally
build atom by atom.  They could infect a living being with ease, then it's
just a matter of self-replication until there are enough of them to kill
their host off.  All he had to do was release them into the atmosphere.  If
one nanite can replicate itself in a fifteen minutes, it can produce a
population of eight hundred trillion hundred trillion nanites (1 blossoms
into 79,228,162,514,300,000,000,000,000,000) in a single day, considering
that each nanite built can build more.  There are more than enough raw
materials to build these replicated nanites from, the dirt.
   Robotnik's nanites had but two functions, reproduce and infect any living
thing that was not him or Snively.  Once inside a being, the nanites would
simply attack the body, which would try to defend itself from this foreign
invasion.  To the host, it would feel exactly like they had the flu, a
fever, loss of energy, only once infected, there was no cure--they were
going to die.

   It was hardly a typical day for the inhabitants of Knothole villiage--if
there is a "typical" day.  It seems like there's always something happening.
But not today, nothing was happening today.  Nobody was going after
Robotnik, nobody was testing new inventions, nobody was practicing their
martial arts, nobody was cooking.  Absolute zero.
   It was still pretty cold outside, a thin layer of snow covered most of
the ground.  Patches of grass could be seen here and there.  It was that
time when it was too cold to go outside, but there wasn't enough snow to do
anything even if you wanted to go outside.  Everybody was stuck in their
huts until the weather got better.
   Antoine was the only one who kept busy.  He was polishing his boots--for
the fourth time.  That was the only thing left for him to do, his room was
perfect in every detail.  After he finished, he sat down on his couch.
Almost immediately, he realized what he had done.  He stood up, brushed off
the couch, and fixed the pillows.  Then he started to polish his boots
again.
   Sonic paced around his hut.  He was getting extremely impatient.  There
was just too much energy locked up inside him.  Every once in a while, he'd
stop, look around the hut for something to do, find nothing, and continue
pacing.  There was nothing left to do.  This was one of the few times that
he actually hoped Robotnik was up to something.
   Dulcy was probably worse off than the rest.  She was a dragon, she was
supposed to fly.  But it was freezing!  And where would she go?  She was
bored and frustrated at the same time.  She sighed, got up out of bed, and
looked out the window.  She could see Sonic pacing around his hut.
   Bunny sat and read.  She had already read this book, but at least it was
something to do.  Tomorrow she'd be finished and reading another book she
already read.  Every few chapters, she'd find herself thinking of Rotor, but
that's another story.
   Rotor could not be more bored.  He had "inventor's block."  There was
nothing to invent, and nothing to fix.  There wasn't even something to
improve upon.  He looked around his lab, straining to find something to do,
but failed.  He secretly wished that something would go wrong with one of
Bunny's robotic limbs.
   Bookshire wasn't THAT bored.  He was used to staying at Knothole.
Because of his leg, he was in no condition to go on a mission to
Robotropolis.  Even so, most of the time he was able to help his friends by
remote communication.  The only thing he could do now was monitor the
Robotropolis Main Computer Core to see what was up.
   Tails stared out the window, not looking at anything in particular.  He
was lost in thought and would only snap out of it when the window got fogged
up because of his getting too close to it.  He'd try to think of something
to do when his thoughts would wander and the next he knew, he couldn't see
out the window.  He sat down on his bed and stared at the ceiling, letting
his thoughts wander from there.  There just wasn't anything to do!  He got
up and paced around the room, but soon found himself back at the window.
   Princess Sally was in the room with him, keeping an eye on him.  There
was no reason to do so.  The only way Tails could possibly hurt himself is
by cutting himself on a piece of glass as he tried to escape this insanely
boring situation.  She looked down at Nicole, then at Tails, then at some
books.  She was just about to offer to read a story to Tails when she
remembered that they had all been read.
   The last two days were spent like this, nothing to do but trying to find
something to do, until one day, Sonic got sick.  It wasn't unusual at the
time, even speedy hedgehogs get sick once in a while.  Besides, it was cold
out.  Sally attended to him and everything was back to normal.
   Later that same day, Sally got sick.  Dulcy also.  Sally first thought
that she had caught Sonic's illness, probably just a cold, but symptoms in
a matter of hours?  And what about Dulcy?  She was in her hut all this time,
no where near Sonic.  Sally decided to consult Bookshire.
   "It's probably just a coincidence," explained Bookshire.  "But if it
makes you feel better, I'll investigate.  You say Sonic got sick this
afternoon?"
   "Yes.  He came into my hut complaining about a fever.  I took him back
to his hut and took his temperature.  Nicole reported a mild one, nothing
to be worried about.  I asked Antoine to cook up some soup and gave it to
Sonic.  He said he'd be fine, so I left."
   "And now you're sick?"
   She nodded.
   "Same symptoms?  Mild temperature?"
   Nodded again.  "A little lower than Sonic's but I'm sure that's just
because I took it early."
   "It sounds to me like the flu, but let's check on Sonic."

   "Gaaaaabriel!" a voice called from somewhere outside.  "Gaaaaabe!"  The
door burst open.  "I thought I'd find you in here," a young, female paca
came in.
   "My god, woman!" Williams exclaimed, getting out of his chair.  "Have you
gone crazy!?!  Close that door!"
   She fulfilled his request.  "Your room is always so messy," she said,
picking up a stack of books.
   "What are you doing now?  I've told you before, however 'messy' this room
gets, just leave it."  He didn't think his room was messy.  It wasn't
really, not to the point where cockroaches and rats scavenge for food left
on the floor.  It just had technical books and electronic parts strewn about
wherever there was room.  "I know exactly where everything is.  When you
move something, I won't be able to find it."
   She put the books back.  "What are you doing stuck in here, anyway?  You
should come outside.  It's a lovely day!"
   "It is not even close to being 'lovely' outside.  Computer, how cold is
it?"
   "Sixty-eight degrees," Williams' small computer reported.
   "No, computer, outside.  How cold is it outside?"
   "Forty degrees."
   "See?  It's ten--eight degrees above freezing.  Some animals can't
SURVIVE in this weather."  He sat back down.  "And it's Williams."
   "What is it about your first name that you don't like?  I like it."
   "It's not that I don't like it, it's just that the other guy is also
Gabriel."
   "Oh, the 'other guy.'"
   "You know who I'm talking about, the painter.  It's easier to
distinguish between the two of us if you call me Williams and him Gabriel."
   "Why don't I call him by his last name and you by your first?"
   "I don't know......  Just call me Williams, okay?"
   "Fine."
   "Painter," he said to himself.  "Robotnik beware!  We have a painter!"
   "Don't tease him like that.  I like his work."
   "And I respect your opinion, but if he's going to paint something, the
least he could do is make it look like what he's painting.  You're a nurse,
that's good, nurses are good.  I'm a programmer, that's good, programmers
are good.  He's a painter."
   She sat down on his bed, knowing the conversation was over.  "What are
you working on now?"
   "Ah!" he grinned and picked up his computer, forgetting all about the
painter.  "It's done!  I just need to perfect it, get rid of some bugs, but
it's done!"
   "What can you do now?"
   "I have remote access to other terminals."
   "You really ought to get out more."
   "I'll get out when it warms up, but until then, I'm staying right here."
   "Suit yourself."
   He sat down next to her.  "Listen Kristen," he said, and took her hand,
"Jeez!  You're burning up!"  He felt her forehead.  "You're staying right
here!  How can you NOT be cold?  I'll get the doctor."  He left the room.
   Williams had the "luck" of getting stuck with too many snobby, yet
intelligent people.  A Doctor, nurse, painter, psychologist, physicist,
chemist, biologist, mathematician, and he the lowly computer hacker.  Some
of the villagers looked down upon him, but others, like Kristen, have
learned to like him.
   He arrived at the doctor's hut (it was just across from his) and knocked
on the door.  "Helen!"  He knocked again.
   She opened the door.  "What is it, Gabriel?"
   "Williams.  Your daughter's sick."
   "Right, you prefer Williams.  I prefer being addressed as 'Mrs. Taylor.'"
They headed back to his hut.
   "Mother," said Kristen, "I'm fine.  I'll just drink more fluids and
everything will be okay."
   "You're going to need some antibiotics.  Take some of this," prescribed
Mrs. Taylor.  She took a small bottle out of a bag she brought from her hut
and poured some of the thick liquid into a cup.
   Kristen drank the foul-tasting liquid.
   "You'll be fine, just stay in bed and take your medicine.  Now let's go."
   Both the women left Williams to his debugging.
   "Mother!" scolded Kristen after they were both inside their hut.  "Please
don't act like that!"
   "Like what?"
   "Just because he didn't come from one of the richest families in
Mobitropolis doesn't mean you can treat him like that!  His parents were
roboticized, Mother!"
   "I don't want him to get involved in our lives."
   "As I remember it, we got involved in his.  He was one of the first ones
here, remember?  Besides, we don't have much of a choice.  It's a small
village and we're going to be here a while."

   "This is wonderful!  Don't you agree Snively?"
   "Yes, sir."  He didn't particularly like the idea of Robotnik and himself
being the only two living things on the entire planet.  But he couldn't do
anything about it.
   "In a few more days, the world will be mine!"

   "So you never went outside for the past few days?" questioned Bookshire.
   "Nope," answered Sonic.  "And I'm itchin' to get out!"
   "That's not very likely.  Your fever is getting worse.  I don't have much
but this should do for now."  He administered a dose of medicine to Sonic.
"Let's just hope nobody else gets sick."
   It seems they didn't hope enough.  By the next morning, almost everybody
in the village was sick.
   "I'm willing to believe it's more than the flu," said Bookshire, also
sick.
   "But what could spread this fast?"  Sally was feeling horrible, but she
HAD to know what was going on.  "And why isn't the medicine working?"
   "I'm not quite sure, could I borrow Nicole?"
   Sally gave her computer to Bookshire.
   "Nicole, analyze Sally's blood, scan for anything abnormal.
   "Foreign bodies found," reported Nicole.
   "Can you identify them?"
   "Yes.  They are nanites from the roboticizer."
   "Roboticizer?"  Sally was confused.
   "Apparently," explained Bookshire, "Robotnik reprogrammed his nanites to
infect us.  We're obviously not being roboticized."
   "How can we stop them?"
   "That's the hard part.  We'd have to build some kind of a antiroboticizer
that can get rid of them."
   "That could take days!?!"
   "More like months.  You just got sick fifteen hours ago.  Considering
your condition, I'd say nobody in this village will live longer than
another two days."
   Sally just looked at him, then began to cry.
   He held her head on his shoulder.  "It'll be okay.  We'll figure
something out."
   "What about Tails?" she sobbed.  "He's only eight years old!"
   "If you help me, we might be able to find some other way to 'cure' this."
   She continued to cry, but eventually calmed down.
   "Sally, I want you to get Rotor, he can help us, and whatever you do,
don't tell anybody.  The last thing we need is the entire, panicked village
on our hands."
   Sally left to go find Rotor and arrived with him a few minutes later.
   "Sally said you wanted to see me."
   "Do you know anything about nanites?"
   "A little.  Not enough to roboticize somebody."
   "How would you go about programming one?"
   "I guess it would have to be done chemically, they're too small for a
disc."
   "That's what I was afraid of.  We have a lot of work to do."
   The four of them worked as fast as they could,  trying to figure out the
nanites' technology.  Once they learned how to program it, it was a simple
matter of telling Nicole to deactivate them all.  But, alas, they worked
non-stop for the next thirty-seven hours to no avail.  They were all tired
and getting weaker by the minute (besides Nicole).
   "I'm sorry, Sally," Bookshire's voice was hoarse, "but there's nothing
more I can do."
   "If I'm going to die, there's some things I have to do first."  Sally
left.  It sounded like she finally accepted that she was going to die.
   "Anything you want to do, Rotor?"
   "Not enough time."  He kept working, but in the back of his mind he knew
that it didn't matter what he did.  The only reason he worked was to keep
his mind off impending death.
   Sally went to Sonic's hut.  She found him awake in his bed.  He turned to
look at her as she came in.  She walked over to Sonic, passionately kissed
him, and then left.
   Sonic sat there for a while, stunned, then confused.  "Sal must be
getting delirious," he thought to himself.
   Next, Sally visited Tails.  "Do you feel okay?" she asked.
   "Fine, Aunt Sally."  He could barely talk.
   "I'm sorry, Tails."  She sat down next to him on his bed.
   "Why?"
   "I couldn't find the cure in time."
   "You did your best."
   "I know, but it's not fair.  It's just not fair."

   Williams was one of the last to get sick.  He realized the medicine Mrs.
Taylor gave everybody was not working at all.  "Computer, what illness do I
have?"
   "None."
   "Another bug," he said to himself.  "Computer, what is wrong with me?"
   "Nothing."
   "Computer, there is something in my body making me sick, what is it?"
   "They are Nanites."
   "Nanites?  That's all?  Computer, what are they programmed to do?"
   "Unknown."
   "Oh, yeah.  They don't run on electrical impulses.  Okay, here."  He slid
open a small slot on the side of his computer and put a drop of his blood on
it, then pushed it back in.  "Computer, pick a nanite, any nanite, and find
out how it works.  Tell me when you're done."  He waited for a while.
"Computer, how long is this going to take?"
   "Approximately three hours."
   Williams groaned.  But sure enough, three hours later his computer had
learned to control a nanite.
   "Computer, what are the nanites programmed to do?"
   "They are programmed to infect any living thing except two select
individuals, then kill their host."
   "Who are the two individuals that they won't infect?"
   "DNA unknown."
   "Probably Robotnik and Snively.  Now, computer, pick any ten nanites and
have them deactivate themselves.  But before they deactivate, have them
pick ten nanites each and tell the nanites they picked to do the same."
   In one or two seconds, depending on how many nanites there were, they
were all deactivated.  It was a simple as that.  Everybody infected would
slowly get better.  The nanites weren't killing them anymore and that gave
their bodies a chance to heal.  The "dead" nanites would soon leave the
body, through one of various ways.  But Williams had bigger ideas.

   The citizens of Knothole slowly began to feel better and better.  Nobody
knew exactly what had happened, but they were alive and that was all that
mattered.
   Sonic saw Sally on her way to Bookshire's hut and ran up next to her.
"So Sal..." he said, smiling.
   "I don't want to talk about it, Sonic Hedgehog.  I was going to die, it
was a spontaneous thing."
   "Right, Sal.  Whatever you say."
   "It was!  I just--  This conversation is over."  She opened the door to
Bookshire's hut.
   "Sally, It's good to see you again.  You should be dead."
   "Where's Rotor?  I came to thank both of you.  What did you two do?"
   "Nothing.  I was supposed to be dead also."
   "Wait......  You're saying the nanites just gave up?"
   "Yes, and let's hope it stays like that."
   It puzzled both of them.  The nanites had them licked, why did they give
up?  Sally didn't think about it any more, she was just glad it was over.

   Williams walked over to Kristen's hut with a vial of some clear liquid.
He knocked on the door and patiently waited for her to answer.  Mrs. Taylor
answered instead.
   "What do you want?"
   "I brought a gift for your wonderful daughter," he said, holding up the
vial.
   "Water?"
   "Well......yeah."
   "Kristen!" she called.  "Your little 'friend' has brought you some
water!"  She went back inside.
   Kristen came out.
   "Feeling better?" asked Williams.
   "Yes, I guess so."
   Williams explained why.  He had proof if he needed it, but Kristen
believed him.
   "You have to tell everybody!"  She was very excited.
   "I will, later.  But first, I brought you this."  He handed her the vial
of water.  "Drink it."
   She smelt it and looked at him as if it was some sort of poison.
   "Go ahead, drink it."
   She did, but nothing happened.  It tasted exactly like water.  She didn't
feel any different.
   "You are now immune to about ninety-nine point nine percent of all
diseases and your mother is out of a job."
   She looked at him in disbelief.
   "I'm serious.  You just drank about a thousand nanites.  Now that they're
inside your body, they'll replicate themselves until a stable population
is reached and keep you healthy.  They'll even slow your growing old.  Not
by much, though, I'm still working on that."
   "That's great!"  She kissed him on the cheek.
   "Yeah...well..."
   "You should give some to everyone."
   "Uh, no.  Only a select few get the nanites."
   "Who have you 'chosen?'"
   "The only person I can trust.  Nanites are a curse as well as a blessing.
Whoever controls the nanites, controls the person they inhabit.  I could
kill you right now."
   She looked at him, surprised at what he just said.
   "You know me better than that.  Anyway, the only person I can trust here
is Adam."
   "You TRUST him?"
   "He may be unpredictable and he may have locked me out of my computer a
few times, but he knows what he's doing.  I trust him."
   "Then why did you give the nanites to me?"
   "Because you're my friend and everybody knows that scientists give their
discoveries to their friends before releasing them to the general public.
So, now that being a nurse is obsolete, you want to learn a bit about
computers?"
   "I guess I should."
   "Good.  And don't worry about Adam.  If he even THINKS of screwing with
your nanites, I'll help him out."



   The End...

Well, you can still write storys. You can say that the story took place a week
before doomsday or a few weeks, That would give you a time frame to write one
or two storys. Think about it, don't stop writing storys. I would like to see a
sequle to your first story. Just my two mobiums.

Mike:

Decidedly mixed feelings about Pangolin Problems:

>From a narrative point of view, the story's first-rate!  You were able
to keep a fairly complex plotline together while it shifted through 4 or
5 changes.  But Gabriel's character (one of the chief contributions to
the aforementioned complexity) was, for me, a bit troubling.

Admittedly I had to scurry to the dictionary to find out what a pangolin
was.  Still, as I read the story, I couldn't help but think of Gabe as
being essentially the same character as Lord Chaos on an episode of
Disney's Aladdin (in that incarnation: a cat with an Egyptian collar and
voice by Matt Frewer).  Chaos lived to disrupt routine and order and
predictability.  I got very much the same feel from Gabe.

Not that I'm saying that the character is derivative.  What gets me,
though, is the character's...amorality.  Whereas the Mobians are
fighting to restore what Robotnik had taken from them (their world and
their families, a point I'll be making in Bloodlines, Ch. 12), and
Robotnik is motivated by conquest, Gabe's "Life is a game" attitude is
radically different.  To Robotnik it must sound like folly, while to the
Mobians it must ring pretty hollow.  He'd BETTER have the power to back
it up, otherwise he'd get squashed like a grape.

One small nit:

(Note: if you haven't read the story, this involves a major spoiler)


























OK,

At the very end where he leaves Tails the message: "BTW, you have a
virus," the message was a little ambiguous.  Is he referring to Tails
himself, or to the computer with which he read the message (in this
case, Nicole)?  Still, I get the feeling that that kind of ambiguity is
just what Gabe treasures.  So maybe an answer to the question is
meaningless.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

One proposal I made is that Archie Comics start an AOL section comparable 
to the one "Disney Adventures" already has, and that they might want to 
have Archie's entire comics line (not just Sonic) represented.  I also 
noted that I would not be participating as I am not an AOL subscriber.  
There was favorable response to this idea.

For those without AOL access, perhaps Ratman would be willing to accept 
some Sonic-related files at his ftp site.  I can make shorter text files 
of general interest available through the mailing list software.

I also said that the "Notes From the Net" sounds like a good idea and is 
worth a try, as long as they're prepared to get questions like "how do I 
send e-mail to John Doe?" and "how do I access the newsgroup?".

I then went on to say that posted messages/articles ought be considered 
"not for publication" by default unless permission to publish is 
specifically granted.  (Someone might intend to grant permission but 
forget to do so, so permissions can always be requested as well when 
someone has something especially interesting to say.)  This section could 
also have an editor's comment (like the present Sonic-Grams do) that can 
also include "we see on the 'net that someone/several believe(s) _______" 
which could come in handy if someone doesn't want their full message 
and/or e-mail address printed but ______ is especially interesting.

	That would be a acceptable move as long as we, the internet
community also regains accessiblity to the very pages of Archie's
publications.

	I second this idea, provided Ratman has space in his account.

	Theres a lot to do and we will succeed in the long run, I believe.
I believe that Archie Comic Publications, has a lot to benefit from the
internet community and has much to learn from us, who subscribe to the comic.

[article on letter printing ideals deleted]

	I support very much the idea of putting a Net-GRAMS in the section
after the SONIC-Grams and advocate the idea for the other publications
that Archie Publications runs.  My TEN Mobiums worth.

   I guess you could say that.

   Exactly!
   And finally, to keep the "spoiler" tradition:








































>Is he referring to Tails himself, or to the computer with

   Gabe wanted Tails to find it, and he did.  According to the story, you
don't know what Tails did about it (if Nicole was XOR-ed to hell or if Tails
corrected the problem) but Nicole was the one infected.

So you watched a couple of episodes, then saw a bad one, and just
stopped watching?  Sheesh, what if your first SatAM Sonic episode was
the double-Antoine episode?  You probably never would've watched that
show ever again, either.

gets cut-and-pasted into the body of the File.  There WILL be
spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.



[I am indebted to R.D.B. for the following, since the Sally
miniseries has yet to hit the shelves in this corner of Michigan-
-I've GOT to stop buying retail and subscribe!]

Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]

"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!

Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins

she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

Good news: I took two years of it in high school.

Bad news: the masculine form (Lupus) isn't going to be much help here.

Huh?  From a dictionary: "beat off: to drive away".  And if you're implying

I like the name-- it avoids that ghastly "cyber-" prefix.

IMHO, contacting posters and just asking their permission seems the
best way to go.  Having only recently been quoted unawares in a
[undergroundish] magazine myself, I would have really appreciated
being told beforehand, as the original message makes me sound like
a near-illiterate dweeb. :)

(How about a complimentary selected issue of the comic for anyone
who gets published? :) And it might be something worth mentioning
in the FAQ(s) that the comic guys are trolling* for column space..)

The title says all!

I just got back after a full day of cavorting around with the
airplanes (too bad they have Dulcy's service, but I survived),
and I got 59 (!) messages when I checked for mail.  I was 
just kidding when I said I wanted at least 150 messages last
week!  I surrender!

As for the more serious considerations of the week's end, I'm 
starting work on a Post-Doomsday story.  The only hint I can give
y'all right now is that a new character is about to be introduced.
Aside from that, I can't say anymore.  Wait for it.

I've received so much e-mail from the Sonic Net at large, so I'll
try to answer all of it here en masse.  Send messages to me in
private (not via Sonic Net) if I missed anyone:
-Yes, I am the perpetrator of "The Temporal Syndrome".  And I never
 had a clue that the writing (at least to some people) was so dramatic.
 I'll try to tone my style down so that some workers won't have to face
 the customers all teary-eyed......NOT!
-For the record Craig, my name is listed at the top of my .sig.
-No, I haven't read the comics at length, and I feel much more comfortable 
with the
 Saturday morning show (which, I hope, "The Temporal Syndrome" reflected
 as much as possible).  The comics have an effect that doesn't seem right (I 
keep
 comparing it to the show).
-Yes, I am guilty of writing in a dramatic style.  Quick, get the security 
shackles!
-I guess I came back too late to pick up the Rotor pictures from David's FTP
 site.  Let's try that again.

That's all for now!  Kiss a dragon for me;  I'll be busy this Sunday.

<Chuckle>  I think that's me you're replying to.  Please...DON'T change
your style.  Right now, dark, dramatic stories such as TTS are my favorite,
and I think they serve an excellent purpose in the StH universe.  After all,
there is a global war going on against someone who could've been Hitler's
mentor, and that's something I think the comics often forget.  Of course, this
is an Archie comic (should I stop bashing them so much?  Okay, I'll try).
I've got some stories coming along, and once I sit down and watch the show,
I'll get writing.  So far I've got 2 stories involving a new character mapped
out in my mind.  All I need to do is watch the show to fill in the little
details and make sure I'm not contradicting any of the characters'
personalities.

Do what I do...don't worry at all about the comics when writing, unless you
plan on writing specifically for the comic universe.
 
Remember my long-winded arguments in the "Where/What is Mobius?" debates? 
I was saying that I feel that Mobius is the Earth of an alternate universe.
Well, I've since gone on to create the theory that there are no less than
four universes that contain the planet Mobius along with Sonic and
Robotnik.  These four universes are depicted by:

1.  The Saturday morning cartoon.
2.  The Archie comics.
3.  The video games.
4.  The Fleetway comics.

Of course, some of these universes are more parallel than others, and
sometimes events that happened in one universe also happened in another.
But I still consider them separate entities, and the possibility of
continuity between them is impossible without the multi-universe theory.
(A fifth universe, you ask?  Well, okay, but only if you consider the weekday
show worthy of being called a "Sonic universe" :) )

Now, which universe does all the fan-fic come under?  Any one the author wants
it to.  Right now, I figure that all of the authors are setting their
stories in the Sat. morning universe.  I plan on doing the same.

> -Yes, I am guilty of writing in a dramatic style.  Quick, get the security 
> shackles!

Like I said, don't change! :)

Once again, mega-kudos for TTS!!

The "dd" FAQ does mention the "Notes From the Net" proposal, but the "jf" 
FAQ has not been updated since its first release last month.

Delphi has still not picked it up either.  I think quite a few 
list.subscribers still can't get the newsgroup.  But the mailing list 
will be around as long as we all want it to be.

I recorded 5 new sounds from the 3/18 episode.  I have uploaded all of 
them to the ftp site (ftp.mv.com) where they await approval.  Included 
among them is Bunnie's "What the who-ha happened?" for which I got a 
request last year.

All are 8-bit mono, 22kHz .WAV's recorded under Warp 3 MMOS/2.

Would someone volunteer to post the new sounds to 
alt.binaries.sounds.cartoons?  I'd rather not upload the sounds to my 
account twice.

I came this close to absolutely screaming.

Going home for a few days before spring break officially began, I decided
to search my hometown for Sally #2 and Sonic #22.  Well, the comic book
shop closed down last month, so I resorted to searching every gas station,
every drug store, every grocery store, any place I could think of.  Nobody
had anything!!  Nada!  Only when I finally looked in the only book store in
town did I find the Sally issue, but Sonic was still nowhere to be found.

So, coming back to college, I journey to the comic book shop where I found
the two Sonic issues I had bought earlier, shortly after subscribing to this
list.  Well, they had it (along with Sally #1, which I had yet to find), but
their filing system left a lot to be desired.  Seems they don't think very
highly of  "children's comics" (including anything published by Archie)
so all of this month's titles were unceremoniously dumped into one big pile,
on top of the bins carrying back issues of children's stuff.   This means
I had to wade thru 10 gazillion Archie, Betty, Veronica, and other such issues
before finding what appeared to be the only Sonic #22 they had left! 
Sheesh...

Whoever said collecting comic books doesn't give you any exercise?? :-)

Oh well...my contribution to this thread is a little late, but here's my
thoughts on #22.

In a word: great!  Every Sonic issue should be like this.  The story
surrounding Robotnik's return was well done (even if the story surrounding
his initial disappearance was not), and the artwork (especially for Sally)
is spectacular.  Did somebody say that it was a new artist for this month?
Well, (s)he can stay!  I even enjoyed "Tails' Knighttime Story."  This is
an example of Sonic-slapstick put to good use, and the jokes were hilarious.
("Have a real turkey," as he throws down Antoine :-D)

Here's hoping future issues are as good as this one.
On that matter, wish me luck finding #23 when it comes out! :-)

later---Kris

Temporal Notice:  The background of the following story takes
place a few months after the failed Doomsday Project, during the
midsummer of the year 3236.

	The maturity of the day was very near the hour of midnight in
Knothole's time zone.  Almost everyone of the Knothole Freedom
Fighters and their associates from the Wolf Pack and other
groups were asleep in their huts, dreaming the dreams of a
benevolent future for their planet.  Nearly all the lights were
out, to promote each individual's travel into the dream world, a
place where everyone lived an alternate life for the duration of
their time of slumber.  The borders and the interior of the
encampment that was home to members of an extended family, the
members consisting of various decent of status and other aspects
of heritage, were as silent as the vacuum of space.  Almost.
	If one could listen and look with more intensity and
persistence, Knothole was not the perfect example of peaceful
and somber darkness.  In one particular hut, no unlit regions
existed for the blackness to take refuge.  It was a warning to
the agents of the shade that their victory would come another
day, another time in the hereafter.  Or, more than likely, it
was only Rotor and Bookshire in the development phase of yet
another late-night project in Rotor's new workshop.
	Inside, Rotor hefted the massive glass vat from the biogenics
storage closet, a 100 kg cylinder containing twenty kg of an
intricate, carefully balanced powder holding the basic chemical
elements of life.  No DNA or other evidence of order resided in
the powder, but it was a segment of preface to a new artificial
lifeform that Rotor and Bookshire toiled to design for some
time.  He carried it cautiously over to the main computer, where
Bookshire was laboring over the theoretical designs and
composition of the endoskeletal frame.  The middle-aged raccoon
displayed signs of his steadily advancing age, with suggestions
of silver streaking through his fur.  However, when intensely
working on a project worthy of provoking his prowess, he was no
older than his teenage associate.  Younger, in fact, for he
concentrated on such projects like a child with a new playtoy.
	Rotor slowly lowered the vat to a temporary resting place by
the main computer, grunting with the gradual displacement of its
mass from his powerful muscles.  After Robotnik's failed attempt
to finally bring Mobius and its inhabitants groveling to his
feet, he had more leisure time to exercise, both physically and
mentally.  A short time ago, Rotor might not have been able to
perform such an act as carrying the voluminous load the short
distance to the main computer.  Then again, the old Rotor wasn't
the walrus working on the important experiment that night.
	Bookshire sensed Rotor's presence, but did not look up to
examine his comrade.  The majority of his concentration centered
on the computer display, while he softly pressed the appropriate
controls to alter the various parameters of the endoskeleton to
conform to his specifications.  The endoskeleton took the
structure of a young eleven year-old fox, belying the strength
that would normally be present in a lifeform many times its
size.  The new alloy that Rotor and Bookshire designed for the
frame was perfect:  high tensile strength, nearly invulnerable
to multiple weapons-grade laser impacts, stealthy (nearly all
forms of detection devices were blind to its presence, except
optical), and more than adequate to the task of shielding the
organic overlay (on connection to the positronic matrix, it
could expand the stealthy field of influence, retarding nearly
every sensor).
	The raccoon also reviewed the positronic matrix.  It was a work
of art for something that had been conceived of in such a short
time.  Countless hours were spent on the cranial cognitive unit,
which it was more officially known as between the two partners
in cybernetics.  Part computer, part organic design, it would
allow the new lifeform to function and think.  This would
promote interaction with the other Knothole residents.  Many
sleepless nights produced the perfect programming that the new
artificial life would need:  tactics, command procedures,
physiology, and other subjects important to Freedom Fighter
commanders.  For this was to be Sonic's near-future second, if
not his replacement.
	"Whew.  That was some workout.  How's everything at your end?"
the walrus asked his friend.
	Retaining his focus on the computer display, Bookshire replied,
"Faster than expected, Rotor.  The endoskeleton and the
positronic matrix designs are ready for freezing.  I don't think
we left anything out of the system that might be needed."
	"Great.  The sooner, the better.  Sonic's been complaining that
he didn't have any excuse to get out of Knothole these days,
with noone to go on missions with."  Rotor dictated this with an
air of finality.
	In truth, Sonic had been rather wearied by the now perpetual
boredom that seemed to permeate Knothole.  However, there was
more to his mood under the surface.  He was seriously
considering an alteration to the chain of command, wanting to
have more time to devote to his other hobbies.  He tired of not
having the opportunity to make command decisions, or to risk his
life to safe another's.  He thought of taking a step down from
his command position, but had noone to offer it to.  His
relationship with his friends was also taking a precarious turn.
 Sally had been put under increasingly higher degrees of
workload, and didn't have the time that she and Sonic used to
have for leisure in the past.  Sally wasn't the only one;  just
about everyone else had been assigned to other tasks, except
him.  He felt left out, since nothing that he could do seemed to
be available for him to concern himself with.  Ultimately, he
needed something to do, or someone he could talk to that would
understand his condition.  Otherwise, the irritated hedgehog
might die of boredom, a point that he attempted to make
abundantly clear to everyone else at Knothole.
	"Well, I hope that this little project of ours does," said
Bookshire with a grave tone to his voice, "I can't bear to see
Sonic like that anymore.  All alone and depressed, something
must be done, and fast.  That boy's too young to waste away like
he's doing now."
	Rotor nodded in silent agreement, knowing all too well what one
of his closest friends was feeling now, without a function
worthy of his attention.  The two cybernetics experts taxed
themselves further into the early hours of the next day, with no
further verbal exchange on any subject.  Working as a single
entity, they both continued on their task of creating a new
life, and possibly a new comrade for Sonic.

* * *

	At 0800 hours the next morning, the sun's bright rays pierced
through holes in the foliage that protected Knothole from
detection by sensors and other silent, unseen observers.  The
solar radiation continued its confrontation until it came near a
blue teenage hedgehog, sitting on the steps to his home.  It
seemed to notice the mental condition of the hedgehog, for it
softened from a shower of fine thorns to a smoother, blanketing
shape over the hedgehog's body.  After not receiving any
response from this gesture of kindness, the rays intensified
their IR components, as if it was attempting to warm the
beleaguered hedgehog's heart.  Still no reaction from him.  The
rays persisted, as if hoping that the hedgehog would appreciate
their attempt to lighten his mood.  Sonic steadfastly maintained
his hunched-over, sulking position.
	'Man,' he thought to himself, his mind replete with anxiety,
'what am I gonna do with myself?  Sal and everyone else is too
busy to do anything with me.  I can't even help them out, since
I don't have a clue as to even half the stuff they're doing.
I'm gettin' tired of being the Number One hedgehog, 'cause
there's nothing for me to do at the top.  Maybe I need to step
down, give someone else a chance to save Mobius.  But who?'
Sonic had no answer to that question, one that had fused itself
into his mind gradually over the period of time after the
destruction of the Doomsday Project.  Everyone had a position to
fill but him.
	'I wanted to teach the kids, let them know how it's done being
a Freedom Fighter,' Sonic's private tirade continued.  'But
Tails got a hold of that, maybe I taught the big guy TOO well.
Sal's been working on managerial whatever-she-calls-it for who
knows how long, and I ain't any good at that.  I can't even get
a hold of Rotor, since he's always either asleep or working on
that project of his.  And Dulcy's not going anywhere, not with
that hurt leg she got making that bad landing a few weeks ago.'
A labored sigh of dismissal. 'What's a hedgehog like me to do?'
	The sound of differentially-displaced air brought Sonic to his
full alert condition, ready to react to any form of danger.  The
sound was very familiar, but something he had not heard for a
long time, or so it seemed to him.  The sound gradually wavered,
then abruptly ended as an expertly-placed drop to the ground was
executed by a ten year-old red fox.  The fox then paced over to
Sonic's position, with a distressed look on his face.
	"What's ya up to, Sonic?" the concerned red vulpine queried his
best friend and mentor.
	"Nothing at all, Tails," the hedgehog responded, sighing.
"What's a cool dude like you doing hanging around a major drag
like me for?" he questioned, not without a slight hint of
frustration to his voice.
	"Well, you been looking really down lately, Sonic.  I know it's
that you've had nothing to do here, now that Robotnik and
Sneezeley's gone.  I thought I might be able to do something to
cheer you up," Tails said, unable to keep the hopefulness out of
his voice.
	'Why, that little genius,' Sonic thought, his face copious with
surprise.  'He read my mind.'  He said nothing, expecting Tails
to continue prodding the point further.
	He was not disappointed.  "I did have a class to teach today,
but I told everyone else to take the day off.  So, how about it,
Sonic?" the little cub demanded, uncertain what method the
dispirited hedgehog would use to respond with.
	It was Tails' turn to not be disappointed.  "Sure, big guy,"
Sonic finally replied, after contemplating the current
alteration in plans for the day.  He gently stroked Tails' head
with an almost religious reverence, and stared straight into his
eyes with a smile on his face.  "It'll be just like old times,
you and me together."
	Tails chuckled a bit, then said with sincerity, "Yeah, just
like old times.  Race ya past the lookout tower!"  He then
curled his tails together, then slowly levitated from the ground
as his tails rotated around their mutual center of axis.
	"Hey, hold up a bit!" Sonic exclaimed jocularly, all evidence
of downslide in his normally cavorting mood eliminated for the
time being.  Accelerating in place, he called to his airborne
comrade, "OK, three.....two....one....juice time!"
	They discharged themselves from the area as quickly as their
respective legs or tails would permit them, and accelerated
toward their arbitrary finish line.  The race had begun, and
Sonic felt like a new hedgehog again.

	After a few hours of high-velocity enjoyment (amplified by
giving Antoine a few moments of fright by rocketing next to the
tree where he was assigned as lookout), Sonic and Tails returned
to Knothole, halting about three meters in front of Rotor's
workshop.  They were both so exuberant, that Sonic forgot his
former mode of depression, and Tails forgot that his friend was
depressed.  As if remembering something, Sonic quirked his eyes
toward his two-tailed companion.
	"Oh, man!  I give up, Tails!  You beat me every time!" Sonic
blurted out, with an expression of mock anger on his face.
	"Oh, gee," Tails retorted in kind, mimicking Sonic's facial
expression, "next time, I'll make sure I beat you by more than a
few seconds!"
	More hopelessly uncontrollable laughter flowed from their
mouths.  Unable to repress the urge, they embraced and kissed
each other, like long-lost friends that had met again after
years of separation.  Sonic was beginning to feel more like
himself again, and he enjoyed it as much as Tails did.  He felt
as if he had finally found a role to conform to in Knothole, and
that was to be Tails' friend.  An act of gratitude that he had
not had the time to display recently, and he pondered over why
he didn't do such a thing sooner.  He found no answer to his
personal inquiry, and didn't concern himself with that at the
moment.
	"Hey, Sonic," the young vulpine said to his associate in
gaiety, after regaining control of his guffawing, "how about we
go see Rotor and Bookshire?  I bet ya they're working on that
new project right now."
	The more senior hedgehog considered the matter for a few
seconds, with his arms crossed and his left foot rapping the
ground.  "I don't know, kid," he said thoughtfully.  "They might
be too busy to worry about us."
	"Ah, come on, Sonic," his little friend pleaded.  "Besides,
they invited me to come over here yesterday.  They said that it
might be ready to show off now."
	More silence and concerned thought from the hedgehog.  He
wasn't entirely enthusiastic about interrupting Rotor and
Bookshire in the middle of what they regarded as an important
activity, since none of the technobabble would make any coherent
sense to him anyway.  However, he was interested in at least
knowing what the project was, considering the fact that the
specifics and even generalities had been concealed from him.
When he was satisfied with his decision, he replied, "OK, Tails.
 Let's see what their little secret project is."
	The two companions trotted to the entrance of Rotor's workshop.
 They arrived together at the door, and came to an uneasy stop.
For reasons unknown to him, Sonic somehow forfeited his nerve to
enter the hut.  His former reservations resurfaced, as he
thought about how too premeditated and convenient this encounter
appeared to be.  The windows emitted no illumination from the
interior, and something about the way Tails dictated his
suggestion forced the hedgehog to delay his advance.  He looked
to his friend;  Tails revealed nothing, but patiently waited for
the hedgehog to signal a request for entry.
	"Go ahead, Sonic," his two-tailed comrade commanded
encouragingly, "knock on the door.  It won't bite."
	The reluctant hedgehog complied with the order, totally
prepared for what he expected to happen.  He was equally
unprepared for the unexpected events.
	The door opened, with a suspicious creaking sound attached to
its movement on the hinges.  A shaded figure of a blue walrus
lingered inside, beyond the doorway in the darkness.  He
gestured to them for passage, and the hedgehog and fox gradually
paced into the dimmed workshop.  Sonic gazed around the
blanketing blackness, endeavoring to focus his eyes.
	As if in retaliation, the room suddenly altered in form.  He
was blinded by the sudden increase in illumination, and deafened
by the multitude of voices crying out the word, "Surprise!"
	'Whoa,' Sonic thought to himself, 'what's going on here?'  He
rubbed his eyes to compensate for the appearance of light where
there was only an unlit region about two seconds ago.  After his
eyes finally terminated the task of focusing, he noticed that
all his friends in and out of Knothole were waiting for him.
	Sally walked over to the baffled hedgehog.  "Surprise, Sonic.
I hope you like it," she said, then kissed him.  "I'm sorry that
we've been keeping you in the dark about this, but now's a good
a time as any to reveal it to you."
	Sonic's jaw dropped with an almost audible thunk.  "You mean,"
he ventured, "that all this time you've been busy working on
whatever that is?  And you were fibbing about all that
administrative work you were doing?"  His outstretched finger
indicated the endoskeleton and the vat full of the prepared
organic mixture.
	It was Bookshire's turn to explain the rationale of their
former, "busy" atmosphere.  He carefully limped over to Sonic to
illustrate the actual scene of events.  "Not exactly, Sonic," he
answered to his confused juvenile comrade.  "You see, we know
that you've been bored and all, with nothing to do here at
Knothole while the rest of Mobius isn't in danger anymore.  So
we decided that you probably wanted to step down off your
command status so that you would have more time to do other
things.  That's when the idea came up to design a new Freedom
Fighter."
	"New Freedom Fighter?" the hedgehog inquired.  "To replace me?"
	"It can take whatever position in the chain of command you
want," the raccoon continued, "it can be the commander of
Knothole, or like a first officer to you.  It's your choice,
Sonic."
	"What about training and everything else?"
	"Don't worry about this one.  The new artificial lifeform will
be totally self-sufficient, and it's programmed to have basic
emotions, ability to command, repair itself, and other
functions.  We also gave it the ability to dynamically respond
to new situations, learn from them.  Not a problem at all," the
experienced raccoon reassured.
	"How's it repair itself?" the still-cynical hedgehog asked.
	"It has nanites in it to take care of damage and construct new
parts," Bookshire replied.  Seeing a shocked expression on the
hedgehog's face again, he continued, "No, not those nanites.
These nanites aren't programmed to do anything to us;  their
made for the compuorganic lifeform."  Bookshire was all too
aware of the unpleasant memories the word had to Sonic, not to
mention the rest of the Freedom Fighters.
	"Cool.  So when's it gonna be active?" the now-interested Sonic
questioned.
	Tails took charge of leading him to the main computer.  "Right
over on that computer, Sonic.  Press that big red switch."  As
he and his companion walked to the computer, Tails didn't notice
the large bundle of cables lying stretched out across the floor.
	Sonic saw the cables first.  "Tails, the ca-" he tried to warn
his friend.
	It was too late.  Tails foot located the cables and reacted via
the appropriate physical laws of the universe, long before his
eyes could see them and direct his body to avoid.  He flew
across the space between his former location and the main
computer, his nose impacting with the indicated red key that
would activate the new lifeform.  Before his blackout, Tails
slid down the side of the computer, opening one of the storage
compartments.  After coming to rest on the floor in a
semi-unconsious state, mind probing electrodes attached
themselves to his head.
	The room exploded into a blinding radiance. Inside the vat with
the organic mixture, the component atoms combined and
recombined, forming a DNA structure over the endoskeletal frame.
 The nanites worked hard at their labors, manipulating the
organic overlay into the appropriate electrical and organic
constituents.  Influxes of data came from Tails, as the cranial
positronic unit scanned the information by utilizing the remote
electrodes on his head.  The process continued on for about ten
seconds.
	Tails woke up to see a black and dark gray fox, about his
height and size, trapped in the glass vat.  One powerful fist
strike later, and glass shards erupted from the vat, spreading
over the floor like a tidal wave crashes over a ocean-front
city.  Everyone else in the room watched in horror as the new
artificial lifeform slowly paced across the room in a precise,
measured cadence toward Tails, making no sound as it did.  When
it arrived at its location in front of its organic counterpart,
it gently and flawlessly lifted the dazed vulpine up to examine
his condition.
	What the compuorganic lifeform said was even more startling.
"What has occurred to format my brother into his current state?"
it demanded, seemingly concerned about Tails' condition.  The
voice was so much like Tails, only this particular vocalization
was that of an adolescent fox.  It was deeper and slightly
harsher, yet still very similar to that of its organic
counterpart.
	Tails replied for all the observers in the room.  "Waht?" he
asked, bewildered by the turn of events.  He attempted to force
the stinging pain from his nose.  "Wo's 'or bro'her?  I ain' 'or
bro'her."
	The artificial lifeform didn't have any difficulty interpreting
its "brother's" speech.  "My medical sensors detect a minor
concussion in your olfactory region, and it is in my estimation
that you have been injured in a procedure which I am unaware of.
 Please allow me, brother, to attend to your ailments.  I have
no intention of inducing any detriment to your organic
configuration."
	The awestruck organic fox's eyes expanded wide with primal
fear.  He struggled to escape from the grasp of his oppressor,
and succeeded in his savage body motions.  Tails screamed,
staring a hardened sneer into the compuorganic's video
receptors, "You're not my brother, and I never want to see you
again, you robot!"  He darted out of the workshop before anyone
could detain him, and disappeared into the Great Forest.  The
new lifeform could only observe the scene that occurred,
speechless and almost upset by the unfavorable reaction that
Tails displayed.
	"Someone's gotta go after Tails," Sonic finally said, returning
to reality again.
	"I'll take care of this," replied Dulcy.  "Besides, he can fly,
and I might have a better chance of getting him."
	"Yo, Dulce," the baffled hedgehog queried, "what about your
leg?"
	"Oh, this?" she answered.  "This was the only way I could think
of from telling you about the project too early.  There's
nothing wrong with it.  You know how much I can babble at
times."  As if proving her point that her leg had sustained no
damage, she prodded out of the hut and used it to force herself
away from the ground, then flew off to retrieve Tails.
	Sally walked over to comfort their latest addition to the
Freedom Fighter group.  "Are you OK?" she asked, concerned about
how it would react to prejudice immediately after it had just
been constructed.
	It took in a deep breath, as if to calm itself.  "I am fully
functional, physically and mentally," it stated, "however, I am
rather perturbed by the way Tails reacted to my endeavors to
assist him.  I also realize that lack a denomination, something
for others to know me by."
	Sally thought the matter over.  "How about....David?" she
suggested.
	"Very well, then," the compuorganic replied, "that shall be
sufficient for my purposes of identification."  He smiled, as if
pleased with the privilege of having a name.
	Sally embraced and kissed him, gratified to have him as a new
Freedom Fighter and companion.  Not quite certain how to respond
to this gesture of kindness, he returned the act to her, making
certain his finely-tuned tactile sensors returned signals of a
firm, but tame grip.  David did not desire to destroy a
near-future ally in the college of life.

	And learn David most certainly did.  He found that there were
many functions to life besides his undecided role in the chain
of command.  Over the period of three weeks, David accomplished
many tasks to improve his status in his new domicile.  He
learned more about the intricacies of his organic companions'
speech and emotional displays.  He also learned how to fly,
since his endoskeleton was modeled very closely after Tails.
After some instruction from Dulcy and receiving her experience
from seeing what procedures Tails used to hover, fly, and land,
David became capable of flying to almost any location.  He
studied novels, encyclopedias, poetry, and it seemed as if there
was no way to quench David's lust for information.  He
instructed his nanites to manufacture appropriate hardware for
upgrading his survivability, and to improve the preexisting
equipment that he had built inside him.  Yet, there was one area
which he failed to complete successfully:  his relationship to
Tails.  As David built up his emotional database, that fact only
served to compile to complex and frustratingly gargantuan
proportions.
	In reality, the situation was no more severe than it was on
David's first day of life.  Through an almost telepathic
agreement, for Tails had no intention of being anywhere near
David, they managed to maintain a respectable distance.  Sally
counseled him about his bind with Tails;  Sonic tried to
convince Tails to rethink his misgivings about David.  Nothing
seemed to work.  The only alternative was to permit Tails a wide
berth from David.  For a while, everything was almost perfect,
as long they did so.  However, as life would have control over
events, this status of peace would not survive for an extended
period of time.

	David was pacing around the Knothole/Great Forest border near
the bridge at about 1700 hours, testing his latest sensors for
accuracy.  During his passive IR scan, he noticed a form appear
about thirty meters in front of him as he directed his head
forward.  Intrigued by this, he converted his sensors to visible
light scan, and magnified the image.  It was a young female
skunk, about Tails' age and height.  Nina saw David and ran over
to him.
	David downloaded the required data about Nina into one of his
dynamic provisional memory storage units.  What he read he
didn't enjoy at all.  According to his data, Nina was a close
friend to Tails.  And if Tails saw David and Nina together, the
situation could become an unsettling one for all three parties.
That was one confrontation that he had no intention of
participating in.  David's stress registers increased with the
anticipated battle that would ensue if he didn't act to prevent
it.  He turned around to evade the near-future battle.
	It was too late.  Nina already had him contained in her
powerful grasp, and David had no hope of immediate salvation
except to implement his overwhelming strength.  He was unable to
do so, for any such act would critically injure Nina, and part
of his basic moralistic programming prevented him from doing so.
 His respect for life was too strong to justify a violent
response.  Therefore, other, more civil procedures would have to
be acted on.
	"Oh, David!" the young skunk exclaimed to him, not softening
her grip one iota.  "It's so good to see you again!  It's about
time you got away from those adults and over to those your own
age!"
	David attempted to find a diplomatic mean of escape.  "Nina, I
would very much appreciate your friendly attitude towards me, if
you would please allow me to maintain a respectable distance!"
	"Oh, sorry about that," she apologized, and complied with his
implied request.  "It's just that I've never had a chance to see
you personally, I got a little too excited."
	"You aren't the only one that might get excited," David
retorted, as kindly as possible.  "According to my information,
you are Tails' friend, and....Tails and I do not exactly have an
amicable relationship as of this current time.  I have no desire
to be the perpetrator of any distress between the two of you,"
David stated, using all of his sensors to locate Tails before he
and Nina severely got into trouble.
	Tails was located about 300 meters away, but his location was
surrounded by trees.  It was more than likely that he would not
see David and Nina, but David wasn't inclined to take any risks.
 He said so to Nina.
	"Why can't you two get along?" she inquired.  "From what I saw
over the past few weeks, you're not the one at fault for this."
	That took David completely off guard.  He was uncertain as to
how to answer Nina's question.  Of course, David wasn't at fault
for anything, except for being created.  And that, he had no
control over.
	He never had the opportunity to answer.  Tails arrived, his
eyes silted and teeth exposed with anger.  David measured Tails'
stress levels, and found that an eruption was about to take
place, no matter what David could try to prevent it with.  His
organic counterpart stood in his position, slowly breathing with
a dangerous tension.
	"What...are...you...doing...with...Nina?" Tails managed to
slowly spit out, unable to control the rage in his voice.
	Nina answered for David.  "He's just talking to me;  nothing
more.  I just wanted to be friends with him after I saw him away
from all the adults here."  Her calm voice belied the anger she
was feeling toward Tails and the way he was treating David.
	"That doesn't matter!  He's a robot, something to take us back
to Robotropolis whenever he has the chance to!" Tails barked
out, even more stressed than before.
	Nina continued as calmly as the situation would permit, "No,
David's a Freedom Fighter, just like you are.  And nothing is
going to change that!"
	David wished that he could contribute something to the
conversation, but considered the consequences beforehand.  It
would ultimately serve to further degrade the already tenuous
relationship he had with Tails.  And the condition was becoming
more precarious just from this exchange.
	"Well, what do you need to associate with a robot for?  He
doesn't have anything to give you, he's emotionless, stupid, and
the worst excuse I've ever seen for a brother!"  With that last
remark, Tails ran back into the Great Forest.
	Little did Nina and Tails know that a storm was advancing over
the area.  And Tails was in the middle of it, unheeding of the
warnings.  David warned Nina of the situation.
	"Someone has to go after him, at least to teach him a lesson,"
Nina replied, unable to maintain the level of calm she had only
a few seconds ago.  She moved to go after him.
	"No," he ordered, extending his hand to block her path.  "I'll
retrieve Tails."
	"Are you sure about that, David?" his friend asked.
	"I will have a higher probability of retrieving Tails, since I
have capabilities to utilize that you don't have available," he
answered, with a determined look on his face.  "The way you can
assist me is to get help from the others in Knothole.  I require
their presence here in order to prevent the situation from
becoming critical."
	She considered his orders, but said nothing further.  She knew
what the unspoken words were.  She then ran off to Knothole, as
quickly as she could.
	David did the same, only in the opposite direction.  With all
his sensors active, he searched for Tails as far as he could
scan.  After locating his trail, he rushed to Tails' aid.

	About fifteen minutes later, David located his counterpart.
Tails was sitting on a rock, apparently unheeding of the rain
pouring down on him, and the thunder which seemed to be getting
closer every second.  Tails was also blind to David's arrival,
since he made no indication that he noticed the compuorganic
fox's presence.  Then again, in the darkness created by the
storm, David would be the only one who could view anything.  He
thought with a belated sense of worthiness that he didn't send
Nina, or tell her to send anyone after the two foxes.  They
would have become as lost as Tails appeared to be.
	"Tails?" he called over the thunder.  "It's me, David."
	"Get away!" the other fox retorted.  "We don't have anything to
talk about!"
	"On the contrary," David replied, maintaining his outer calm,
"we have everything to discuss.  Starting with the condition
between us."
	"There's nothing I have to say to you, David!" Tails yelled,
wishing that he could be alone right now and nothing else.
	"Please, Tails!" David nearly pleaded.  "Tell me what it is
that troubles you about me!"
	As if the very storm had tired of the confrontation between the
two foxes, a fork of lightning streaked down the sky and found
an impact point on a nearby tree.  The violated branch erupted
into flames, falling straight down on Tails' position.  He saw
the branch and instinctively crouched over, in the hope that
this would protect him.
	David took action to rescue Tails from a conflagration that
would otherwise consume him.  He flew up to the falling branch,
and disengaged his rotating tails.  Utilizing both of his tails,
David swatted the flaming branch, dislocating it from its lethal
flight path.  Tails was safe for now.
	On the ground, Tails waited for the fiery death to fill his
field of vision.  It never came.  The only sounds he could hear
were the rain, thunder, and David's tails slowly returning him
from the tormented areas above ground.  He saw David stop
rotating his tails about two meters above ground, then expertly
drop to the ground, landing so that the shock would dissipate
through his body.  Tails' savior slowly walked over to him, his
face a testimony to worry.
	"You...you really care about me?" Tails asked, not trusting his
voice to sound coherent.
	David understood him without difficulty.  "Of course I care
about you," he responded, "as well as the rest of the Freedom
Fighters.  What ever gave you the impression I didn't?  Is that
what you were concerned about?"
	Tails started crying, for he had overlooked something in David,
and had neglected him for so long.  He felt sorry for David, and
ashamed of himself for harboring the prejudice he had, just for
the fact that David was something of a form he had no personal
control over.  He got up and hugged David, and didn't release
his grip on him for a long time.
	Sniffling, Tails said, "I'm sorry I treated you the way I did,
David.  I just didn't know that you really cared about me so
much.  I thought you would go crazy and send us back to
Robotropolis or something."
	"Tails," David answered jovially, "you know me better than
that.  Besides, even if I did want to take you back to
Robotropolis, I couldn't."
	"Why's that?" Tails inquired, the shamed look on his face
converting to one of wonder.
	"Because you're like a brother to me," David continued, "and
there's no Robotropolis available for me to send you and the
rest of the Freedom Fighters to."
	"It's good to have you back.....brother."
	They both shared in a mutual session of laughter, then David
gradually guided his brother back to the refuge of Knothole.

* * *

	The next day, there was no indication of the adversarial state
that existed between Tails and David.  They were like two foxes
that had finally found themselves, which in this case, they did.
 Sally and Sonic watched from a distance as they saw the two
foxes actually playing together, instead of Tails being at
David's throat, and David doing everything in his power to
escape.  They were like friends, or (dare they think it?)
brothers that were concerned for each other's welfare.
	"I can't believe it, Sonic," Sally said after the realization
struck her as to what the fox pair was doing.  "It seems like
they were enemies just yesterday.  I wonder what brought Tails
out of it?"
	"Don't know, Sal," the hedgehog said, equally awed by the
transition.  "I asked them earlier, but they wouldn't tell me
why."
	"Maybe it's just as well that way.  These two are going to be a
powerful team in the future."
	And the condition of Tails' transition remained a secret, to
everyone in Knothole.  All that mattered now is that they loved
each other like brothers of a long acquaintance.  They both
agreed to tell everyone one thing though:  that David's name be
changed to David Prower.

I guess I'm not much of an art critic because I happen to like the way
just about everyone has drawn Sonic in the Archie comics.  As long as
they don't screw up Rotor like they did in Sonic's 2nd season (on ABC)
I'll probably be happy. 

I do notice what I guess I can call a 'mildly disturbing trend' in the
Archie comics though.  It seems that all new characters aren't nearly
as 'abstract' as the originals.

Even though I don't get this alt group (we never get any of those good ones..
we DO get all the alt.binaries.pictures.<nude-lewd-and-crude> groups :-/

I like the idea of having a 'Notes from the Net' section in the Archie comics.
I doubt you'd be able to print the large essays which folks seem to like to
post on the net though :)

I've sometimes seen accents put 'after' the letter when trying to type

Here's a suggestion.  I was thinking it might be better if show and comic

That's true..  I typed it up in a weekend and kinda gave it up when I noticed

Somewhere between 165 and 225 unread!  Lord, that took
forever to sort through.  Anyway - as for the royal
status of Sonic on Mobius, I figure Sally wouldn't have
let their relationship go this far publically if she
didn't think marrying him was a possibility.  Nor,
under the circumstances, do I think that conventional
formalities are going to prevent him from taking any
title she feels is appropriate - but I doubt seriously
he'll ever take any significant role in government.
Although it's really hard to say - much of his
attitude is shaped by the role he's forced to be in at
the moment.  Given a few years, he could be almost as
active a ruler as Sally.
     I took latin, too!  I don't remember if her name
was a long or short 'a' in English.  It'd be rendered
either Lupa or Lupae.  I think 'Lupa' because that's
the way I had it stored in my head.

I was reading some of the episode summaries in the "dd" FAQ, and one says 
that the King has spent too much time in The Void to be able to function 
on Mobius anymore.  Does this mean he can never be returned to power?  Is 
Sally now destined to become Queen?

I've not seen this episode yet, but feel free to post any info or

I'm not either.  Nothing made that clearer to me than when reading all 
the arguements in alt.tv.animaniacs about how bad <insert name>'s 
animation is.

I would like to see Tails colored in the comic more like the way he is in 
the Saturday morning cartoon.  As I understand it, he is a red fox but 
doesn't look at all red in the comic.

I have from time to time got the feeling when reading the comic that I 
was looking at a 24-bit color .JPG quantized down to 256 colors.  It 
seems the comic employs a limited color set.  This may be caused by the 
limitations of its publishing.  I realize there's only so much you can do 
when printing on newsprint; my local newspaper doesn't print many quality 
photos in color.

The ` is a grave accent.  The best we can do for an acute accent is '.

Erich:

Good question.  The situation is muddied by the reappearance of Sally's
father (apparently in one piece) in the Married With Children scenario
at the end of "Sally's Quest" (In Your Face #1).  So escape would appear
to be possible.

Assuming that he COULD eventually get out of the Void (and exactly how
that could be accomplished is something for those of us who dabble in
fanfic to consider), the question of succession rears it head.
Theoretically, the King could legitimately reclaim the throne...unless
he chooses to abdicate in favor of Sally.  Heaven knows, she would have
earned it!

If I recall the episode summary correctly, Sonic at point allowed himself 
to get sucked into The Void.  If that is indeed correct, escape must be 
possible or Sonic would still be there.  Of course, he wasn't in as long 
as the King was.  But if Sonic knew how to escape himself, when did he 
find out and how?  It must have been shortly before that episode; 
otherwise, the King would have been rescued (possibly in time) prior to 
that episode.

The Sally mini-series #1 gets around the issue by saying that no one is 
certain of his fate now.

I was going to have a reference to him in the story I am co-writing, but 
now I'm not so sure I can do it (the reference, the story's still in 
progress).

I don't really have anything to base this on, but I get the feeling Sally 
would be content with (if not preferring) he reclaim the throne unless he 
asked her to take his place.  Any speculation on what he would want to do?

It might be better to spin this off into another thread, but what should 
become of Robotnik after his final defeat (assuming he is not killed in 
action)?  Any chance Sonic, Sally, and the King might even agree on what 
to do with him?

In fact, "The Void" had a few gaping plotholes in it, and viability
outside the Void is one of them.  Both the King and Naugus began to
crystallize once they were back on Mobius because they had "stayed too
long" in the Void.  Ari, however, was able to get out with no ill
effects.  As to their means of escape: Sonic can run fast.  End of
explanation.  His speed is apparently enough to counter the pull into
the Void.  Like I said, major plothole.

At the time the stories are being played out, remember, Sally has not
yet "come of age" and won't for another two years (cf. "Drood Henge.")
Assuming it's part of the Mobian constitution, the King would still be
the legitimate power unless someone else were to be appointed as regent
if the King felt he couldn't rule.  In any event, Sal's going to have to
be patient.

As for Robotnik, I don't see him surrendering under any circumstances.
A fight to the (real or presumed) death is most likely.

     Near the end of 'The Void' Nagus declares that he
and King Acorn have spent 'too much time in the Void'
and are therefore unable to leave without it trying to
suck their lifeforce back in.  Nagus declares that he
can control, and therefore presumably reverse, this
process - but only from inside the void.  Please note
that there is no reason to assume that ANY of this
applies to any continuity other than that of the
Saturday Morning Cartoon.  In the case of the Archie
comic, this is confused by the serious lack of
continuity between issues as they switch to a format
which seems to more and more resemble the Saturday
episodes.  In any case, Ari, Sonic, and the girls are
immune simply because they haven't been there very
long.  Due to the highly questionable continuity
between first and second seasons, it's impossible to
say just how long the King had been there.

That's exactly how I've come to view this whole mess of
continuity ... the games, books, shows, and comics are
all different stories with the same characters.  There are
some major similarities, but on the whole, each makes much
more sense if read/viewed seperately.  Otherwise, arguements
start to arise over what's the "real" story and not...(Id est - species
arguements, roboticizer arguements, character arguments, plotline and
continuity arguments, etc., etc.) {any of this sound familliar?}    ;)

Well, ignoring the 1500 year time lapse between the 2
seasons, The King would have been in the Void 11 years.

How's the name pronounced exactly?  (The 2nd season has yet to be
seen in Australia. I'll grovel for someone to send over a few
episodes (for review purposes only I assure; I'll blank the tapes

It was pronounced LOO-pay.  I decided *not* to go with a phonetic
rendering for reasons that are obvious to someone who uses the Queen's
English.

Am I missing something here?

Aside from an offhand date concerning the establishment of Ironlock
Prison, I don't remember any dates being tossed around during the first
season, and nothing in the second season aside from "Blast to the Past."
If I missed something, please let me know.  We FAQ Filers are supposed
to deal with problems like this!

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 7

     

     It was difficult to say whether any day in Robotropolis was
a "good day."  It was difficult enough to tell if it was day at
all.  A pall of pollution perpetually hung over the city,
produced by Robotnik's various factories and generators.  To
fight against this darkness, lights blazed continually across the
city.  The result was that the city knew neither day nor night in
the accepted sense; instead, it existed in a sick, perpetual
twilight.
     No, it wasn't easy to say whether any day was a good day in
Robotropolis, but for one of its two human inhabitants, it was
shaping up to be a very bad day indeed.
     It had started out well enough for Snively, nephew of Dr.
Robotnik and now his longsuffering lackey.  The day before had
been the day to test a new development: a "whisper technology"
filter that could be retrofitted to Robotnik's hover units.  With
the filters in place, the hover units would be almost completely
silent.  With this advantage, it was thought that Robotnik could
get the drop on the Knothole freedom fighters once and for all. 
Even Robotnik's arch-nemesis, Sonic the Hedgehog, would be caught
completely off guard.
     That was Snively's hope, and it appeared that that hope
would be realized.  The onboard camera recorded the hover unit's
approach to the Great Forest where, somewhere, the freedom
fighters had their hiding place.  Luckily, there was a fog that
morning, so Snively let the hover unit come in on instruments. 
And in another stroke of good fortune, a recent reconaissance
photo showed something like a lookout post in the area.  And most
fortunate of all, that morning one of the Knothole freedom
fighters--the files showed that her name was Bunnie--was filmed
on infrared climbing onto the platform, completely unaware of the
hover unit.
     This was too much of a temptation to pass up.  Snively
ordered that the hover unit with its compliment of eight SWATbots
should pull up to the platform, take Bunnie prisoner and return
to base.  This would be a crowning moment: a successful test of
the hover technology would be sweet enough, but the capture of
one of the Knothole renegades would be even sweeter.  Snively
watched with mounting glee as he switched to the outboard camera,
recording the first SWATbot's moves to apprehend Bunnie.
     And then something went very, very wrong.
     The next thing Snively knew, all eight SWATbots had left the
ship but none had returned.  He set all cameras to record what
was happening and watched the monitors as best he could.  It was
apparent that the weight of the SWATbots had collapsed a portion
of the platform, but that only accounted for some of the eight
bots going offline.  Something had happened to the others,
something that was so unplanned for and that happened so fast
that it served to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
     When Snively realized that all eight SWATbots were offline,
he quickly scanned the forest floor.  There was not enough room
for the hover unit to maneuver and with the fog he wasn't able to
see as much as he'd wanted to.  He thought he recorded an image
of Bunnie on the ground, either unconscious or dead, but the fog
made positive identification hopeless.  There was nothing left to
do but to manually recall the empty hover unit and examine the
film.
     Snively had just finished doing so and, still not quite
believing what he had seen, was on his way to report the news to
Dr. Robotnik.  This was not, he said to himself, going to be a
good day.
     At the threshold of Robotnik's briefing room he paused to
make sure his clothes were in order.  No point compounding
ineptitude with shabbiness.  He stepped inside.
     "I've read your preliminary report," Robotnik said in a low
rumble of a voice, which came out as a kind of growl.  "Why did
you fail me?"
     "It wasn't quite a failure, Sir.  The whisper technology on
the hover unit worked beyond all expectations of...."
     "I don't care about the whisper technology on the hover
unit; I want to know what happened to my SWATbots!!"
     "Y-yes, Sir.  Beginning analysis of surveillance film, Sir."
     The image from the film filled a large screen at one end of
the room.  The image was a little grainy and monochrome, but it
clearly showed Bunnie climbing the rope ladder, unaware of the
hover unit not far from her.
     At the sight of her, Robotnik clenched the fist of his own
roboticized left arm.  He didn't like any of the freedom
fighters, least of all the hedgehog, but the sight of Bunnie
particularly vexed him.  She represented unfinished business.  He
*hated* unfinished business.
     The film rolled on, the camera drawing closer and closer to
the unsuspecting Bunnie.  There was a jump in the film as the
outboard camera clicked in.  They could see the first SWATbot
advancing towards Bunnie.
     There was a blur as someone or something dropped down behind
the bot.  The shadowy figure could then be seen holding a tree
branch and swinging it at the bot.  The SWATbot's head came away
from its body cleanly.
     Then a second SWATbot stepped into the camera, obscuring the
sight of the figure.  But not for long; the figure was soon
visible again, through a hole punched into the bot's midsection. 
The bot then crumbled.
     Other bots filled the camera's field of vision, though most
of them dropped out of the picture as the platform section they
were standing on gave way beneath their collective weight.  The
shadowy figure, on the other hand, appeared to be dangling from a
rope around its waist.  It seemed to make a grab at someone,
Bunnie probably, but could not hold on.  The image was lighted by
a SWATbot blast, and the figure swung out of camera range.
     The camera followed her with an unsteady movement.  By the
time it settled on her, there were two SWATbots standing in front
of her and two more in pieces at her feet.  Maybe three seconds
had passed.
     Robotnik studied the view screen, his brow furrowing above
his dark eyes.  Suddenly he sat upright.  The figure on the
screen had shed her cape, but had left her veil and headdress in
place.  
     "Snively!  Freeze that image!!"
     Rushing to the controls, Snively halted the action on
screen.  The figure was a blur, but some things could be made
out: it wore a belt from which hung a number of objects, only a
few of them recognizable to Robotnik.  She also wore boots, which
were little better than yards of rags wrapped around her feet.  
     And then there was that right arm.  Even on the surveillance
film it was clear to tell that it was a robot arm.
     "Snively!  Enhance the view of that arm!"
     "Right away, Sir."  He adjusted the controls and the image
was blown up to twice its size.
     "Larger, Snively!"
     "But Sir, we're starting to lose resolution as it is."
     Robotnik studied the image for a few silent seconds.
     "Never mind, then," he said with a casual air that stunned
Snively.  "Continue showing the film."
     "Y-yes Sir." Bewildered, Snively complied.
     It only took another five seconds for the figure to disable
the last two bots: the first bot had one of its legs torn off,
and the other crumpled after a maneuver that caused both Robotnik
and Snively to wince in pain.  Then she was gone.  The last
minute of the film was only surveillance of a foggy, and
apparently empty, forest.  Snively hated to see the film end, for
he knew that the wrath of Robotnik was sure to follow.
     "Snively," Robotnik said calmly, "continue surveillance on
that part of the Great Forest and inform me if anyone comes to
rebuild that platform.  You may go."
     Stunned, Snively was not about to question his good fortune.
 "Very good, Sir," he said snappily, and left.  Amazed at having
survived the briefing in one piece, Snively thought that maybe
this was going to be a good day after all!
     Inside the conference room, Robotnik spent the next half-
hour playing and replaying the film.  At the end of that time he
was certain of what he had seen.  
     "So," he mused, "it would appear that the little princess is
back, and in one piece."  He began to consider how best to deal
with this unfinished business.  He *hated* unfinished business!

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 8



     He wasn't sure how he had gotten there, but Sonic found
himself heading toward Robotropolis at full speed.  Above him,
the sky had grown darker than it had ever been, with the clouds
swirling around in no particular direction, like water boiling in
a pot.
     Jamming past the buildings, he noticed out of the corner of
his eye that they seemed older than he'd remembered, and on the
verge of falling apart.  "Ol' Buttnik's really letting the place
go to seed!  Well, after today it'll be all over."
     Sonic turned a corner and screeched to a halt.  There was
Robotnik, standing alone in the middle of the street.  Not a bot
anywhere in sight.
     "This is it, Robuttnik!  It's game over for you!"
     But Robotnik didn't seem very concerned about Sonic.  Nor
did he seem to notice the wind whipping down the streets, or the
mad tempest in the sky.  And when he spoke, his voice was distant
and cold as a stone:
     "You don't understand, hedgehog.  You can't win.  Nobody
wins.  We all lose."
     In that instant, a change came over Robotnik.  Starting
with his feet, it was as if every molecule in his body suddenly
came unglued.  He began to disintegrate, fragmenting into
thousands of particles that were caught by the wind and
scattered.  The last to go was Robotnik's face, with a look of
hopelessness that Sonic had never seen before.
     But then Sonic had something new to think about.  For as he
looked about him, every building in Robotropolis began to fly
apart in a similar manner.  Even the ground beneath his sneakers
dissolved into a black, seemingly-endless nothing.  In a cold
panic, Sonic turned and raced back to Knothole, trying to put as
much distance as possible between himself and the approaching
nothingness behind him.
     He reached Knothole, but he was too late.  The sky above him
was the same swirling madness.  In the wind and gloom he could
see Sally silently sinking into the ground beneath her.  He had
to do something.  He raced over to her, grabbed for her hand, and
felt it melt away in his own as if it were ice.  Then he watched
as the last of Sally, her eyes silently pleading for help,
slipped into dust.
     Then the last trace of Mobius disappeared.  Sonic was
surrounded by a formless darkness.  He felt himself falling--not
falling down or in any particular direction, just falling.  And
he knew he would fall forever and ever.
     "NO!"
     With a start, Sonic awoke from his dream.  He was shaken,
sweating and exhausted.  This wasn't your usual one-chilidog-too-
many nightmare!
     Then he heard it, the sound coming from a nearby hut, one
with lights inside.  A voice...Sally's voice...trying to scream
out the word "No" over and over, repeatedly hindered by her own
sobs.
     Sonic saw his Uncle Chuck standing at the window, looking
out.  He got out of bed and walked over to him.  Sonic bowed his
head and felt his eyes filling with tears, as he also felt Uncle
Chuck's hand resting on his shoulder.
     "It's over, Sonie," was all he could say.  "It's over."


     In a better and more peaceful time, the death of the Queen
of Mobius would have been a solemn state occasion.  The sparkling
white buildings of the city would have been dotted with black
banners.  A large canopy would have been erected in the palace
gardens.  Beneath it would have rested the handcarved wooden
casket of the Queen, covered by an elegant white pall embroidered
with the name of the deceased and the symbol of her family's
house--in the case of Queen Alicia, the House of Twin Trees. 
There it would remain for a day and a night as mourners from
every corner of Mobius and from every walk of life would file by
to pay their last respects.  Then the casket would be carried by
mourning family members into the Great Hall of the palace. 
There, a massed choir would sing the "Return," the traditional
Mobian requiem, in the seven-part harmony reserved for the
occasion.  Finally, the pall would slowly be raised to the
ceiling of the Great Hall, where it would hang as a banner from
that day forward, while the body of the Queen would have been
laid to rest in the royal burial chamber beneath the palace.
     But there was no more palace, no more city, no world as it
once had been.  Still, the Queen was dead.
     As dawn broke over Knothole, it was clear that nobody was
asleep.  Everyone knew what had happened during the night and
they were now outdoors in the cold of the early sunshine,
waiting.
     Inside Sally's hut, she and her sister had spent the evening
preparing their mother's body for burial.  Mobian custom dictated
that only the family perform this rite, so as to put no barrier
between them and their grief.  Even if it meant breaking down in
tears every few minutes, tradition compelled them to perform the
task.
     Once the body had been washed, it was wrapped tight in the
bedsheet.  Sally held her mother's cold face in her hands and
kissed it one last time before it was covered.  Shorter strips of
linen were used to tie the sheet together at the ankles, knees,
waist, below the shoulders, and across the forehead.
     Sally and Sandy each had in their possession a bakhat, a
long black band of cloth wound many times about the waist in such
a way that the ends could be tossed over either shoulder.  For
ten days after the burial of a family member, mourners were to
wear the bakhat at all times.  With this article tied in place,
the two sisters took hold of the body and placed it on the litter
that had been used to bring the Queen into the hut.  Someone had
left a quilted comforter on the porch, and this was draped over
the body; this was the most fitting pall they could find.  Then
the two sister began to bear the body to its final resting place.
     Outside, they passed the Knothole freedom fighters, gathered
silently in two rows to watch the body pass by.  As the
sisters walked past, the mourners formed a line behind the body,
moving in solemn procession.  Rotor stood with cap in hand and
with his head bowed.  Sonic saw Tails standing next to him and
looking up at the hedgehog with pleading eyes.  Sonic guessed at
Tails' unasked question and gently said: "Hey, it's cool to cry." 
And as Tails did so, Sonic did something he hadn't done since
Tails was a cub: he picked up the heartbroken fox and cradled him
in his arms.
     As Sally and Sandy neared the grave site, there was a
rustling of the bushes nearby.  They parted, and into the
clearing stepped Lupe' and the other members of the Wolf Pack
freedom fighters.  As they did so, they each dropped to one knee
as the body passed by.  Bunnie smiled, glad that her message to
Lupe' had reached her in time and that the Wolf Pack had been
able to come.
     At the grave, the ceremony continued in silence.  Sally and
Sandy each unwould the bakhat from around their waist and slid it
under the body.  With these they lowered the body of Queen Alicia
into the ground, thus recalling the ritual item's origin.
     There was nothing more for Sally and Sandy to do.  Custom
dictated that theirs was not the task of filling in the grave. 
That was left to the others who, one handful of dirt at a time,
solemnly buried their Queen.  As they did, many of them came over
to Sally and embraced her.  The Wolf Pack let out a mourning
howl.  And Antoine, wearing his finest dress uniform, stood
saluting at the graveside, his body at rigid attention except
that his shoulders heaved with sobs and his face was contorted
with grief.  He was torn between duty and emotion, and Sonic
later said it made him look ridiculous.  "Ah know," Bunnie said,
"and that's what made it so sweet."  Few noticed it at the time,
but there was a calmness about Sandy, a serenity that was not at
all reassuring.


     Bunnie was taking a big chance, but she quietly rapped on
the door of Sally's hut.
     Nothing had been seen of Sally or Sandy since the burial
earlier that morning, for custom dictated that the family go into
seclusion for a day and a night.  Still, Bunnie felt she had to
talk to someone, and could think of no one better than her best
friend.  When there was no answer, she slowly opened the door.
     Sally lay in her bed, still wearing her vest and boots in
addition to the black bakhat.  That Sally would have gone to bed
with her clothes on was unusual enough.  She was half-curled in a
fetal position, and her face was still streaked from tears
recently shed.  She breathed in the steady rhythms of sleep. 
Nicole sat on the nightstand next to her, open and with one light
blinking.
     There was no point in waking her up, Bunnie thought.  The
physical and emotional exhaustion of the last few days had
finally caught up with her.  Bunnie gingerly started to pick up
Nicole to shut the case.
     "DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?"
     "Shhh!" Bunnie whispered.  Nicole repeated the question at
half-volume.
     "What was she doin'?"
     "SALLY HAD REQUESTED A PLAYBACK OF ORAL HISTORY FROM THE
ROYAL ARCHIVES: QUEEN ALICIA'S DESCRIPTION OF HER CHILDHOOD IN
THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES.  DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?"
     "That's OK, Nicole.  Just...uh...just mark the spot and
she'll get back to it."
     Bunnie shut the lid and was about to set Nicole down on the
table when she noticed a piece of paper stuck to the back of the
door.  It was written in an alphabet that was foreign to her.  It
was then that it occured to her to look around the hut again.
     Sandy was nowhere to be seen.
     Taking the paper down from where it had been tacked up, she
quietly left the hut and the still-sleeping Sally.
     Bunnie wondered what to do with the letter.  She couldn't
show it to Uncle Chuck because Dulcy had taken him back to
Robotropolis a short time ago.  He said he'd wanted to get back
and search Robotnik's computers to see if there was any more
information they could yield on deroboticizing technology.  Sonic
hadn't wanted to see his uncle go back to living in Robotnik's
shadow, but Uncle Chuck was firm: "Sonic, we're not just fighting
against Robotnik anymore: we're fighting against time."
     A shadow passed over Bunnie and she looked up.  It was
Dulcy, getting ready to land.  That meant anything could happen.
Then Bunnie noticed that Sonic was seated on a nearby tree stump,
his chin resting on his hands.  He appeared to be in Dulcy's
landing path, but was too depressed to notice. 
     Before Bunnie could say anything, Dulcy hit the ground and
skidded to a halt just inches away from Sonic's sneakers.  The
hedgehog didn't move.
     "Hey, Dulc," he said listlessly.
     "Hey, Sonic.  I got Uncle Chuck back OK."
     "Yeah, swell."
     "Hey, Sonic," Bunnie called out now that it was safe to walk
toward him, "you seen Sandy anywhere?"
     "Isn't she with Sal?"
     "Nuh-uh.  Sal's all by herself.  But Ah DID find this," she
said as she produced the handwritten note.  Sonic studied it for
a second.
     "I give; what's it say?"
     "How the hoo-ha should Ah know?"
     "Hey, maybe Nicole can read this."
     "Oh mah stars, Ah completely forgot!  Ah've still got her." 
She gave the handheld computer to Sonic, with whom Nicole was
on "speaking terms."
     "Yo, Nicole!  Front and center!"
     "SONIC...WHAT UP?"
     "Can you read this?"  He held the note up close to Nicole.
     "SCANNING NOW."  A second later, a torrent of consonants was
coming out of Nicole's speaker.
     "Yikes!  Nicole, you flip a chip or what!?"
     "SORRY...MY MAIN HEDGEHOG...YOU SAID TO READ THE LETTER, AND
IT'S WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE NOMADS."
     "Well, then just give me a translation; something *I* can
relate to."
     "YOU GOT IT."  There was a pause of several seconds.
     "'YO, SAL.  IT'S PAYBACK TIME.  I'M TAKING ROBOTNIK DOWN,
AND SINCE I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE, I'M GOING DOWN WITH
HIM.  I'M OUT OF HERE...FOREVER.'"

That's what i wuz refering to...Nicole:"Ironlocke prison,  built in 1543,
 abandoned 100 years ago"  Of course, if the King was really in the
 void for the whole 11 years, how could he have been in the prison
 in the first place? As I said, you've got to make a separation between 
all the different stories...including 1st and 2nd seasons!

   on the T.V., I go into the next room and read a good book.***

   According to the timeline, Naugus went in first, I don't know when.  Then
Robotnik threw the King in in 3224, just before the war began.  Then, in the
present (3235), Ari (sp?) was knocked in.  In the same year, Sally and Bunny
were brought in.  Sonic jumped in to save them, but ran out with everybody.
 Only Naugus and the King were in for too long, for some reason they would
turn into crystal if they were outside the void for too long.  So now they're
both back inside and everybody else is okay.

   Wait up.  Just beause it was built a long time ago doesn't mean 1500 years
passed between the seasons.  It just means it's REALLY old.  If I, in 1995,
ask somebody about the Model T, they would say it was invented in 1908.  That
doesn't mean 87 years passed between the time I asked them and right now as
I'm typing this.
   Because it was abandoned 100 years ago is no different.  The car expert
would say the Model T stopped being produced in 1928, i.e. it was "abandoned"
75 years ago.  It had an effective "life span" of 20 years.  Ironlock had a
life span of 1581 years.  (Assuming the episode took place in 3224.)  That's
a long time, yes, but says nothing about the time between the two seasons.

So you're saying the prison wuz in use for over 1500 years?  Even the
best built stone/wood buildings would'nt even come close to that record...
and since this is a prision, it would have to be in tip-top shape (to prevent
escape of prisoners)...logically, there must be a large time-gap of some
magnitude...
On the other hand, maybe it WUZ in use for 1500+ years...  
That doesn't make much sense to me, but believe what you want.

I received Issue #2 of the Princess Sally mini-series in the mail on 21
March, but they didn't send #1 with it.  I also got #22 at the same time
(which I already had), and I hope I won't have to wait a whole month from
now to get #23.  (As you might have guessed, I took out subscriptions so
I won't have to make a monthly 5-store circuit to find the comics.)

The remainder of this message has information about what's in Sally #2.
If you have not read it and would prefer to read it first, don't read
any more of this message.

Erich Schulman (KTN4CA)
Team OS/2































The story opens with a fight between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally
gives Hamlin a scolding.  To reach the third, undestroyed substation,
the Freedom Fighters use a new(?!) technology:  hang gliders.  Arlo's
glider is hit by the defences and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.

Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod, and
everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon leaving,
they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says they will
return to camp without them (which Hamlin is opposed to), and they
never show up again.

Did you ever have your doubts about St. John after reading #1?  If
so, your instincts were right.  That night, St. John replaces Sally
with a lookalike robot and delivers the real Sally to Robotnik.

Unresolved issues:
* What did happen to Arlo and Penelope?
* Why did St. John sell out?  What compensation is he expecting?
* What will become of Sally?

Reader letters
==============
Actually, *letter*, as only one was published.

Q1: Is Sally going to marry Sonic?
A1: "Could be"
Q2: Has Sally met Knuckles?
A2: (Not yet???) She will in a forthcoming S&K 48-page special
Q3a: Does Sally have a mother?
Q3b: If so, what does she look like?
A3: "Of course I do.  Her origin may yet be told."

Hi.

I know that I asked for something similar before, but your replies didn't  
help me much:

        Could someone please tell me a _newsserver_ that can be reached
        via _SMTP_ and that carries the _alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog_
        newsgroup?

I have no use for TELNET server or something like that because I want to  
have the group on my local server and my system administrator said he  
couldn't connect to any of the servers people told me about so far.

Any help _highly_ appreciated.

Best wishes

I don't know if this was answer because i'm just now getting to my mail BUT.
The reason ari didn't start to turn into crystal is that he was not in there
very long. If you remember blast to the past part 2, the king was sent into the
void right after the take over. That would mean that he was in the void for
over 10 years and naugus was in there longer then that while ari may have been
in there for only a few months. It may take 10 years or 5 years before you can
no longer survive outside the void. Something to think about.

A predator must be swift and agile...

	About three minutes later, David compiled all the information
he could find regarding faster-than-light travel.  According to
the library data, the theoretical and practical principles had
been under extensive study for a period of twenty years.  During
the Great War, the world's prime physicists performed extensive
research on the prospect of FTL propulsion.  The work was funded
by many of the governments on Mobius, in the hopes that some
people would survive by leaving the planet for a new home if
Mobius was destroyed.  The day never came, but the research
continued on for two years after the war had ceased.  After that
time, the research had been terminated.  No specification of the
reason, but David knew the answer.
	The basic aspects of a FTL apparatus (informally dubbed "warp
drive") had many advantages to it.  It allowed a ship to travel
faster than c;  while preventing the total, simultaneous
consumption of the two selected power reactants:  matter and
antimatter.  The premise involved controlled alternations in
phase between "realspace" and "warpspace" for no longer than a
very short span in time, insuring that the ship would never be
at c.  If the ship did come to the speed of light under a warp
field, the ship would create a space/time distortion, appearing
in all points in the universe.
	Countless systems were involved to insure that the ship would
operate without endangering itself and its crew.  An integrated
computer controlled many of the ship's functions, either
autonomously or with crew assistance on the critical systems.
Navigational deflectors protected the ship from lethal
interstellar particle drag, both in sublight and warp space.
Low-level shielding safeguarded the crew and delicate hardware
from the radiation in space.  These and many other aspects made
the ship like a living organism.
	There were severe flaws in the technology that David wished to
emulate.  For one, warp engine engagement inside a significant
gravity field was detrimental to both the ship and the object.
If a ship did so in the gravity environment of a planet, the
planet and ship would be destroyed.  Another problem involved
the sheer volume of the drive mechanism itself.  Unless David
dramatically grew to a gargantuan size, utilization of such a
propulsive device would be impossible for him to personally
implement.  In short, he needed another method based on the
interstellar warp drive, something that would produce a similar
result but would be safe and of the right volume.  Then the
gravity of the situation dawned on him.  Literally.
	David started the physics program in the computer, then entered
complex equations as he double- and triple-checked them in his
cognitive center, contemplating the use of the gravity field
generated by a planet to provide both the warp reactants and
permit secure FTL travel without creating unnecessary danger to
himself and Mobius.  Five seconds later, the proposed warp drive
plus the necessary protection hardware and power feeds came
together on the video display.  He revised and recalculated the
basic design for another fifteen seconds, allowing for the
interaction of his body motion and its effect on the warp field.
 The end result:  a dynamic geometry graviton warp drive.
	Satisfied with the product, David downloaded the required
information via his optical sensors to his growth protocol
circuitry.  He and his relative both viewed the visible
alterations that David made on his body.  The task began first
inside his tails.  They deflated in volume about 20%, regaining
their original size, as the millions of interconnected computers
in his compuorganic brain calculated and recalculated the final
required mass/volume ratio for the warp nacelles and his organic
muscles.  Two blue slits formed on each tail, running parallel
to the tail's axis, for about 75% of each tail's length.  The
tails retained their flexibility, while acting as rotors and
warp nacelles, effectively designating (by design) the tails as
rotor/nacelles.  After the external modifications, David grew
the internal warp drive and power feeds to the rest of his body,
plus an antigraviton generator (for the warp drive reaction
chamber and navigational deflector).
	Beside the tail bases, David added two vent slits for his
impulse drive.  This would allow him to maintain the ability to
utilize realspace velocities up to c, should the situation
permit or require him to do so.  He then followed up with the
internal construction of six micrograviton generators (non-warp
propulsive), to provide power, realspace travel, and graviton
generation for uses other than propulsion (in the event that
another of his upgrades would require it).
	In his chest area, David reallocated space to his organic and
sensor components to allow space for the navigational deflector.
 It lay under his skin, unexposed compared to the external
evidence of the impulse vents and warp nacelle slits.
Microvents formed around the navigational deflector emitter,
permitting unhindered access for gravitons to the G/AG warp
reaction chamber.
	"Uh, David," Tails inquired, "you're not going out like that,
are you?"  He indicated the exposed areas on his tails and
posterior.
	"No, I'm not about to," he replied to his vulpine familiar.
"This is merely for the time when the warp or impulse drives
will be in use.  They will be concealed when they are not."  As
if to prove the point, flaps of protective metal shell covered
with organic overlay veiled the evidence.  "Now for the
evaluation phase.  I believe that the Great Plains will be
sufficient for the experiment."

	After surveying the Great Plains near the Great Forest, David
found a treeless area which would allow him to engage his warp
drive without the risk of destroying foliage.  Motioning to
Tails to maintain a discreet distance, he began the warp
engagement procedure.  Setting his tails parallel to the ground
and bracing himself for the dramatic change in velocity, he felt
the differential graviton field increase in strength...
	And displace him from the ground.  'Very well, then,' he
thought to himself, 'I will have to engage the warp drive while
in flight.'  He calculated what the final radius of the warp
field would be so that he could format a baseline for minimum
height above ground.  The projected result was two meters, so
for safety purposes, he preset the minimum height for 2.5 m and
engaged the NOE (Nap of the Earth) dynamic subroutine.  While he
was correcting his required delta-h from the ground, he
monitored the audio level generated from his nacelles.  'They
are at 90% of maximum power for warp one insertion, so the
maximum level should be thirty decibels,' he considered.
Excellent, since that indicated that the noise reduction
programs responsible for reshaping the graviton warp field were
performing perfectly.  With a five decibel increase from the
transition from realspace into warp, that meant the total
emitted detectable audio would be 35 dB.  One flash of blue
light from the nacelles, and he was somewhere else.
	He circled Mobius 15,000 times in less than a second, and then
returned to his position of origin.  "Tails," he called to his
brother, "how audible was that?"
	"I couldn't really hear it," he answered.  "It was almost like
you didn't use it.  I could barely hear the blast right before
you took off."  He had confirmed David's analysis of the noise
reduction software.
	"Fantastic.  Now for the other experiments.  On to weapons
control."

...must be able to strike hard...

	On a granite rock, located on the cliff surrounding much of
Knothole, were a set of twenty peaceful tin cans.  With target
markers painted on them.  A beam of intensely focused energy
flashed to each can, striking in the center of each target
marker.  The violated metal vaporized and sheared, each can was
forced to the ground by the persuasion of the energy beam.
	"All right, David!" Tails exclaimed after the carnage had taken
its course on the entire target set.  "You hit them perfectly.
It works!"  Looking toward David quizzically, he inquired, "What
exactly is it?"
	"This," David returned, indicating the finger responsible for
the outburst of radiation, "is a phaser emitter.  And what you
saw impact those tin cans was phaser energy."
	"Isn't that like a laser?" his brother wondered.
	"Somewhat similar," the other responded, "but much more
powerful than a laser.  Barring the complex technical terms,
what makes a phaser different from a laser, is that a phaser
undergoes a phase transition before it is emitted from a source;
unlike a laser, which is merely generated and fired.  The phase
alteration creates a much more energetic energy beam than a
laser of identical power."
	A noise came from Tails' abdomen.  "Ooops, excuse me.  I guess
I'm kinda hungry."  Looking at his watch, the time was 1230
hours.
	"I would tend to agree with you, Tails," David consented.  "I
could conceivably continue without further food intake until
approximately 2200 hours;  however, since my new organic and
computer systems are still attempting to adapt to the new
components and energy demands, I could stand to consume
something significant."
	The vulpines flew off toward Knothole and nourishment, after
bagging the now-mutilated cans and locating the recycling
container for tin.

* * *

...but most of all, must never underestimate the prey.

	David experimented with the graviton focusing software (for
non-propulsive events), attempting to find a use for the reserve
energy he had in the micrograviton generators.  As he paced by
the cliff by himself, a twenty-ton sandstone slab somehow
separated from the rest of its bed.  David saw the steadily
increasing darkness surrounding him, looked up to view the rock
which was accelerating from the gravity pull...
	And it was deflected away from him about two meters above,
causing a momentary flash of Cerenkov radiation as the induced
spatial distortion difference between the shield and the rock
dissipated.  Belatedly pondering the significance of utilizing a
graviton repulsor-based shield, he added the permanent emitter
components for dispersing the graviton field.  Without it, he
would have most certainly at least been severely injured, if not
perpetually deactivated.

	Later, David thought of how to utilize the excess metal from
the reconstruction in his skeletal frame.  His thoughts traveled
back to something he saw earlier in the day, something regarding
a particular fish that used part of its endoskeleton to defend
itself.  He tried diffusing the excess metal into his skin and
hair.  Twenty seconds later, a perfected subroutine for armor
had been written.  David was prepared to defend himself as well
as attack.

* * *

	Back in their hut at 2300 hours, David and Tails found
themselves depleted, but satisfied from the past day.  Today had
turned out to be a very productive one for David, and his
brother and comrade was pleased to see that David had taken a
turn for the better.  Not too long ago, the black and gray
vulpine was depressed, due to the system hardware/software
failures that he had little or no control over.  Now, he was in
control of an innovative body that he designed, with the added
security that he could continue to add new components to it.
	"Boy," Tails said, yawning, "it's really been a long day."
	"Yes, that it has," his significant other concurred.  "Before I
forget, I need to reinitialize my integrated system, to allow my
DNA to have the required data to repair or replace the
components should the requirement arise."
	"OK, David," his red companion responded, "I'll close my eyes
for this, since I'm about ready to drop dead anyway," he said,
chuckling.  He climbed up into his bed, covered himself, and
positioned himself away from David.
	David then exploded in a flash of light, permeating some of the
darkness outside, and then returned to his default luminosity as
the DNA restructured and configured itself.  With a sudden wave
of dizziness, he fell into his bed, knowing that there would be
many more projects to attend to.  As for now, they would have to
be done...tomorrow.

Temporal Notice:  The story takes place approximately 4.5 weeks
after David's activation, about a week after Tails and David
became brothers by Knothole Law.  Refer to "My Brother's Keeper"
for background details.

	Saturday morning at 0630 hours was one of dazzling beauty for
the denizens of Knothole.  The solar system's star exhibited an
excellent act around this time of day, some say specifically for
Mobius.  The eastern sky exploded into a shower of colors along
the sky, displaying all the primaries and further in the visible
light spectrum.  The shower of light continued its advance
gradually toward the west, forcing the darkness from its
stronghold back toward the other time zones in the west.
Although most of the play in the stage of the sky was partially
obscured by the branches and the leaves of the tree covering and
surrounding Knothole, there were small panoramas in some areas
that permitted the actors to be seen as the colors intermingled
and separated in complex patterns.  Views like this allowed the
Freedom Fighters of Knothole to enjoy waking up at this time of
day.  All except one Freedom Fighter in particular.
	Normally, David wouldn't be in such a somber mood, in perfect
contrast to the gaiety of the day.  He had much to appreciate,
for he had accomplished much over the past four weeks as a
compuorganic vulpine.  For starters, he had become comrades with
the rest of the Knothole residents in general, his most
important and recent acquirement being Tails.  After a legal
settling held by Princess Sally, plus overwhelming support from
the rest of Knothole constituents, David and Tails were brothers
by Knothole law.  By mutual agreement between David and Tails,
the two foxes decided to live together in Tails' hut.  The
vulpines received a bunk bed courtesy of Rotor, and recognizing
David as a kindred inventor, the walrus permitted David the
privilege of collecting whatever raw materials he needed from
Rotor's junk equipment shed.  The compuorganic fox replaced or
installed many of the computers in Knothole by permission with
ultramodern-designed units, including the computers in Sally's
hut, the observatory, Reconstruction Hall (formerly the War
Room), and of course, his and Tails' hut.  Sally even allowed
him to modify Nicole's circuitry, and she received a faster,
more efficient computer in the process.
	Aside from the external accomplishments, David kept his nanites
and circuits (electronic and organic) under intensive labor for
improving and designing the complex proactive conjunction of
systems that formed his physical and mental matrix.  Over a
short period of time, he complied a massive level of data for
his behavior subroutines, allowing him to interact with the rest
of the Freedom Fighters on a personal level.  The
positronic/organic clock speed and instruction execution level
increased geometrically by every second.  His organic/electronic
visual circuitry gradually expanded their encroachment into the
electromagnetic spectrum, progressing beyond IR and UV.  These
and other countless upgrades were a source of personal pride to
David.  Yet with all these achievements, the compuorganic
vulpine was still troubled on what would otherwise be an
delightful day for him.  In his place as a symbiotic marriage
between computer and organic systems, he had a unique look on
life that made him a honored Knothole member.  But he maintained
the mannerisms of a perturbed black and gray fox on this day,
for reasons that only he had awareness of.  His mind reviewed
the events of the past day:

	Yesterday morning, David was occupied in a conversation with
Sonic, for the purpose of analyzing his terminology and behavior
associated with his speech.  He attempted to mimic the
hedgehog's jovial attitude and language in order to find ways to
integrate them into his own developing styles, then a cascade
failure occurred in his universal translation language subunit
processor that rapidly extended into the other integrated
terminology system routines.  No audible sound emitted from his
mouth as he fell to the ground, convulsing as if he had an
epileptic attack.  He became unconscious before his impact with
the ground.  He awoke five minutes later in Rotor's workshop on
a improvised cot, finding many of his friends standing around
him, concerned for his welfare.  He explained to them that it
was a failure in one of his language subroutines that caused the
disaster, and assured them that the situation was under
stringent control.  Reluctantly, they released him from the
makeshift cybernetic/organic medical facility, thinking that
this would be the final encumbrance that David would face.
	David was wrong in his assumption.  For later in the day, when
the sun had completed its decent into the west horizon, David
was deep in the Great Forest for the purpose of essaying his
extended optical sensor array.  Without any warning, everything
except his visible light spectrum detection grids deactivated
simultaneously.  Unable to detect any recognizable forms in the
blackness, he engaged his electromagnetic navigation array.
That system crashed one second after he activated it.  He groped
around in the darkness for about two hours before Dulcy managed
to locate and retrieve him.  More scrutiny by his distressed
peers after his return to Knothole.
	As the rest of the day continued, David found many of his
systems either partially or thoroughly disabling themselves in a
random chain, and he had no means to limit or prevent the
effects.  By midnight, 40% of all his operational units were
radically affected.  David had no alternative except to reset
all his critical and minor functions and programs to their
default values, excluding his memory data core and emotional
database, which appeared to be the most stable remaining systems.

	Now the functionally-deprived fox was afraid to even venture
out into public, for the dread that even his default codes would
fall victim to a possibly more dire cascade failures, possibly
leading to fatality.  He was at odds with the obligation of
informing Knothole at large what precisely was creating the
system-wide general protection faults in him.  Then again, it
was more than likely that what he felt was necessary to say to
his associates would only serve to aggravate the anxiety/stress
indicators higher than the level they were presently at.
Everyone had their own notions as to what was gradually
stripping David's modifications from his grasp, but he knew
exactly what the answer to the conundrum was.
	In truth, David's systems were unable to dynamically respond to
his lofty demands.  His projected scope of improved designs were
too much beyond his compuorganic's form to compose and alter
for, since he was designed without consideration to what he
would wish to install by default.  The desire for excellence was
never even anticipated, especially not from David.  To extend
his hopes for functionality far over his predesigned
specifications would only be a lesson in futility.
	A familiar voice from the bed above his called to him.  "Are
you OK, David?" his brother asked, regarding his irritated
facial expression.
	David was unable to retain the truth, knowing that it would
have to be revealed eventually.  "No, Tails, I am not," he
replied to his relative, speaking with his default value
terminology index and modified emotional subroutine, incapable
of cloaking the frustration from his vocalization.  "Nearly all
of my systems are either reset to their initial values, or
disengaged from service."
	"What caused this to happen?" the caring confidant continued.
	David lifted himself from his bed and began pacing across the
floor, going to the ends of the bunk bed and repeating his
determined cadence.  "I committed many severe errors," he began
with a voice close to cracking into uncontrollable weeping.  "I
expected my compuorganic system to be capable of creating and/or
engaging in modifications to my components.  I desired
integrated devices and programs that were ultimately too far
beyond what I was expected to possess.  In the process, I
instructed my nanites to construct those circuits and organic
complexes until they nearly failed.  Critical protection faults
occurred, leading to random cascade failures.  The end result:
deprivation of nearly all the advantages I had."  By the end of
his monologue, he nearly was in tears.
	"Come on, David," Tails said with more reassurance than he
felt, for he knew that his kin was in a severe predicament, and
he didn't have the knowledge of how to confront the situation.
"You'll come out of it, and probably be able to get those
programs back."
	"No," David said determinedly, combating the stream of tears
that threatened to overtake his eyes and failing.  After
re-resonating his voice to a slightly more composed state, he
continued dictating.  "The only alternatives I retain are to
maintain the default values and do nothing to alter
them.....or...."  He stopped pacing, his face contorted with
concentration, due to the intensive data compiling and
resolution.  Tails bided his time for the resulting unspoken
alternative, knowing that David would eventually reveal the
thought to him.  "Or," he finally said, "completely redesign my
system to allow for a broad spectrum of hardware and software
modifications, reinitialize the codes, et cetera."  A new
expectancy arose from his decision, gradually becoming apparent
on his face.  His right arm partially extended, he pointed a
finger toward nowhere in particular.
	His brother examined his face, saw the look of expectancy, and
the particular method that he utilized to point one specific
finger from his right paw off to an undefined point in space.
From the little bits of information that Tails knew about his
vulpine relative, he had enough experience with him to
understand what significance the facial expression and
positioning of the extremity indicated to Mobius at large.
David had found the reprieving point in his trials, and the
decision was final.  He had every intention of surpassing what
Rotor and Bookshire designed him to be, while maintaining the
basic intent of being a Freedom Fighter commander.  Nothing
would force him to deviate from his intended course now.
	"Yet," David spoke again, this time with a thoughtful
atmosphere, "there are a great number of undefined parameters to
take into consideration.  What can I utilize to define my new
compuorganic system?"
	He noticed his personal computer, and walked to the touchpad
keyboard.  Not knowing what to expect next from the developing
situation, Tails followed.  After arriving at the required
position to use the keyboard, David typed in the required
security commands, answered the security coding vocally, and
received access to the servers available in Knothole.
	"Computer," David commanded, directing his request to the small
black tower case, "access the Knothole Library Server.  Download
available on-line book titles only."
	The computer complied with his request.  Less than one second
later, the book titles scrolled down the video display panel.
David pressed the appropriate keys on the video display to
examine the book titles.  The confusion of fastly-scrolled
titles made no sense to Tails, but he knew his brother would
have no difficulty interpreting the blurred wave.  David stopped
when he found a book that piqued his interest.  He pointed it
out to his bewildered relative.  The book was "Profiles of
Mobian Predators".  He lightly tapped the display where the
title was visible, indicating it to the computer.
	"Download the indicated book for information, and display on
wall unit."  He and Tails then walked to the wall unit display,
where they could both have an extended field of view.  "Display
speed, 1024 wps."  The computer scrolled the book down the
screen at the requested speed, and David read through its
entirety in six seconds.
	"Now that I have an approximation of what functions I require,"
David finally stated, "I need to design the basis for my system
frame."
	"Are you sure it's safe, David?" Tails inquired, beginning to
seriously ponder the gravity of the task his vulpine familiar
was about to undertake.
	"The procedure is safe, Tails," the black and gray fox
responded.  "Nothing will be overlooked or considered trivial.
The methods are POTENTIALLY life-threatening, but safeguards
have been implemented to make the risks highly improbable."
	As if to prove the point, David went back to his personal
computer.  Taking position in front of the keyboard, his paws
became a fury of motion as he entered the required codes to
manipulate the replicator, a modified roboticiser unit located
in Rotor's workshop.  After two minutes of entering complex
mathematical codes and programming procedures, David removed a
plastic object from a data access port in his computer.
	"This polylinear chip," he said with unconfined fascination,
"is the key to my artificial evolution.  Now I shall become the
model Freedom Fighter, and have no difficulty upgrading my
components and software."  He inspected the chronometer in the
wall display unit, saw that the time was 0641 hours.  "However,"
he continued, "the passage to an improved form of life requires
energy, and I am currently unprepared for such an endeavor."  A
low, but audible noise originated from his abdominal area,
indicating mutual agreement between his digestive system and
power indicators.

* * *

	After the two foxes had consumed their fill of breakfast, they
traveled to Rotor's workshop for David's improved initialization
procedure.  They checked to see if the hut was currently under
use for another one of Bookshire's and Rotor's projects;  it was
not.  Without further delay, they walked inside, spending five
minutes assessing the preliminary diagnostics on the main
computer and replicator.  Satisfied with the results, David
instructed the main computer to reform him, utilizing the
parameters encoded on the polylinear chip.  Thirty seconds
later, the vulpine stepped into the replicator cylinder, and
disintegrated into a shower of dissociated subatomic particles.
The main computer began its most difficult assignment:
restructuring David without causing a fatality in the process.
Tails waited five minutes while the computer performed its
programmed duties, then saw his brother reappear in the
replicator container, particle by particle.
	He looked significantly different compared to the fox that had
entered the replicator cylinder five minutes before.  His tails
seemed more muscular and powerful, capable of flight for longer
distances, and looked as if they could easily behead a SWATBot
and recycle a Hover Unit in no time at all.  The remaining
section of his endoskeletal frame was covered by a slimmer, but
equally devastating compuorganic overlay.  His cranial
attachment seemed to have decreased in volume at least 5%, from
the reallocation of raw materials to other areas in his body.
The advanced David had been designed.
	Tails was astounded by the renewed black and gray fox that
stood before him.  "Is that you, David?" he demanded for
identification.
	His fox brother quirked his mouth, forming a smile.  "Of
course, who else would I be?" the relative replied, not without
a certain piqued resonance in his voice.
	"Well," Tails began, "it's nice to see that you haven't lost
your sense of humor."  He investigated the schematic diagrams on
the computer.  "What are these empty spaces for?" he inquired.
	"The voids in my body allow for growth of new components.  Now
I have the capability to construct and refine systems without
concerning myself with the threat of multiple cascade failures."
	David's statement was correct, for the re-initialization did
more than refine his more obvious external physical appearance.
His cognitive subroutines, instruction/clock speed, integrated
language routines, reaction timebases, nanites, and countless
other functions had been accelerated and/or rejuvenated.  The
new baselines allowed for new components in the future, which
would soon fill the cavities under his skin.  Now that he had
superseded his original design plans set by Bookshire and Rotor,
David was prepared for nearly anything.
	The revitalized fox stepped out from the replicator cylinder.
"Tails," he said to his brother, "I believe it is time to begin
the next phase of my directed evolution.  It is necessary for me
to exceed conventional velocities, so propulsion is the concern
now."  He stepped over to the main computer, and entered all the
appropriate security access codes for server connection
allowance.  "Computer," he commanded after he was granted
access, "connect to the Knothole Library Server.  Keyword:  FTL
propulsion."

Me too. :) (And definately SMTP, not NNTP-- I'll need to have a feed
tunneled in by mail, just like in the bad old pre-NNTP/Internet days..)

Rat, can you get a $alz newsgate on Sard?  Otherwise if I can arrange
a news-tunnel for myself, I'll add a mailing list to the Majordomo on
Brushtail for anyone to receive the newsgroup through email, with
replies sent back into the 'group (simular to what used to exist for
alt.tv.simpsons).

I have never heard of that. Go ahead and do it on your machine. I don't 
get that newsgroup here anyway.

It's the mail2news & news2mail package that Rich Salz (of INN fame)
is maintaining.  You can get a copy of it by emailing him at
rsalz@uunet.uu.net-- you're not allowed to distribute what he sends
you though (because it's still in beta).

Part 0.

Author's credits, "thank you"s, legal jargon, and whatever else happened 
to enter my head...

Welcome to my first Sonic story.  The plot for this has been in my head 
for quite some time now, but unfortunately I had not seen the show until 
recently, and I did not want to risk contradicting too many details, or 
even write something blatantly wrong.

Le'see, "thank you"s go to the creators of the Sonic the Hedgehog 
mailing list for getting me into this mess :), and to SEGA, Archie, and 
DiC for starting the whole thing to begin with :).

A BIG "thank you" to David Pistone for being kind enough to give me 
access to the cartoon show.  This and future stories would not have been 
possible without it.

Parts of this story are based on my FurToonia adventures as "Tolouse."
Thanks to David "Bookshire" Pistone and Dan "Sonic" Ramos for the 
inspiration.  "Hello"s also go to Todd, Tyro, and whoever else plays 
there that might read this :).

Please send questions and compliments...er...comments to:

Historian's Note:  The conclusion of this story takes place well before 
the time depicted in the cartoon, but after events chronicled in the 
stories "Bunnie Rabbot," and "Tails' Tale."

Okay, enough rambling, on with Part 1...

Tolouse's Story
A Sonic the Hedgehog story

Part 1.

5/13/3224, early evening.
Mobotropolis.

     Jean was nervous.  Tonight was supposed to be a big night.  The 
Great War was finally over, and the King was throwing a celebration to, 
among other things, congratulate the Minister of War, Julian, and 
reappoint him as Minister of Science.  Jean, who was a member of the 
Palace Guard, had been asked, along with several others, to work late 
this evening to watch over the ceremonies.  It was supposed to be a 
joyous occasion, but still, Jean was nervous.  There was something that 
just was not right.  Julian had seemed less than enthusiastic about his 
change of jobs lately, and Jean had felt tension mounting.
     Jean stood his post, looking out over the city, when he noticed 
something that made his heart stop.  A huge fleet of hovercraft, flying 
ships of all shapes and sizes, were headed straight for the palace!
     "Gods of Mobius!" he thought.  "What is that?"
     A few minutes later, he had an answer.  At the same time, all hell 
broke loose.

* * *

     Shirley, Jean's beloved wife and a pretty 25-year-old brown-furred 
fox, was busy scrolling through today's e-mail when the telecommunicator 
buzzed.  She pressed the answer button, and her "handsome fox of a 
husband" appeared on the screen.
     "Hey, honey, how's the---"
     "Listen, Shirley.  Something's happened.  I can't explain it, but 
get out of the city.  Get Tolouse, get the neighbors if you can, but do 
it quickly.  I repeat, GET OUT OF THE CITY!!"
     Shirley saw a look of fear that she had never seen before in her 
husband's face.  "Jean, what is it?"
     "Just do it now!  Julian has gone insane, and..."
     Jean was interrupted by a huge crash behind him, and by a robotic 
voice saying "You are under arrest."
     "GET OUT OF THE CITY, PLEASE!" Jean shouted.  "GET OUT---" and the 
screen went dead.

     Shirley could not believe what she just saw, but she had no reason 
to doubt Jean, especially after looking into his eyes, petrified with 
fear.  She quickly got up from the console and ran to Tolouse's room.
     "Honey, wake up!" she said, but before he could respond she already 
had her 4-year-old son cradled in her arms, and was running out the 
door.
     "Mommy, what's wrong?"
     "No time, baby.  We've got to leave."
     Right as she opened the front door, an immense explosion rocked the 
city.  She looked out and in the distance, she saw the palace, falling 
to pieces.  "Jean!" she screamed.  But there was no time to wonder what 
on Mobius was going on.  All around her, people stared at the palace in 
utter confusion.
     Shirley tried to make her voice as firm as possible.  "Everybody, 
listen!  We've got to get out of here!  My hovercar, now!"
     "Shirley, do you know---"
     "NOW!  Jean said something's happened at the palace, but I don't 
want to be here to find out!  Are you with me?"
     Most of the people who heard her followed her to the hovercar.  
Shirley had been fortunate that Jean got one with plenty of storage 
space to transport the various projects he was always working on.  Now 
it would be a means of escape for many people.
     About 20 bodies were compacted into the storage space when somebody 
noticed something approaching.  "Shirley, we've got company!  Gun it!"
     Shirley looked over and saw a whole army of robot patrollers coming 
up the road, followed by angry-looking hovercraft she had never seen 
before.  The robot patrollers (whom would later be known as the infamous 
SWAT-Bots) were grabbing every person they could and stowing them in the 
hovercraft.  With the doors still open, Shirley maxed the accelerator, 
and the hovercar rose in the air and zoomed down the street.  Down 
below, she could hear the cries of the people, who had seen the robot 
patrollers and now saw her hovercar, begging to be taken.  There was no 
time.  She closed the doors in bitter heartbreak.
     "Mommy?"  Shirley looked down and saw Tolouse sitting in her lap, 
eyes wide and full of fear.  He looked just like his father did.  "It's 
okay, honey.  It's okay."  She did not believe it herself, but she could 
not think of anything else to tell him.
     Right then, somebody screamed, "Shirley!  Look ahead!"
     About 200 feet ahead, several robot patrollers were standing in the 
street, forming a roadblock.  There was no way around them!  Shirley 
knew she couldn't stop now.  She gritted her teeth, closed her eyes, and 
maxed the accelerator.
     A robotic voice said, "Halt your vehicle by order of---"
     WHAM!!
     The hovercar lurched wildly, and several windows shattered, but the 
hovercar remained intact and in the air.  Behind them, the frightened 
occupants heard laser fire, but by some miracle the hovercar made it 
through to the city limits, speeding towards the Great Forest.
     Tolouse was crying, as was several of the occupants of the 
hovercar.  By now Shirley was too dazed to do anything but drive, hoping 
they would reach safety.  Wherever that was.

As nighttime approached, the hovercar sped along through the Great 
Forest.

* * *

     Jean was one of the first citizens of Mobotropolis to be 
roboticized that night.  Julian's (now Ivo Robotnik) coup had been a 
success, and his tyrannical rule had begun.

   I just thought up another explanation of Mobius.  (That's right.  I was
reading a message and it popped right into my head.)  Mobius could be in the
same universe as us, just different Big Bang.  I realized, after talking to
many people, that almost everybody who believes in the Big Bang theory
believes that we are living in the first bang.
   The universe began as an infinitely tiny, infinitely dense, infintely hot
blob of matter, then it exploded.  Soon, gravity will take over and the
universe will pull itself back together and everytbody will die a horrbile,
agonizing death.  Then what?  Then it heats up and blows up again, of course.
 So how many more times is this going to happen?  Infinitely many, I would
think.  (Unless somebody invents a super death ray that actually gets rid of
matter.)  More importantly, how many times has it happened already?  Who
knows?  Until we can actually measure how old matter is, there's no way to
tell.  It could be the first, but then again, it could be any positive whole
number.  For all anybody knows, this could be the googolplexth (?) time the
Big Bang occured.  Or ten raised to the power googolplex.  Or more!  (What's
the third number before infinity?)

   Here's another of mine.  Adam is in it.  Yes, the person I mentioned in
"Nano-Wars."  Ironically enough, the first one I wrote comes last.  This
one's sandwiched somewhere in the middle.
   Adam is a numbat.  (Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything.)  Knuckles is an
echidna, Gabriel is a pangolin, Adam completes the set.  (Hey, I thought it
was a good idea!)

   Williams had to work fast.  He knew if he couldn't react fast enough, it
would all be over.  His fingers reached to different parts of the terminal,
pressing buttons here and there.  A maniacal laugh came from a few buildings
down the street.  He was loosing and had to come back fast.  As he worked,
he tried to keep one step ahead of himself so he knew what to do next and
how to do it.  Finally, it came to him: he was loosing!  He quickly put his
plan into action.  After he was finished, he stepped back from the terminal,
took a sigh of relief, and waited.  A few seconds later, he received a
communication.
   "You are evil!  Evil, evil, evil!  I HAD you!"  It was his friend, Adam,
calling to congratulate him on a game well played.
   "It was a simple procedure, really.  Something to keep for next time."
   "Next time!?!  Next time you won't even have a chance--"
   "You can threaten me on the way back to Wespero.  It's already dark,
let's go."
   "Okay.  I'll meet you at your terminal."  He started to walk down the
street towards Williams' terminal.  It was only a few buildings away.  "So
what exactly did you do?"
   "As I was saying before, it was simple.  I just wrote a short program to
keep checking if I was okay and sent it to some other terminal.  If at any
time I went off-line, it would reactivate my terminal and deactivate yours."
   "So you DID lose!"
   "Uh, uh.  According to the rules, you must be off-line for at least
three seconds to loose.  I believe you're the one who made that rule."
   "Yeah?  Well let's change it."
   "Fine by me."
   "How did you get by my defenses, anyway?  I had so many back-ups you
couldn't even begin--"
   Williams sighed.  "You and your defenses.  You can't rely too much on
defenses.  No matter how good your programs are, there's always a way to get
by them.  All they do is buy you some time.  That's why--"
   "Apparently they almost bought me enough time.  I had you."
   "I'll give you that.  But you could've won a long time before if you had
a better offense."
   Adam met his friend and they began their walk back to Wespero, their tiny
village near the Great Swamp.  "But YOU have the better offense.  You hit me
before I have a chance to attack.  That's why I need a good defense."
   "Then work on speed.  If you hit me first, I'll be working on recovering
which gives you more time to work on better attackers."
   "I guess."
   They walked along a bit more.  Williams waved as a squadron of hover
units passed by.  It landed and deployed its Swat-bots to capture the two
rebels.  They went peacefully.  As they were being loaded into a hover unit,
Adam made an obvious observation.
   "Hey, neat!  A prisoner!"
   Williams noticed it also.  In the corner was a tiny skunk, maybe nine or
ten years old.  They both sat down in the back, but no one said anything
for a while.
   "How did you get caught?" asked the skunk, with a touch of anger in her
voice.
   "We didn't," explained Adam.
   She tried again, this time asking Williams, "How did you get caught?"
   "We're just here for the ride.  When we land, we'll be on our way and
you'll be roboticized and live the rest of your life, which is a long time
since you'll be a robot, blindly obeying any and all orders Robotnik gives
you."
   She was getting impatient.  "Stop joking!  Listen," she started to
whisper, "I've been figuring out how we can escape."
   "Back up," Williams was whispering also.  "First of all, the Swat-bots
can hear us."  He continued in his normal tone of voice, "Secondly,
technically we are 'prisoners by order of Robotnik' or something like that,
but this is our stop and soon we won't be.  Adam."
   Adam took his cue, "Computer, change all the Swat-bots' orders in this
squadron so that they'll let us go."
   As if nothing was wrong, the entire squadron of hover units stopped and
landed.  Williams opened the door and got out.  Adam soon followed.
   "You're welcome to come with us, or you could stay and see if your plan
works."
   She was outside in an instant.  "How did you get them to do that?" she
asked as they all walked away from the area.
   "Simple," replied Williams.
   "Quite," added Adam.  "How did YOU get caught?"
   "I guess I wandered too far away from my village."
   "Can you get there from here?"
   "I think so......but..."
   "But it's dark and it would be better if you came with us?" asked
Williams.
   "Yep."
   "By the way, what might I call you?"
   "Nina."
   "Hello, Nina," bowed Adam.  "My name is Adam Lockard and I'll be your
hero for tonight.  This is my lowly apprentice, Xero."
   "Actually, I, Williams, lengthener of life spans and nullifier of
diseases, taught Adam everything he knows.  Speaking of which, I still need
to teach you more about a good, quick offense.  I've found that--"
   "Excuse me," Nina broke in, "but what are you talking about?"
   "Just a game we play.  Every so often we come here to battle each other
to the death."
   "You come here......to play games?"
   "It's the best place.  Robotnik's the only one I know of who has a huge
network of terminals throughout an entire city."
   Nina still couldn't believe it.  As they walked she got lost in the
conversation again, but absorbed as much as she could.

   They were arriving in Wespero when Kristen saw them coming and ran up to
meet them.  "Where have you been?"  She hugged Williams tightly.  "You never
come back this late!"
   "The game got pretty exciting, he almost won.  We even brought back a
present for you.  Nina, this is Kristen, our obsolete nurse.  Kristen, this
is Nina, a girl we met on a hover unit.  We thought it would be best if she
stayed here for the night."
   "She can stay in my hut," invited Kristen.
   "Done.  I'll see all of you in the morning and we'll figure out what to
do then."  He kissed Kristen good night and then left.
   "I'll be retiring also."  Adam left.
   "And you can come with me."  Kristen led Nina to her hut.

   Nina tried to get to sleep, but could not.  She snuck out of her room and
saw a light on in another hut.  Peeking in through the window, she saw
Williams sitting in a chair talking to someone.  She knocked on the door.
   "What?" called Williams.
   "May I come in?"
   "If you must."
   She did.
   "You can sit..." he looked around his hut, "...anywhere where there's
room."
   She found a place on the bed and started to move some equipment aside.
   "Uh--  Put that--  Never mind."
   She sat down.
   "You couldn't sleep either?"
   "No, not 'couldn't' exactly.  More like 'don't.'  I go to bed after
everybody else and wake up before everybody else.  When nobody else is
around, I work."
   "What are you working on now?"
   "Three or four things.  Controlling other computers, nanites, that
terminal war game that needs a name, and the void."
   "Nanites?  Void?"
   "We have time.  Remember about year ago when everybody got sick?"
   "That happened to you too?"
   "It happened to everybody on the planet.  It was caused by a few
octillion nanites.  I got rid of them all."
   "YOU?  How?"
   "We don't have that much time.  The void is something I found out about
in Robotnik's computer core.  Presumably, it's the gateway to another
dimension.  I'm trying to open it, or at least understand it."
   She thought about what he had said and, remembering what had happened in
Robotropolis, commented, "You're much more interesting than anybody in my
village."
   He smiled.  "I think you'll find that I'm much more interesting than
anybody here, also.  Besides Adam.  He's pretty interesting."
   "Are you two brothers?"
   "Ha!  No.  He's just a friend who escaped the coup d'etat with me."
   "What about......your parents?"
   "Gone."
   "I'm so sorry."
   "It's not your fault.  I'm not sure exactly what happened to them, but
I'm assuming they were roboticized.  If that's so, it's a simple matter of
deroboticizing them.  I just haven't been able to locate them yet.  Which
leads me to believe that they're dead."
   "I'm so sorry."
   "It...is...not...your...fault," he enunciated.  "So, why'd you want to
see me?"
   "Oh.  I couldn't sleep and I saw your light on."
   "So."
   "So I thought we could talk."
   "About what?"
   "I don't know.  You're making this very difficult.  I'm spending the
night in some strange village with people I've never met and everybody's
worried about me back home."  She sounded if she was going to cry.
   "Calm down.  Just go to sleep and everything will be fine tomorrow."
   She nodded and started to get in Williams' bed.
   "No--  What're you--  Fine."  He cleared off the miscellaneous objects
from his bed.
   Nina got into bed, got comfortable, and tried to go to sleep.
   "I'll just sleep in my chair," he told her.  Of course, Williams stayed
up after she finally fell asleep, researching the void.  But he eventually
had to sleep also.

   He woke suddenly to the sound of someone banging on the door.  Strange,
someone actually got up before him.  Williams didn't answer, so it was
opened from the outside.  It was Kristen.  She was breathing heavily and she
spoke fast.
   "Nina's gone!  Have you seen her?  Where'd she go?"
   Williams, half-awake, answered, "Yeah, she's been here all night."
   "What!?!  You didn't tell me?"
   "She came in during the middle of the night, I didn't want to wake you.
Apparently, she wanted to sleep here, so I let her."
   "Next time, tell me!"
   "Next time?  How many more times is this going to happen?"
   Kristen walked over to Nina, sleeping soundly.
   "What are you doing now?  Don't wake her, the sun is just coming up.  Let
her sleep a little more."
   Kristen didn't hear him.  She gently nudged Nina, who woke up startled.
She let out a yelp, but soon recovered.
   "It's morning already?"
   "Not quite," Williams rhetorically replied.
   "Why is everybody up so early?"
   "Ask Kristen."
   "You weren't in bed, I came looking for you," Kristen answered the
question.  "Why did you sneak out like that?"
   "I couldn't sleep, I saw Williams was up so I visited him."
   "You shouldn't run off like that."
   "Well," said Williams, "now that we're all up, let's go."
   "Where?" asked Kristen.
   "To take Nina home, where else?"
   "Now?"
   "Now is the perfect time.  We might be able to get there before anybody
wakes up."  He got up out of his chair and left.
   "Wait up!"  Nina followed him.
   Kristen went to wake Adam up.

   Williams and Nina were waiting as Adam met them outside of the village.
It was early and cold, the wind made things worse.
   "Where's Kristen?"
   "She's not coming.  Said she needed more sleep."
   "Well she's the one who woke everybody up at this ungodly hour.  Which
way?" he asked Nina.
   "I don't know where we are."
   "Then we're going back to Robotropolis.  As soon as you recognize
something and can find your way back, let me know."
   "You mentioned something about derobotization," Nina commented as they
were walking.  "Can you really undo that?"
   "Let's just say that when you can manipulate molecules, you can do a lot
of things."  He didn't want to get into the finer points of changing the
molecular structure of metal to skin.  "And if you can manipulate individual
protons, neutrons, and electrons, you're a god."
   "Why's that?"
   "Because then you can change anything into anything else.  Don't like
pollution?  Then change it into ice cream."
   "Really?"
   "Uh, huh.  And when you get down to quarks..."
   "How do you know all this?"
   "You pick up some things when you hang around a physicist all day."
   They walked some more.  "What about you, Adam?" asked Nina.
   "Huh?"
   "Tell me about yourself."
   "There's not much to tell.  Robotnik took over, I came here with
Williams, the end."
   "What about your family?"
   Adam didn't answer.  So Williams answered for him, "Siblings: none.
Parents: dead."
   "Doesn't anybody in this village have parents?"
   "Kristen has her mother."
   "What's the deal with Kristen?"
   Williams laughed.  "You ask that as if there was something morally wrong
with her."
   "Sorry."
   "You shouldn't be.  You made a joke.  I'm proud of you."  He patted her
on the shoulder.
   "But I insulted your girlfriend."
   "Oh, come on.  THAT was not an insult.  Adam can do better."
   "Of course there's something morally wrong with her," Adam was back in
the conversation, "she likes YOU."
   "See.  That was......  Actually, that was directed at me.  But it was a
good try."
   "Glad to be of service.  Shall I try again?"
   "No, thank you."
   "Do you take anything seriously?" asked Nina.
   "Nope."
   "But your parents are dead.  HIS parents are dead.  You don't find
that...serious?"
   "Nope.  It's just a part of life.  No, wait.  It's a part of death.  But
it's the end of life which means it's a part of life.  But they're not
alive, so it can't be.  Wait.  When does somebody die?"
   Nina thought about it.  "When they're not alive any more."
   "Yeah, that's like saying 'the square root of negative two equals x where
x equals the square root of negative two.'  Of course they're not alive,
that's why they're dead."
   "You should've seen him trying to explain the universe," Adam told her.
   "I DID explain it."
   "Right.  Matter spontaneously popping out of nowhere."
   "It's the only explanation."

   They walked for quite a while.  Robotropolis was pretty close by the time
Nina told Williams she knew where to go.
   "Okay, bye."  Williams began to walk back.
   "Wait!  Where are you going?"
   "Back."
   "We have to escort her to her village," Adam reminded him.
   "You can find your way to your village, right?"
   She nodded.
   "Then you don't need our help anymore.  We'll see you again sometime."
   "We can't just leave her here."
   Williams pulled Adam aside.  "If we take her home, they'll want to meet
us.  They'll ask us where we came from and will want to visit us.  I don't
want to have to deal with another village.  You can go with her if you want
but please, don't bring anybody back with you."
   "Understood."
   "Nina, go home and enjoy life.  Good-bye."  Williams continued walking
back.
   "Just...trust us, okay?"  Adam followed.
   Nina stood there for a moment, deciding what to do.  She could run after
them and get them to take her the rest of the way, but she didn't.  Williams
was right, she didn't need their help anymore.  She wasn't scared of being
caught or getting lost, she just didn't want them to leave.  "You're a very
interesting man, Williams," she thought to herself as she began her journey
back home.

Whoops, it wasn't my intention to sent that to the list..

ObSonic:
"Peters" (i think) Ice-cream here in Australia have just this week
introduced `The Sonic the Hedgehog Mint-flavoured ice cream'. There's
a TV advertising campaign too, starring STH's Sonic and Robotnik.
More details pending when I get the chance to watch the commercial in
its entirety..

(Considering that this is the kind of boost to a character's popularity
that TV executives dream about, can I hope that the 2nd season of STH
will be shown in the near future..?)

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" which will be posted to the fanfic section of
Rotor's homepage when it's completed (the final chapters, 11 and
12) will be posted April 4.

     C. OTHER SOURCES



I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.

The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics

In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a

The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic

The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic

disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.



[I am indebted to R.D.B. for the following, since the Sally
miniseries has yet to hit the shelves in this corner of Michigan-
-I've GOT to stop buying retail and subscribe!]

Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]

"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
COMING SOON

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

Tolouse's Story
A Sonic the Hedgehog story

Part 2.

The next day.
Somewhere deep within the Great Forest.

     The hovercar was dying.  Apparantly the run-in with the robot 
patrollers had caused more damage than they had realized.  Shirley 
wasn't sure how much longer it would run.
     About 20 minutes later, she was sure.  No longer.  The engines cut 
off, and the hovercar plowed into the ground.  Shirley cradled Tolouse 
as everybody was thrown forward by the crash.  Nobody was hurt.  At 
least, not physically.
     Shirley wrestled the doors open, and the 20 or so refugees exited 
the hovercar.  All were scared, most were crying, nobody knew what was 
to happen next.  All eyes were on Shirley.
     "Shirley, tell us, please.  Do you know what on Mobius is going on 
here?"
     Shirley looked at them wearily, holding Tolouse in her arms.  "I 
don't know.  Jean was in the palace when it happened, and he called me 
just before---"  She looked away as a tear rolled down the fur of her 
cheek.  "I don't know."  Then an idea came to her.  "The radio!"
     Shirley got into the hovercar, and switched on the radio, praying 
it still worked.  It did.  The commercial frequencies were nothing but 
static, so she switched to the frequencies used by the Palace Guard.  
She picked up voices on one of the channels.  She fine-tuned it and 
turned up the volume for all to hear.
     A deep, evil voice sounded through the hovercar's speakers.  
"Snively, is it done yet?!"
     This was answered by a higher-pitched voice.  "Yes, sir.  SWAT-Bots 
have travelled through all sections of the city, and virtually all 
citizens have---"
     "Snively, what do you mean by, 'virtually'?"
     There was a hesitation.  "Well, sir, it...appears there were some 
attempts at escape...various reports show that---"
     The deep voice interupted again.  "SNIVELY!!  I *trust* this is 
being taken care of?!"
     "Y-y-yes, sir.  Hover-bots are patrolling the Great Forest for any 
signs of refugees.  I...I promise you, sir, if there are any refugees, 
they will be captured."
     "Good, Snively, good.  Continue."
     A note of relief was heard in the higher-pitched voice.  "Thank 
you, sir."
     Nothing but static afterwards.

     Shirley switched off the radio and looked at the frightened faces 
around her.  She realized they were unsure of what to do, and were 
looking to her for guidance.  She sighed heavily, resting her head 
against the windshield.  Gods of Mobius, what am I to do?
     "Mommy?"
     She looked down at Tolouse.  Although they were still glazed with 
fear, there was expectation in his eyes as well.  She sighed again.  If 
she didn't help them survive, who would?  Like it or not, she thought, 
I've been chosen to get us through this mess.  Lucky me.
     Shirley climbed out of the hovercar and looked around, trying to 
determine what they needed to do.  Ah!  That was it.  She cleared her 
throat, and tried to make her voice sound as confident as possible.  It 
wasn't easy.  "Well...it, uh, looks like we're going to be here for a 
while, and we've got work to do.  We'll need to hide the hovercar, and 
we'll have to dig some burrows to hide ourselves in.  If those 'hover-
bots', whatever they are, are looking for us, we're going to have to 
live underground."
     She studied the ground, then began digging with her bare paws.  
"Come on!" she persuaded.  A few joined her at first, and then 
eventually everybody was helping, even little Tolouse.  Shirley watched 
him, sadly.  Is this how he is going to grow up, without a father, as a 
refugee?  Tears wet the fur of her cheeks.

     By nightfall, the hovercar had been covered over with foliage, and 
they had enough burrows for everyone to sleep in, safely hidden from any 
surveillance above.

     That night, Shirley and Tolouse were awakened by a loud roar.  
Overhead, hover-bots were continuing their search through the Great 
Forest.  Shirley grabbed Tolouse and crawled as far back into the burrow 
as she could.
     "What is that, Mommy?" Tolouse screamed, crying.
     "It's okay, baby, it's okay."  Shirley said, rocking him back and 
forth.  She and the others had been careful to see that the burrows and 
the hovercar were as camouflaged as possible.  Still, she just knew that 
those machines would stop, and any minute they would be flushed out of 
the burrows and taken away.
     It didn't happen.  Soon the roar quieted to a whisper, and then was 
gone.  The hover-bots had moved elsewhere.
     Shirley could not hold it in any longer, and tears flowed as she 
thought of Jean, Tolouse, and what their lives were to become.  
Eventually, sleep returned, and Shirley slumped against the side of the 
burrow, holding tightly onto the sleeping Tolouse.

* * *

And this is how their new life began, as refugees of the Great Forest.

Hi all!
 
I was thumbing through some of the comics the other day, and noticed that
sometimes the characters have four fingers, and sometimes five.  Anyone
know how many they are really supposed to have?  I see in the most recent
issues of the comics, Sonic and Tails have five, but Sally only has four.
Even the pictures on the game boxes are contradictory.  Sonic on the 
Sonic I box has 5 fingers, on the Spinball game he cleary has four. Hmmm....

According to the pilot show for "Bonkers" about  2(?) years ago, toons 
traditionally
have 4 fingers, which is how they discovered a human under all that fire and 
brim-
stone, pencil-pushing, antitoon maniac.  I guess that makes some of the 
characters
fake toons (NOT!)!  Then again, it could be a matter of artistic license.  
Apparently,
Sega of America, Archie Comics, and DiC aren't under all the same rules 
(obviously),
so something probably slipped through here and there where the artists tried 
to give
the toon characters a believable amount of fingers.  Can't imagine what life 
would be
like without an opposable thumb, though I'm somewhat biased by evolution and not
being a furry.  How many fingers do you see?  We may never know.

Tolouse's Story
A Sonic the Hedgehog story

Part 3.

     Time went on, and the small band of refugees did the best they 
could to keep living.

* * *

     The 23 survivors began to pool their knowledge together, and 
slowly, a village was born.  The crude burrows they had slept in the 
first night became a complex system of underground rooms and hallways.  
They learned what plants could be used for food and medicine, and some 
of the people even had hunting skills.  The hovercar had had the 
incredible luck of crashing near a small brook, so water was available 
as well.  It was not the city life they had known, but it was one they 
could live.
     The hovercar's radio provided their only way of knowing what was 
going on.  The hovercar's batteries were soon dead, but luck continued 
to help them, as one of the group fashioned a hand-cranked generator out 
of parts from the hovercar.  By monitoring the Palace Guard and other 
radio frequencies that Jean had had access to, they learned what was
happening to Mobotropolis, and it chilled them to the bone.  Shirley
realized that she would never see Jean again, and her heart broke even
more.

     As the years went on, the refugees' life became routine.  They 
tried to live as normally as they could, but it was in perpetual fear of 
being found.  The slightest noise from above would send everyone 
scurrying underground, and nobody ever dared to venture far from the 
village.  Nobody, that is, except for an energetic, young fox.

     Tolouse was the only child in the group, and he grew up quickly in 
the underground village.  His mother had been hesitant to tell him 
exactly what had happened, but finally, she did.  One night, when 
Tolouse was seven, she sat down with him and explained why they were 
living in the forest, why they were always hiding, and what she was sure 
had happened to Jean.  Tolouse had listened, asking no questions.  When 
she had left his room, he had crawled into bed, but sleep did not come 
until late in the night.  He thought about what his mother had told him, 
and then he thought about his life here and the fear that seemed to
dictate what to do.  Finally, just before sleep came, he became
determined to do something about it.  He didn't know how, but he would
find a way to help them.

* * *

     Nearly nine years after their escape, Shirley and the others 
noticed that the transmissions they were picking up on the radio had 
taken on a new tone.  There was talk of a band of "freedom fighters" 
somewhere in the Great Forest who were apparently putting up a good 
fight for Robotnik.  Shirley could not see how such a thing was even 
feasible, but other villagers cheered the possibility of Robotnik being 
brought down, however remote that possibility was.  Some time after 
these new developments occurred, the transmissions ceased all together.  
It was reasoned that they were probably being scrambled now, to keep 
these "freedom fighters" from picking them up as well.
     Tolouse, who was now 13, had heard about the transmissions, too.  
Almost immediately, he knew that this was his chance to help his mother 
and the villagers, the way he had wanted to do for six years now.  He 
wanted to find this place, this "Knothole" that was mentioned in the 
transmissions.  He wanted to see Robotnik pay for taking his father and 
making his mother fear for her life almost daily.  He wanted to be a 
freedom fighter.

     "You want to *what*?" Shirley asked.
     "Mother, everyday I look around here and I see us living like 
prisoners because of that...jerk, Robotnik.  I want to do something 
about it.  I want to find this Knothole place and help them fight him!"
     "Tolouse, think!  Robotnik has taken over the entire civilization, 
on both continents!  Do you really believe that a small group of people 
can put up a war against somebody like that?  With all his robots and 
technology to back him up??"
     Tolouse looked away in frustration.  "But we're not even trying!  
You won't even let me walk out into the forest on my own.  I'm sick of 
just sitting here when something could be done about it.  Anything!"  
Tolouse turned towards her.  "Mother, I don't want to live like this!"
     Shirley looked at her son.  He was no longer the frightened baby 
she had fled Mobotropolis with, all those years ago.  A tear came to her 
eye.  "How would you even know where to go?"
     Tolouse sighed.  "I don't.  But the more I think about it, the more 
I want to at least try.  Please, Mother."  Tolouse looked into his 
mother's eyes.  "I've got to try."
     Shirley knew that her son's mind was made up.  The tears came 
freely, now.  "Okay, Tolouse.  Okay."  She hugged him as tightly as she 
could.

     The next day, before the Mobian sun had risen, he was gone.  He had 
packed some food and had said one last goodbye to his mother.  Then, 
looking out into the Great Forest, he began walking.

     Shirley spent most of the day in her room, crying.  She had lost 
her husband to the cruelty of Ivo Robotnik.  Now, she feared that she 
had lost her son as well.

What are navigational deflectors used for on the NCC-1701D for?  To 
disperse the micro and macroparticles that would otherwise destroy
the ship.  David has a nav deflector array.

Hello, all.

Does anybody know of any Sonic ASCII art, other than that pic that's in
the FAQ?  I'm hoping to find a pic for most if not all the Freedom Fighters
for a project in FurToonia I'm working on.

Thanx in advance---Kris/Tolouse

I've been meaning to contact DiC and/or ABC to ask, but here's the
scuttlebutt verson:

DiC went ahead and began putting Sonic animation art (cels, etc.) on the
market without checking with Sega Incorporated.  Sega whereupon took
umbrage, words were exchanged, and the show became a victim of the
fighting (can you say "anal retentive"?).

Makes a good story, anyway.

I only obtained Han Lee's ASCII Sonic because I put out a request on
rec.arts.ascii and it got posted.  The poster also said that Lee's Sonic
was the first and the best Sonic she'd seen -- there were others but
they were "pretty lame."

Unless someone figures out how to gray scale pictures of Sonic
characters, I don't hold out much hope.

For anthropomorphisized cartoon characters, 3 fingers and a thumb have always
been preferred, going back to as early (if not earlier) as the 1920's Felix
The Cat animated cartoons and of course Mickey Mouse and friends in the
1930's.  I believe it's preferred for two reasons: one, it's more
aesthetically pleasing to the eyes; and two: it's easier to animate.  We
really, REALLY wanted to have Sonic drawn with four fingers and a thumb in
the Archie SONIC comics, but SEGA wouldn't let us.  They didn't understand
our position, as stated above.

I've not seen any others, but you might want to ask around in the 
ascii-art newsgroups.  And if anyone wants to play around with two 
GIF-to-ASCII converters, just let me know.   You must be able to run DOS 
programs to use them.

I've got a rather impressive collection of graphics tools.  I'm sure at 
least one will convert any color image to grayshades.  I'll double-check 
that later.

Greetings All!

I know its been awhile since I posted, but I'm back!

For those of you who have been screaming at me for a new story (I forgive 
you :>) here is part 1 of "The Experiment".  A story loosly based on one 
of my favorite video games, "Burn: Cycle" for the CD-i system.

Opinions are always welcomed.  Enjoy!

Story:
	A lone shuttle flew through the night skies.  On board, Packbell 
sat in the pilots seat with a grim expression on his face.  He had been 
called back to Robotropolis to perform one of the lowest services anybody 
could be asked to perform, new prisoner orientation.  Normally, when a 
large group of rebels were captured, they were officially charged with 
treason against Robotnik, found guilty and sentenced to the robotizizer 
after an agonizingly long stay in the holding cells.  Normally, a 
Swat-bot was assigned to give the orientation, but, for some reason, 
Packbell had been selected for this duty.  As a First Class Commander, 
prisoner orientation was listed under his job duties, but he was rarely 
assigned it because both he and Robotnik knew there were better things 
Packbell could be doing with his time.
	Packbell sighed as he set the shuttle down in a landing bay.  
Stopping by his quarters to grab his dress cloak, he headed to the 
prisoner orientation chamber.
	The chamber was massive.  It had fifty rows of benches facing a 
raised podium.  Behind the podium was a large screen on which could be 
displayed the many terrible robotization and interrigation recordings 
that were always made.
	Packbell stood behind the podium and waited patiently.  Soon, 
Swat-bots began escorting rebel freedom fighters into the room.  It was 
the typical scene that Packbell was so used to.  Some silent, some 
crying, some glaring at him in defiance, families holding to one 
another.  How pathetic, thought Packbell.  Soon, the entire group was 
sitting in front of him.  He began to speak from the script that sat in 
his memory.
	"As a Commander in the Robotropolis Central Command, it is my 
duty to inform you that you have all been charged with treason against 
the Emporor of Mobius, Ivo Robotnik."
	At those words, some leaped up and began shouting words of 
defiance.  Packbell rarely listened to such nonsense.  The Swat-bots 
quickly silenced them by shooting warning shots over the heads of the 
crowd.  When the crowd quieted down, he continued.
	"Haveing been so charged, you have been tried based on an 
evaluation of your general behavior, and have, consequently been found 
guilty.  You are therefore sentenced to the robotizizer after intense 
interrigation, and a stay in our holding cells until such time as we need 
more worker-bots."
	At this some began trembling in fear, while some still haven't 
recovered from the shock of what was happening.  Suddenly, a raccoon who 
had apparently snapped from the stress, jumped up and made a desprate run 
for the door.  Before anybody could react, Packbell pulled a laser rifle 
and shot three blasts, each of which slammed into the prisoner, throwing 
him against the wall where he collapsed in a lifeless heap.  The 
prisoners stared in shock and terror at Packbell, who was still holding the 
smoking rifle.
	"Anyone else feel like dying tonight?" he asked, placing the 
rifle back under the podium "if so, please feel free to make a run for 
any of the exits provided.  While you're here, there's one thing you need 
to understand.  I care nothing for your futile little lives, and I have 
no reservations about relieving you of each and every one of them."
	He turned to the Swat-bots.
	"Take them away," he ordered.
	As the Swat-bots began to excort the prisoners from the room, 
Packbell suddenly had an idea.
	"Wait!" he yelled.  The Swat-bots stopped where they were.
	In a single sweep of the room, he analized each prisoner 
individualy.  After make delibrate calculations, he arrived at a conclusion.
	"Take the twenty prisoners in the back row to my experiment 
holding cells," he ordered.
	"Acknowleged," responded the bots.
	Packbell was getting tired of experimenting on worker-bots.  Some 
live subjects might just provide some better results.  He doubted that 
any of the prisoners would survive the proccess, but then, that was their 
problem.  Packbell left the prison block and headed for the Scientific 
Research Building.

	Sir Charles Hedgehog was widely know among the resistance for his 
logical attitude and somber manner when it came to getting a job done.  
What was not well known was that a part of him always craved living life 
on the edge, and playing the part of a Freedom Fighter spy deep inside 
Robotropolis was about as close to the edge as one could get without 
falling over completely.  Not that he took the job lightly, he was always 
very serious about it, because if he were ever found out, he'd be 
interrogated and either reprogrammed or sent to the scrap pile.
	Having finished his duty cycle, he quietly slipped away from the 
other worker-bots and went to the his hideout to continue with a few 
things he had to do.  First, however, he sat down in front of his 
computer and tapped into the section were Commanders post their daily 
progress reports to see if anything remotely important had happened.
	As he scrolled down the list, everything appeared to be pretty 
much the same, that is, until he got to Packbell's entry:

REPORT #:548722226-457B
DESIGNATION: PACKBELL
RANK: COMMANDER

SUMMARY REPORT FOR:  3-14-35

1900HRS -- SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURED 165 REBELS LOCATED IN GREAT JUNGLE

2100HRS -- PRISONERS PROCCESSED FOLLOWING STANDARD PROCEDURES

NO OTHER ACTIVITY

END REPORT
AUTHORIZATION: 458-5874412-55

	This is ridiculous, thought Chuck, if this keeps up, Sally won't have
any freedom fighters left to contact even if she does find her father's 
list.
	He connected to the prison block records to check on the status 
of the new prisoners.  Some could be rescued if they were being held in 
the right areas.  Looking over the reports, he noticed something unusual.
The number of new prisoners proccessed was 145.  Chuck stopped and 
thought a moment.  Packbell had reported a score of 165, so someone was 
off by twenty.
	The more he thought, the more Chuck began to worry.  This was the
tenth discrepancy in the records regarding prisoners and worker-bots in 
the last four months, and, in every error, Packbell had somehow been 
involved.
	Chuck realized that something was going on, and he was beginning 
to think that not even Robotnik might know.  Calling a messenger bird to 
him, Chuck dispatched a message to the Great Forest.

	Deep in the Great Forest, in Knothole Village, the freedom 
fighters slept soundly.  The small bird flew, unnoticed, down past 
various huts until it came to rest in the window of the hut belonging to 
Princess Sally.  Sally lay in bed next to the window in a sound sleep.  
The bird began chirping rather loudly until Sally groggily woke up to see 
what the problem was.
	Going to the window, she took the note from the bird and read it 
as the bird flew away.

To Knothole Freedom Fighters,

Prisoners have been disappearing en route between their orientation and 
the prison block.  Suspect Packbell is taking them to an unknown location 
for some purpose.  Request any ideas on what to do.

Respond ASAP

	Sally looked at the clock on the wall.   No matter how serious 
such a problem was, no one was going to have good, suggestive ideas at 
this hour.  Folding the note and placing it on her nightstand, Sally went 
back to bed and would handle it first thing in the morning.

	Packbell walked into a chamber deep in his research center.  In 
the center was a long table with shackles on it.  Above it, hanging from 
the ceiling was a semi-circular piece of metal which appeared to have 
laser scanners attached to it, which could be moved up and down the 
length of the table.  At one end of the room was a large display screen, 
and at the other end was a large set of controls facing the table.
	Packbell went behind the controls and sat down.  Pressing his 
hand to a sensor on the panel, he powered the system.  For a few moments, 
he sat listening as the machine quietly sucked power from the Central 
Power Core to serve his secret, twisted purposes.
	Suddenly, the door to the room opened and two Swat-bots entered, 
escorting a frightened looking badger who they promptly strapped down to 
the table.
	"Greetings, citizen," said Packbell in a voice so friendly, it 
would fool all but the most cautious "You might as well stop struggling, 
you can't leave."
	The badger calmed after awhile and simply glared at Packbell.
	"Now, don't be like that," continued Packbell, still speaking as 
though he were the badger's comrade "Just because you've been found 
guilty of treason doesn't mean that we can't be friends.  In fact, you 
should feel honored that you're here instead of back in the prison 
block.  You see, you have been chosen to take part in an experiment that 
will change the way people think of computers and robotics forever.  
First, however, I despise having to call you 'prisoner' so why don't you 
introduce yourself."
	After glaring at Packbell for a moment, the badger responded.
	"My name's Hugo," he said.
	"Hugo?  Pleased to meet you, I'm Packbell, but you already know 
that," said Packbell, smiling.
	"Now then," Packbell continued "Let's get down to business.  All 
you have to do for this experiment is to lie perfectly still."
	Packbell pushed a few buttons on the panel, as the laser scanners 
began glowing.
	"Oh, by the way," said Packbell "Good Luck."
	The laser scanners came on and shot down onto the badger.  The 
scanners moved down the length of the subject, examining each and every 
inch of him.
	"Preliminary suject analysis complete," the computer reported.
	"Proceed to phase two, neural pathway analysis," ordered Packbell.
	The lasers changed color as they moved up towards the badger's 
head and stopped. They began an intense scan of the badger's brain.
	"Analysis complete."
	"Begin Upload Processing analysis."
	The lasers again scanned the badger.
	"Analysis complete"
	Packbell pushed a few more buttons on the panel.
	"Begin full upload procedure."
	The lasers changed color to red and concentrated all their energy 
on the badger's mind.  On the screen at the far end of the room, was 
displayed a 3-D wire frame model of the badger and an imense amount of 
unreadable information.  All seemed to be going well for the Commander 
and he felt a slight tinge of joy at a possible success.  Suddenly, the 
information on the screen changed.
	"WARNING! NEURAL IMBALANCE DETECTED."
	"What!!" exclaimed Packbell, he joy turning to shock.
	"WARNING! NEURAL PATHWAY COLAPSE POSSIBLE."
	"Shut down the experiment!" screamed Packbell above the noise of 
the alarms that had sounded as he began frantically pushing buttons on 
the panel.  The badger's body began jerking about violently.
	"WARNING!  NEURAL SYNAPSE COLLAPSE IN PROGRESS"
	"WARNING!  SUBJECT VITAL SIGNS FAILING."
	Packbell managed to shut off the system.  Walking over the badger 
on the table, he glared at the still slightly twitching body.  After 
standing there for what seemed like an eternity, he turned and went to 
the comm. panel.
	"Send some bots in here to dispose of the body, and bring me 
another subject in one hour," he ordered.
	Turning off the panel, he walked back to the system controls.
	"I'm going to get this experiment right if I have to kill every 
Mobian on the face of the planet!!!" he declared, and began going through 
the program for the thousanth time looking for bugs.

	The next morning, the freedom fighters met in the war room to 
discuss Uncle Chuck's latest message.
	"The idea that Packbell is kidnapping prisoners for his own 
twisted purposes is a frightening thought," Sally was saying "We've got 
to find out what he's doing with them.  any ideas?"
	"Just the obvious one, Sal," responded Sonic "Jam to Robotropolis 
and find out."
	"Sonic, you know we can't go running to Robotropolis without a 
solid plan.  We don't even know exactly what we're looking for," Sally said.
	She turned to Bookshire.
	"Have you had any luck locating info on this, Bookshire?" she asked.
	"Not much," he admitted "Packbell has always suspected that 
someone's been sneaking into the Core so he code-locks all his personal 
files.  I'm examining other areas to see if he forgot something, but 
it'll take time."
	"Well, until we have a better idea of what's happening, there's 
not much we can do," said Sally "Bookshire will continue work on on the 
computer system, but it might be a good idea to send one or two of us to 
Robotropolis to follow Packbell and see what he's up to."

	Later, deep in Robotropolis, Bunnie and Sonic, both having 
volunteered to follow Packbell, arrived outside the main Command Center.  
After avoiding the guards, they managed to sneak inside through the 
ventelation system.  After taking many turns and searching many rooms, 
the team lucked out when they found Packbell.  He was in the main control 
room with Robotnik.
	"You still haven't answered my question," Robotnik was saying to 
Snively "Why are there prisoners missing from my holding cells!"
	"I really don't know sir," responded Snivelly weakly.
	"Don't give us that!" said Packbell "Do you have any idea how 
hard its been for me to capture these tratiors lately.  I've gone through 
a lot of trouble to get them and you lose them!"
	Snively glared at Packbell.  He knew that Packbell was at fault, 
but, with all the trust Robotnik had invested in his finest creation, he 
would never believe it.
	"I'll keep looking into it sir," Snively said rather lamely.
	"You do that," said Robotnik "If you don't find out what happened 
to them, I'll give you to Packbell for target practice!"
	"Yes sir," said Snively, as he turned and left.
	"Why do you keep him around, sir?" asked Packbell.
	"You know, sometimes I honestly don't know," responded Robotnik.
	"Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do," said Packbell.
	"Of course," replies Robotnik.

	Packbell, walked from the room and out onto the side walk.  As he 
walked down the deserted street, Sonic and Bunnie followed close behind.  
They followed him to a small building.  AS he entered, Sonic and Bunnie 
stopped outside.
	"Okay," said Sonic "I'm going to folow him in.  You stay out here 
in case he comes back."
	"You got it suger-hog," said Bunnie.  She crouched in a dark 
corner of the street as Sonic went into the old building.
	Sonic crept down the corridor.  He looked around, but saw no sign 
of Packbell.  He contiued down the corridor, certain that he'd catch up 
to Packbell eventually.

	Bunnie waited patiently behind a garbage can for Sonic or 
Packbell to emerge.
	Suddenly, without warning, a metalic hand shot out of the 
darkness behind her, grabbed her by the back of her neck and lifted her 
easily off the ground.
	"Scream and die, rabbit," said a chillingly familiar voice.  The 
arm turned her around and she found herself face to face with Cmdr. 
Packbell.
	"Did you really think you could sneak up on someone with a 
proximity detector?" asked Packbell, smiling.
	Without answering, Bunnie drove her robotic foot into Packbell's 
chest.  The Commander was unmoved.
	"Such is the advantage of dent-proof alloys," continued Packbell 
"Now, why don't we go find your friend."
	Keeping Bunnie in a tight grip, he returned to the building.

	Sonic had searched the entire building and found nothing.  As he 
returned to the entrance, a figure appeared in the doorway.
	"Greetings, hedgehog!" said Packbell "I believe this belongs to you."
	Packbell held Bunnie firmly in his right hand.
	"Let her go, metal head!" ordered Sonic as he prepared to rush 
the commander.
	"I wouldn't do that if I were you," remarked Packbell "Your 
distance from me is such that you could never get to me in time to 
prevent me from breaking this beautiful rabbit's neck.  Now, I suggest 
you stay where you are unless you believe taking me down is worth your 
friend's death."
	Sonic stopped where he was knowing that Packbell was right.  
There was no guarantee he could get to Packbell in time to save Bunnie.
	"What do you want?" asked Sonic.
	"Just the two of you," Packbell replied "I've sent a transmission 
to my team at the Research Center informing them you are on your way.  
You will go there and allow them to escort you to a special cell I made 
just for you.  If you have any ideas of doubling back, just remember that 
all I need is to hear your sonic boom and Bunnie is as good as dead.  Now 
go."
	Sonic wanted nothing more than to rip into Pakbell and tear him 
apart, but his logic finally won out.  He moved past Packbell and ran off 
towards the center.
	"You're friend appears to be a very reasonable person," Packbel 
remarked to Bunnie as they started for the center.
	"You'll never get away with this," said Bunnie defiantly.
	Packbell smiled.
	"Well, well, another satisfied member of the cliche of the month 
club," he said.
	In a lightning move, he shifted his grip on her neck, robbing her 
of her conciousness.  He continued walking towards the Research Center 
where his experiment awaited.

	Arriving at the Center, Packbell proceeded directly to the 
holding cells where Sonic sat in a cell guarded by ten Swat-bots.  Still 
keeping the unconcious Bunnie in his grip, he gazed at Sonic through the 
force field.
	"What's the deal, Packbell," demanded Sonic "What have you been 
doing with these 'extra' prisoners?"
	"That isn't your concern at the moment.  However, you'll find out 
soon enough," said Packbell "It was a tough decision, but I have decided 
that you will be the next subject for my experiment."
	Packbell pushed a button on the wall.  Suddenly, Sonic cell was 
filled with sleeping gas.  Sonic collapsed to the floor.  Packbell turned 
to one of the bots.
	"Take the hedgehog to the chamber," he ordered.

	As Sonic began to wake, he realized he was strapped tightly to a 
long metal table in the middle of a large room.  Looking around, he saw 
Bunnie in the tight grip of a Swat-bot while Packbell began to power the 
machine.  Sonic struggled to break free, but something was holding him in 
place.  Watching him struggle, Packbell grinned.
	"Force fields are wonderful things aren't they," he remarked 
"Just relax.  I've worked out all the bugs this time so there shouldn't 
be any problems.  Granted, thats what I thought the last five times I 
tried it, but this time I'm sure."
	"Is that what you do with those prisoners?" demanded Bunnie "You 
experiment on them?"
	"Of course," answered Packbell, casually "The worker-bots just 
weren't delivering the results I had hoped for.  They kept having neural 
breakdowns and had to be scrapped.  Some saved me the trouble by 
exploding.  Very intersting effects, but they were setbacks just the same."
	"You're insane, Packbell," yelled Sonic.
	"Yeah, and you're fast.  Do you think I care?" stated Packbell as 
the system powered up.
	THe system indicated it's readiness.  Packbell paused for a 
moment and gazes at Sonic, lying strapped to the table.
	"See you in infinity," he said, simply.  He flipped a switch on 
the panel.
	Later, that was the last thing Sonic remembered. . .

Hello y'all!

I'm working on a personal web page here at UT-Austin.  It doesn't have
much right now, but I'm gradually conglomerating knowledge about how
HTML works, so I'll see about getting more proficient and geting more
on there.  Speaking of which, I formally request all of those who have web
pages and/or FTP sites related to Sega and/or a certain little blue hedgehog
to send me their addresses for use on my web page.  This might take a 
little while, but I'll see that other people can get a connection via me.

Thanks in advance,

Tolouse's Story
A Sonic the Hedgehog story
by Kris Kelley

Part 4.

     Tolouse lay with his head resting on a fallen tree trunk, looking 
at the night sky and the stars that managed to poke through the dense 
growth of the Great Forest.  It had been three weeks since he had 
started his quest to find Knothole and the freedom fighters, and his 
luck had been minimal.  He had grown tired and weak, especially since 
food had not been foremost on his mind lately.  Now, as he stared off 
into space, a sense of futility was beginning to come over him, and he 
felt helpless.  Soon, his mind began to wander, and memories crept up...

     ..."Honey, wake up!"  He felt himself being carried up and out of 
bed.  "Mommy, what's wrong?"
     "No time, baby..."

     ..."Shirley!  Look ahead!"  The whole world went sideways right 
after that.  He had never felt so scared in his life...he started to 
cry...

     ...and then his mind wandered back even more...

     ..."Daddy!"  Tolouse ran to his father's open arms.
     "Careful, Tolouse!" Jean said, laughing.  "You'll wrinkle the 
uniform..."

     Tears began to well in his eyes.  He had not thought of his father 
much during his time in the underground village, but now, the few 
memories that he had were coming to him vividly...

     ..."Okay, just one more button...there.  Tolouse, you look 
splendid!"
     Jean presented his son to a mirror.  Tolouse was dressed in a 
smaller version of the Palace Guard uniform.
     Tolouse beamed with pride, and his father smiled.
     "You'd make a fine Palace Guard, son..."

     ...and then, one final memory...

     ..."Mommy, where's Daddy?"
     "He had to work late tonight, baby.  The King is throwing a big 
party, and your father has to be there."
     "Aww.  Wish I could go to the party."
     Shirley laughed and picked her son up.  "Oh, I just bet you do..."

     Tolouse wiped his eyes, but the tears continued to flow.  Then, his 
eyes found a star up in the night sky, a star that twinkled a little 
more brightly than its neighbors, a star that shined a little more 
stubbornly through the thick network of tree branches.  He focused on 
that star, and slowly, his determination returned.
     "I *will* find Knothole," he told the star.  "You'll see."
     Tolouse then got up, ate some dinner, and found a place where he 
could sleep, safely hidden from anything overhead.  Before sleep came to 
him, his vow had been repeated.
     "I *will* find Knothole."

     The next morning, Tolouse woke up to find the Mobian sun shining 
brightly through the trees.  He got up and was about to try and scrape 
together for breakfast when something moved out of the corner of his 
eye.  He turned to see.  Somebody was walking through the forest, about 
50 feet away from him!  Tolouse got up and moved quietly from tree to 
tree, trying to get a closer look.  He saw a middle aged raccoon, 
walking with a limp.  Tolouse considered calling to him, but the fear of 
the underground village had stayed with him, and he lost nerve.  He 
decided instead to follow the raccoon, hoping against hope that maybe 
the raccoon could help him find Knothole.

* * *

     Bookshire had been walking through the forest for about an hour 
when he realized he was being watched.  Too many leaves had stirred 
without wind, and too many branches had moved to attribute to the usual 
forest animals.  He decided to do some backtracking and throw his 
follower off before returning to Knothole.

* * *

     Tolouse sat on a small boulder, growling with frustration.  He had 
followed the raccoon for what seemed like an eternity, and then the 
animal had just disappeared.  How was he ever going to find Knothole at 
this rate?

* * *

     Bookshire went over to Sonic's hut and tapped on the door.  The 
blue hedgehog and Knothole's resident folk hero answered the door and 
said, "Bookshire!  How was the walk, bud?"
     "Listen Sonic, somebody was following me in the forest."
     "What?  Who?"
     "I don't know but I think I managed to elude whoever it was."
     "I'll check it out.  Be back in a Sonic-second!"  Sonic began 
accelerating in place.
     "Wait a minute, Sonic, don't you think you should---" but Sonic was 
already off.
     Bookshire sighed, completing his statement: "---talk to Sally, 
first?"  He shook his head and chuckled at Sonic's traditional 
impatience, and then made his way to Sally's hut.

* * *

     Sonic made several quick searches of the areas surrounding 
Knothole, and something caught his eye.  "Hmm, we appear to have us 
another fox!"  He homed in on this new fox's location.

* * *

     Tolouse was walking slowly through the forest, thinking about the 
raccoon he saw that morning, when a strange noise sounded behind him.  
He spun around and found himself face to face with a blue hedgehog.  He 
jumped, scared and dumbfounded by the hedgehog's sudden appearance.
     Tolouse tried to speak but couldn't find his voice, so Sonic spoke 
first.  "So, bud, what brings you to this neck of the woods?"
     Tolouse tried to speak again, and managed to stammer, "Who, who are 
you?"
     "Hey, I'll ask the questions, bud!"  But after studying the 
frightened fox, Sonic decided that his name wouldn't hurt anything.  
"The name's Sonic, bud.  You got one?"
     Tolouse's mind raced.  Sonic!  Sonic the Hedgehog!  That was the 
name they kept hearing in the radio transmissions!  He'd found them.  
He'd found the freedom fighters!  Tolouse very nearly collapsed in 
relief, and his heart beat with excitement.
     Sonic stood, tapping his foot impatiently.  "Well?"
     Tolouse finally found his voice, and with it his determination.

     "My name is Tolouse.  And I want to be a Freedom Fighter."

---The End

Tolouse's adventures will continue, in "Run with the Fox."

OK, I've been sitting on these chapters for a while, doing the odd
rewording here and there, but I'm feeling generous, so what the heck....

Herewith: the concluding chapters.  I like to think that the story's
ending will generate a little discussion -- we'll see.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                 Chapter 9



     "She WHAT!?"
     As soon as Sonic and Bunnie had heard the translation, they
headed for Sally's hut.  At first she was still too wrapped up in
her grief to respond; when they burst into her hut she simply
said: "Please, just leave me alone."  But when they told her of
Sandy's disappearance and of the note she had left behind, Sally
was on her feet in a second.
     "This is terrible!  How long ago did she leave?"
     "Ah don't know, Sally, and neither does anyone else.  She's
as quiet as Sonic is quick."
     "That means she's got a head start.  We still might be able
to catch her."
     "Forget it, Sal," Sonic said, "she doesn't want to get
caught."
     But Sally wasn't listening.  Instead she was writing a quick
note, inserting it into one of the mechanical carrier pidgeons
Rotor had designed, and was programming it to fly to Uncle
Chuck's hideout in Robotropolis.
     "You think she means it?" Bunnie asked.
     "Of course she does.  Look at the bottom of the letter.  You
see that smudge where her signature would be?  She made that with
a drop of her own blood.  I don't know much about the Nomads, but
I DO know they're firm believers in blood-vengeance!  She blames
Robotnik for our mother's death and she's going after him.  We've
got to stop her!"
     "Whoa!  Time out!" Sonic yelled.  "Since when are we in the
business of saving Robuttnik's butt?"
     "Believe me, that's not the point!"
     "Then I'm missing something here!"
     "Sonic, I had to watch my mother die and I couldn't do a
thing about it.  I am NOT going to sit around here while my
sister commits suicide!  Now come on!"
     Without another word, Sally raced out the door.  Sonic had
never seen her so worked up before, but he was even more
surprised when Bunnie said, half-aloud and with a broad grin on
her face: "Welcome back, Sally-girl!"
     "Say what?"
     "Tell you later, Sugarhog."


     It took a couple of minutes of waiting for Dulcy's head to
clear after her latest landing.  Once she understood what was
happening, though, she was winging her way back to Robotropolis
with Sonic, Sally and Bunnie on board.  All the while they were
flying, they scanned the open country for any sign of Sandy.  At
one point, Sally ordered Dulcy to land.  Even before Dulcy had
touched down Sally had lept off of Dulcy's back, rolled on the
ground to cushion the landing, sprang to her feet, and ran toward
a small bush.  There was a piece of torn cloth on it, from
Sandy's cloak.  They were heading in the right direction.  No
sooner had the others picked themselves up from Dulcy's landing
than Sally was urging the dragon to get back in the air again.
     In a little while they touched down at a garbage dump
outside of Robotropolis.  This was a common rendezvous point for
the freedom fighters on their various missions.  As soon as they
were on the ground, Sally had Nicole in hand.
     "Nicole!  Display the three most likely routes between the
dump and Robotnik's headquarters!"
     Instantly, a shimmering hologram map of the city floated
before them.
     "OK, Bunnie will take the southern route, Sonic will take
the northern route, and I'll go up the middle.  We'll meet at
Uncle Chuck's; maybe he'll have heard something."
     "What if we find her?" Bunnie asked.
     "Get her to Uncle Chuck's; I don't care how.  Dulcy, you
retrace our path and look for her again; I want to make sure we
didn't pass her on the way here."
     With that, Sally ran off, leaving the other freedom fighters
standing in the garbage dump.
     "You want to tell me what that 'Welcome back' thing was
about?" Sonic asked Bunnie.
     "Oh, that!  Well, Sally ain't been herself lately, what with
her ma dyin' and all.  I was just glad to get the old Sally
back."
     "Me, too!  Good luck, Bunnie; gotta juice!"
     "Good luck Sugarhog!"
     With that, Sonic tore off on his appointed route, Dulcy took
to the air once more, and Bunnie started on her way.
     Bunnie was never keen about coming to Robotropolis, no
matter how important the missions.  The city had changed so much
under Robotnik that it was nothing but a gigantic threat.
     After ten minutes of walking, Bunnie attempted to get her
bearings.  This had been the oldest part of town before Robotnik
blighted everything.  The buildings were low and the structures
square.  Bunnie dimly remembered that the building where she was
sheltering herself had been the old Klein Bottle Works. 
Cautiously she rounded a corner.
     Looking to her right, she froze: the unmistakable shape of a
SWAT-bot lurked in a shadow.  She wondered whether to make a run
for it.  Yet the SWATbot didn't move after several seconds. 
Emboldened, and fervently hoping that it wasn't equipped with a
motion sensor, Bunnie edged toward it.
     Once she got closer, Bunnie could see the hole punched into
its chest.  She could also see another SWATbot lying on the
ground in three pieces.
     "Yep," Bunnie thought to herself, "this is Sandy's calling
card, all right!"
     She looked down the street.  There was something else in the
shadows further along.  Cautiously moving toward it, she saw
another fallen SWATbot.
     "Oo-wee!  This is just like followin' a trail of bread
crumbs!"
     On she went, hiding in shadows and tracing a trail of fallen
SWATbots.  She thought she'd counted seven wrecked bots--and who
knows how many before she picked up Sandy's trail--when she
turned a corner.  There wasn't a SWATbot to be seen, not even the
smallest part.
     "Uh-oh!  Ran out of bread crumbs."
     Suddenly she thought she could hear a hover unit
approaching.  That meant more bots!  She quickly ducked into an
alleyway.  Bunnie was so intent on wondering what to do next, she
didn't notice the metallic hand inching out of the shadows behind
her and getting closer and closer.

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                Chapter 10


     "Bunnie, what are you doing here?"
     Bunnie hadn't had time to think before she felt herself
being grabbed by the scruff of the neck and being pushed up
against a wall.  But she breathed a sigh of relief when she
recognized the harsh whisper as belonging to Sandy.
     "Ah'm here because Sally's tryin' to keep your hide in one
piece!"
     "My hide isn't any of her business.  Or yours!"
     But there was no time to argue the point, because they both
heard the ominous warble of a siren.  That meant SWATbots were on
the way.  They started down the alley but only got halfway when
they saw the end of the alley blocked off by three SWATbots. 
Turning around, they saw three more closing in from where they
had entered.  The two quickly ducked into what appeared to be a
deserted loading dock.
     "You got any ideas?" Bunnie asked.
     "We're going to have to take them on hand-to-hand."
     "And just how the hoo-ha are we supposed to do that?"
     "SWATbots only have an advantage because of those arm-
mounted blasters of theirs.  They aren't built or programmed for
close-quarter fighting.  They only have enough armour to shield
them from blaster fire.  Once you're in close, you have the
advantage because you've got their strength and they don't have
your intelligence.  Can you kick with those legs?"
     "Uh-huh.  Why?"
     "Aim for the hip.  The seam should pop like a bubble."
     "Yeah, right," Bunnie thought to herself.  "Now the only
problem is gettin' close enough to those SWATbots to spit in
their eye!"
     With mechanical tread, the two ranks of SWATbots closed in
on the darkened loading dock.  "SURRENDER, FREEDOM FIGHTERS!" one
of them droned, "BY ORDER OF ROBOTNIK."
     Closer and closer they drew.  They stopped short of the dock
and began scanning the area.
     It was empty.
     They moved into the shadow of the dock for a closer look. 
They continued to visually sweep the loading dock area, as they
were not programmed to look up at the ceiling area first, in case
a couple of freedom fighters were hanging just out of sight from
a ledge.
     "Now!"
     Bunnie and Sandy dropped down on the two closest bots.  On
the way down, Sandy grabbed a bot by the neck, and the head came
away as cleanly as a grape from a stem.  Tossing the head aside,
she then punched the next nearest bot in the chest, and it
crumbled in a shower of sparks.  As soon as Bunnie hit the
ground, she managed to get off a spin-kick that struck a bot
where its hip would have been.  Bunnie had never practiced this
maneuver and although she landed on her tail she was still in one
piece.  Which was more than could be said for the SWATbot.
     "Great move, Bunnie!  But work on your landings."
     But Bunnie didn't have time to think about that because she
found herself looking up at a SWATbot training its blaster right
between her eyes.  Before the SWATbot could get off a shot,
Sandy dropped to the ground and rolled directly underneath it. 
Looking up between its legs, she jammed her fist through the
bot's crotch and into its pelvis, then seemed to fish around for
something.  With a quick yank, she pulled out a thick support rod
and some wiring which she tossed aside.  The SWATbot shuddered
for an instant, then collapsed in a heap.  "Ah don't blame him!"
Bunnie thought.  That left two bots standing.
     "Duck behind one!" Sandy called out.  "They won't target
each other!"
     Bunnie did so, and while the bot swung around to re-
establish the target on Bunnie, she used her own robotic arm to
punch a hole in the bot.  It was incredibly easy...and it was
also a rush!
     Then she saw the last standing SWATbot drawing a bead on
Sandy.  Emboldened by her victories, she ran to the bot and
grabbed it by the arm.  The instant she did so, Sandy grabbed the
other arm.
     "Make a wish!"
     The two arms of the bot came away cleanly.  Its head spun
and it sputtered sparks for a second before going offline.
     "All right!" Bunnie shouted.  Sandy, however, was in no mood
to high-five her partner, for she saw that the alley had been
blockaded again by another half-dozen SWAT-bots.  The two ducked
back into the shadows to wait for them.  A minute later they were
still waiting.  The SWATbots weren't advancing.
     "Why do Ah have a bad feelin' 'bout this?"
     Bunnie didn't have to wait long, for almost instantly, the
door to the loading dock swung open and the two were drawn into
the darkness of the building by an irresistable force.  They
hurtled through the darkness, finally coming to rest with a bone-
jarring thud against a huge metallic surface: a plate magnet.  It
held them fast by their roboticized parts.
     "Ladies, so nice of you to drop in."
     Bunnie and Sandy looked up.  In an observation room near the
ceiling of the chamber stood Robotnik.  He leaned into a
microphone.
     "Snively, restrain the prisoners.  And wait until the magnet
has powered down."
     The lights came up in the room--little more than a storeroom
with pipes and conduits running along the ceiling--and Snively
walked over to a nearby control panel.  Pulling down on a large
lever, Sandy and Bunnie could hear the hum of the electromagnet
begin to diminish.  Even before it loosed their grip on them,
Snively was approaching them with a blaster in one hand and two
sets of shackles in the other.  They were bound with their hands
behind their backs and frisked for weapons.  Snively took two
knives from Sandy: her curved Nomad blade and a second, longer,
straight-edged knife.
     "My, my," Robotnik said as he entered the room, "didn't your
mother ever teach you that little girls shouldn't play with sharp
objects?  By the way, how is your mother?"
     "If I wasn't wearing these restraints," Sandy spat back,
"I'd arrange a face-to-face meeting!"
     "I see; my sympathies," he said with absolutely no trace of
sincerity.
     "You'll be in need of sympathy yourself one of these days:
that robotic arm of yours is killing you."
     "Oh, no.  We get along quite nicely."
     "It's the truth!  It's slowly poisoning you!"
     "And you want to put me out of my impending misery.  How
thoughtful.  No, I have other plans.  Snively, prepare the
roboticizer."
     "At once, Sir."  
     Just as Snively was leaving the room, Sally and Bunnie heard
the tramp of SWATbots.  The six that had been cordoning off the
alley had followed them down the tunnel, and the door to the room
had shut behind them.
     "As you so ably demonstrated just now, my SWAT-bots are
somewhat lacking in your fighting expertise.  But you, Princess
Sandy, will make an excellent commander of my forces, once you
have been totally roboticized so as to answer to my bidding.  I
can use someone who knows the fighting skills of the Nomads.  And
just think of the irony: the army that finally destroys the
Knothole freedom fighters will be led by Princess Sally's own
sister!
     "And as for you," he said as he turned his attention to
Bunnie, "you won't be roboticized just yet--not until you've told
me everything I want to know about Knothole."
     "In your dreams, Robotnik!"
     "Do you know what I dream of, my dear?  Ways of extracting
information from reluctant forest folk such as yourself.  You
WILL tell me what I want to know.  And I can assure you that the
method I will use to learn what I want to know from you will be
slower and more painful than necessary."

                                BLOODLINES

                        A Sonic the Hedgehog Story

                            by Daniel J. Drazen



                                Chapter 11

     "You need to work on your party manners, Robuttnik!"
     Robotnik turned around.  Standing just behind the rank of
SWATbots at his back, as if he'd materialized out of thin air,
stood Sonic.
     "Sugarhog!"
     "Business before pleasure, I'm afraid: GET THAT HEDGEHOG!!!"
     In an instant, the Chase was on.  Sonic never really
admitted it to anyone but this was not only what he was best at,
but what he lived for.  Running for running's sake was a rush,
but to pour it on as fast as he could while staying one
split-second ahead of Robotnik's SWATbots--he never tired of it. 
     Of course, he never took risks without a reason...at least,
that's what he told Sally whenever she'd scold him for his
reckless conduct.  Even now his dashing about the chamber had a
purpose.  It kept Robotnik and his SWATbots from focusing their
attention on a service duct near the ceiling.  It was the duct by
which he had entered the room.  And it was from this duct that a
long strip of black cloth now hung down.  It was Sally's bakhat,
and Sally was rappelling down it to the floor of the room.  In a
second, she was undoing the restraints on Sandy and Bunnie.
     "How'd you find us, Sally-girl?"
     "Uncle Chuck picked up a dispatch call for SWATbot
reinforcements.  Now come on," she urged, "we've got to get out
of here!"
     But once Sandy was freed from the restraint, she shoved
Sally to the side, drew a third knife that had been concealed in
her boot, and ran straight for Robotnik.
     But one of the SWATbots had detected her sudden movement. 
It only took the bot a second to lock onto Sandy and fire.  The
blast hit her in her right arm.  Crying out in pain, she fell to
the floor.
     "SANDY!!"
     Sally and Bunnie dashed to Sandy's side while Sonic got
right in the SWATbot's face.
     "Hey, that's no way to treat a lady!"
     The taunt worked; the SWATbot's attention was back on Sonic
and away from Sandy, who was being helped up to a kneeling
position.
     "My arm!" she gasped.  "Can't move it.  Blast must have
shorted it out."
     "Can you stand?" Sally asked.
     "Don't think so.  Feels like it weighs a ton!"
     "That's it, Sandy-girl.  You are out of the game!"
     And with that, Bunnie used her own robotic arm to toss Sandy
over her shoulder like a sack.  With the helpless Sandy in tow,
Bunnie and Sally headed for the bakhat and began climbing, while
Sonic continued to use a combination of speed and taunts to keep
Robotnik and his SWATbots occupied.  So consuming was Robotnik's
hatred for Sonic that he had no idea that his other prisoners
were escaping.  Finally, Sonic came to ground at the far end of
the room, away from the magnet.
     "Man, you're slowin' down, Robobreath!  Want me to be your
personal trainer?"
     "Hedgehog, you've been a nuisance for far too long.  It
isn't worth it for me to roboticize you."
     "Never would've figured you for the compassionate type."
     "So I've decided that I'm just going to have to kill you."
     "Whoa, right the first time!"
     The half dozen SWATbots all drew a bead on Sonic as Robotnic
stepped behind them.  "Any last requests, rodent?"
     For about two seconds, Sonic seemed nonplussed.  That was
all the time he needed to sum up the situation.  From where he
stood, he could see that Bunnie and Sandy were now safely inside
the conduit.  He could also see Sally just inside the duct,
holding onto the bakhat as if ready to give it a pull.  Sonic
followed it down to where Sally had apparently tied it off, and
the old hedgehog smirk was back in place.
     "Yeah, I got a request: smile for the camera!"
     With that, Sally gave a pull on the bakhat...which she had
tied to the power switch of the electromagnet.  It started to hum
to life.
     "NOO!!!"
     It only took a second for the magnet to warm up and begin
pulling Robotnik toward it.  In that one second Sonic had gone
into a Sonic spin, skittered up the wall and across the ceiling,
entered the duct, and was exchanging a high-five with Sally just
as Robotnik slammed into the magnet.  Followed by a half-dozen
SWATbots.
     "Snively!!  Cut off the power!!  Get me out of here!!!"
     But by the time Robotnik had been freed, Sonic and the
others had safely disappeared down the miles of ducts and
conduits of Robotropolis.

                              to be concluded

     "OK, try it again."
     A silent tension filled the air inside Sally's hut.  Sandy
was seated at a table, her right arm the subject of intense work.
Rotor had studied it for some time and was trying to get it
functioning again.  After half a dozen adjustment it continued to
lay there, unresponsive to Sandy's attempts at movement.  Now
Rotor had tried totally replacing what appeared to be a shorted-
out motivator located on the forearm.  Sally and Sonic held their
breath.
     For a second, nothing happened.  Then, in a single smooth
motion, Sandy's fingers curled up into a fist and just as
effortlessly uncurled.
     "Yes!" Sonic yelled.
     "Great job, Rotor!"
     "Thanks, Sally, but looks like the upper arm motivator is
going to need replacement as well.  I think I have one in the
storeroom."
     "Not the storeroom!" Sonic wailed.
     "Sonic," Sally said, "go help Rotor look for one."
     "But Sal, if he opens that door I'll be up to my hips in
chips!"
     "Sonic," Sally said deliberately, "go help Rotor!"
     "OK, OK," Sonic said as he followed Rotor out the door. 
     Sally closed it behind them, then turned to face her sister.
"What did you think you were doing?"  she demanded.
     "You know what I was doing, and you can't stop me from
trying again!"
     "Well, I can try!"
     "Can you honestly say that you wouldn't do the same thing if
you were in my position?"
     "Can you...."  Sally stopped.  For a second her attention
was no longer on Sandy.  It was as if she had seen something
before her eyes, something that had disappeared as soon as it had
come into her field of vision.  She turned back to Sandy.  Her
voice was subdued.
     "I...I just remembered of Mother's last words to you.  How
she called you by name and said: 'You are free now to choose your
own path.'  Then she held your hand and said goodbye.
     "Sandy, it was wrong of me to try to stop you.  I'm sorry. 
I won't try it again if you're bent on vengeance against
Robotnik.  But you have to understand that our fight against him
has never been about revenge.  It's been about restoring our
families, our world.  It...I'm sorry, Sandy; I hope you
understand."  With that, she turned away.
     "Sally?"
     Sally turned.  For the first time, Sally saw tears in
Sandy's eyes; Sandy had not even cried at the death of their
mother.
     "I just remembered Mother's last words to you," Sandy said. 
"How she called you by name and said: 'You have understanding,
and you have friends.'  Then she held your hand and said goodbye.
     "Sally, I...I'm sorry I didn't recognize that understanding
sooner.  I owe you a debt I can never repay."
     "What do you mean?"
     "When the possibility arose that you might still be alive, I
didn't want to believe it.  I tried to talk Mother out of
travelling to Knothole to see you.  Even as we made our way here
I secretly hoped it all would have been a lie.  But if we'd never
looked for you, then Mother would have gone to her grave
somewhere in the deserts of Nomad country with a question in her
heart, and the sands would have buried her stone of memory inside
of two days.  Instead, she died with her heart at peace,
surrounded by the love and loyalty that a Queen deserves."
     Sally smiled at the same time tears rolled down her cheeks.
     "You have done more for her than anyone could have hoped
for, Sally.  I am your servant."
     "No," she said gently, "you're my sister."  Sally put her
arms around Sandy, who did the best she could with the one arm
that functioned.  A minute later, Sonic and Rotor re-entered the
hut.
     "Got it, Sally!  It's just take a minute to install."
     "Yeah," Sonic griped, "and I'll be picking computer chips
out of my quills for a week!"
     "So," Rotor went on, making idle conversation, "you gonna
stay around here, Sandy?"
     Sally held her breath.
     "No, Rotor.  I've been thinking about it and I've made up my
mind.  I'll be travelling to the East.  I was thinking of hooking
up with Dirk and the Eastern freedom fighters.  I think I can
teach them something about fighting SWATbots."
     Sally breathed a sigh of relief.  "That's wonderful, isn't
it, Sonic?"
     "Yeah, but...."
     "But what?"
     "Why'd she have to tell Robuttnik about his arm?  Why should
we do him any favors?"
     "Who knows, Sonic?  Maybe he'll return the favor some day."
     "I don't get it, Sal."
     "So what else is new?"
     "Hey!"
     "Look, Sonic, if Robotnik knows that he's being poisoned by
his own robotic arm, sooner or later he'll reach the same
conclusion that Uncle Chuck did: that the only effective
treatment involves deroboticizing it."
     "So?"
     "So maybe he'll begin working on a deroboticizer of his own,
and when he's got it perfected...."
     "Then we use it against him by undoing all the people he's
roboticized!  Hey, I guess that's way past cool after all!"
     "What can I say?  Being way past cool runs in the family."


     "Are you gonna be all right, Sandy?"
     Sandy and Bunnie stood at the eastern edge of the Great
Forest.  It was sundown, and the sky to the east was darkening to
a smooth indigo while streaks of fire still lit the western sky. 
Sandy had taken leave of Knothole, but Bunnie had insisted on
escorting Sandy to the edge of the woods.
     "I'll be fine, Bunnie.  I learned how to navigate using the
stars from the Nomads."
     "That's nice," Bunnie said as she leaned against a tree with
her arms crossed before her, "but that's not what Ah meant."
     "I know," Sandy said quietly as she looked at her
roboticized right arm, fully functional once more.  "Don't worry
about me, Bunnie; I won't try anything stupid against Robotnik...
or myself."
     "Ah'm glad to hear it," Bunnie said as she took Sandy's
hands in her own.  After several seconds she hadn't let go.
     "Is there any chance of your coming East some time?" Sandy
asked.
     "No; mostly Ah'll be right here in Knothole."  Several more
seconds passed, and still Bunnie hadn't let go.
     "Bunnie...there's something...something I've wanted to...but
I don't...."
     "Then Ah will."
     Bunnie then embraced Sandy and kissed her.  She kissed her
hard, on the mouth.  Sandy was caught off-guard, but only for a
second.  She then returned both the kiss and the embrace.  They
seemed to go on forever.  When their lips parted with a quiet,
moist sound, three stars were already visible in the sky
overhead.
     "You take care of yourself now, Sandy, y'hear?"
     And for the first time, Bunnie saw Sandy smile--a smile that
a second later was hidden behind a Nomad's veil.  Sandy took her
bearings from the sky and started out silently toward the
darkening East.  Bunnie sighed, turned and began walking through
the Great Forest to the West, back toward Knothole.

                                  THE END

I just finished reading over the final chapters of "Bloodlines"
today, and at first when I saw the notice in Chapter 12 about
the ending being "offensive", I started thinking.  Do they cuss
or do something else that's really evil?  No.  Sally and Sandy
just had a very personal talk where they got to know each other
better.  Nothing out of what you would expect from the Sonic
Saturday cartoons.  They stayed in character, which was not what
I initially expected from the notice.

Personal note to Daniel:  Hey, don't worry about the format.  IMHO,
it's nothing worse than what I wrote in the "The Temporal Syndrome",
which means:  it ain't bad at all.  Keep your style of writing;  I like it.

When I read any story based on something I've seen in TV or Movies I often 
try to visualize it as a 'new episode' or 'new movie'.  Sometimes the story
works this way while sometimes it doesn't... this one definitly WORKS.

Its probably a bit too intense in parts for Saturday mornings and the 
scene which you said might offend probably wouldn't make it (however you
do see it sometimes on Bugs Bunny Cartoons).  I was definitly more 'suprised'
than offended with it.  (and definitly more tasteful than a certain JPG I
won't mention)

Excellent Story Dan!  It was worth the wait.

Is anyone keeping all these stories somewhere?  I know 'Rotor's home page
has a bunch of them.  I haven't been able to keep everything in my user
account and had hoped to transfer them from an FTP site somewhere when I
get some disk space.

Hey Dan, you can't send the story up to an FTP site can you???  I missed 
the first half, and I don't want to read the last part till I read the 
first part.  (I'm sure there's others who've missed it too.)

To all those who have commented on Bloodlines:

Thanks for your support.  A few things to get off the top of my desk:

[Note: if you haven't read the story yet, we're talking major spoilers
coming up here]

     In all honesty, I had no idea that Bunnie and Sandy's relationship
     would take the turn it did when I started writing.  I had no
     intention of outing Bunnie or anyone else.  But at one point when I
     was struggling with the final scene, in which Sonic and Sally were
     to be featured as well, the image of Bunnie and Sandy kissing
     popped into my head and wouldn't let go.  *I* was shocked at first,
     but then in looking back at the story I could sort of determine how
     other incidents (the initial meeting in Ch. 1, the dialogue in Ch.
     6, the combat against the SWATbots in Ch. 10) could have been said
     to be leading up to that moment.  Obviously I wrote this before
     reading "The Power of Love," and before Netscape was installed on
     my machine so I could discover how large a part Bunnie plays in the
     Mature [or should that be "IMmature"?] Fan Art section of Rotor's
     homepage.  I was sort of afraid that some of her drooling fanboys
     would take umbrage.

     Hope nobody got too bummed by my allowing Queen Alicia to die.  I
     suppose that I was inspired by the death of Julayla in Sonic #18
     ("In The Still Of The Night").  It certainly gave me a chance to
     (re)construct Mobian burial customs.  While I was writing this, I
     was rehearsing Faure's "Requiem" for a performance (I was in the
     chorus) so I guess the subject was on my mind.  I also viewed the
     burial of Queen Alicia in Chapter 8 almost as the flip side of the
     "Circle of Life" sequence from _The Lion King_.  I even went so far
     as to try to come up with an appropriate stanza to be sprinkled
     throughout the passage, passing it off as a "half-remembered cradle
     song" that was part of the Mobian collective consciousness.  It's
     just as well; I don't know that I could have pulled it off without
     being too heavyhanded.  Besides, I was only able to write the back
     half of the stanza:

	  And when the dust has received us
	  And the sons of our daughters are gone
	  In the hearts and the minds/Of those left behind
	  The love and the memories live on
	  In the circle of life....

    I'm beginning to think that, as Shawn seems to be specializing in
    introducing bits and pieces of "Treknology" into the Sonic corpus, I
    seem to prefer delving into the social history of Mobius: its
    history and customs.  One short story I'm working on touches briefly
    on what can only be called a religious cult, and another longer
    story that's started to come together (and which will represent the
    final battle for the fate of Mobius) is shot through with mythology
    -- but first I need to research the Chaos Emeralds, their origin and
    properties.  Based on Brad's description of their role in the
    original Sonic comic miniseries, there's some good potential
    material there.

    I also began the story back in December/January, so I wasn't up on
    the impending Sally miniseries with its "evil twin" plot twist.  It
    wasn't much of a surprise -- dummy covers for issue #3 in just about
    any ad showed her doing battle with herself, so the only question
    was: what was the source of the evil twin?  It's a subject close to
    my heart in that I'm a twin myself.  In the case of Sandy, I hoped
    to create a character that would seen to be related to Sally yet
    distinct.  Not "evil" by any means but definitely different.  And
    one of the comments I still hear whenever I have visited my brother
    for the odd holiday is how much we sound alike!  So Bunnie's
    mistaking Sandy for Sally on the basis of voice is plausible as far
    as I'm concerned.

Thanks for putting up with my ramblings.  I believe that the entire
story will show up on Rotor's home page at some point.  If you missed a
chapter or two, let me know and I can email it out to you -- I haven't
got around to deleting it from my hard drive yet.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Wow! 

I thought this was a great story!  Every interresting plot twist and character 
development was interresting as well as entertaining.  I saved all the 
chapters a while ago to read at some later date...when I recieved the ending 
chapters today,
I decided I should probably start reading. :)  But I didn't expect to read 
the whole
thing in one sitting!  I just couldn't stop - very compelling!  

Story spoilers ahead:









I really liked the notion of a twin sister & dividing the royal 
family...that whole sequence of events provides a great explanation for the 
show (as well as Sonic being an orphan)  
All of that sequence also worked well within the story & within the thoughts 
and feelings of the individual characters.   I thought that was the story's 
best achievement...A good balance between the stoyline and emotional 
reaction of the characters.   

I liked the ending...(I thought it was a little predictable, but good just 
the same)

Comments on the VERY ending...
After reading your WARNING message, I  was wondering what strange or perverse
ramblings I would encounter, but when I read about Bunnie + Sandy...well...I
laughed.  Not because I was dissapointed, but because it doesn't make much sense
to me in this story.  The way the story was written, every emotion, action, 
and event
was clearly explained  or foreshadowed in some way...but this little event 
came clear
out of the blue with no explanation or warning!  I'm not sure it's an 
appropriate ending
to this story...I mean, it seems to me this should have been at most a 
sub-plot within the story or another story all together.  (Id Est, This was 
the last thing I expected to be reading in a story focusing on Sally, her 
mysterious sister, and her
long-lost mother)  But then again, I didn't write it! ;)

P.S. Great job, Dan!

Bra*vo*, good sir!  This is the best Sonic fanfic I've read in... well... 
ever!  It far outshines the great majority of fanfic I've read on this
list recently (I haven't any names handy, but recent works on this list
have looked more like technical journals than adventure stories), and even
exceeds, IMHO, my *own* writing abilities (a difficult task, considering
how un-H my O is.  (:3)

Care to send me a copy of the whole thing, or point me to an FTP site?  I 
want this one for my archives...

Don't forget that everything posted to the mailing list is archived.  You 
can get a very large file from the mailing list software, or get last 
month's messages from ftp.mv.com at /pub/users/rat/sonic/list-archive.  This 
month's messages will be on the ftp site in a few days.

No matter how you retrieve the archives, you can browse them with pine or 
elm if you're on a Unix system.

I'd like to take this time to publicly respond to some questions sent to 
me through private E-mail (You know who you are).




[Major spoilers if you haven't read it]







First, it surprises me that some of you are surprised that Packbell has 
the capability to kill people.  In all the stories that I've put him in, 
I have tried to depict him an evil individual who cares nothing for those 
around him.  I hinted a little as to his homicidal nature in "Tails' 
Tale" during the Blueebrook invasion.  He was walking through the village 
taking pot shots at whatever moved and didn't care what he hit.  Taht 
means that if he killed someone, he didn't care.  One of the goals I have 
for "The Experiment" is to expand on these ideas and show you all what a 
truely twisted and evil character Packbell is. He cares nothing for 
anyone's life other than his own and he takes pleasure in causing suffering.

Second, a person remarked to me that, in the scene after Sonic and Bunnie 
are captured, Packbell remarks that he will kill Bunnie if he hears 
Sonic's sonic boom.  The person stated that once Packbell hears the boom, 
Sonic and Bunnie would be long gone.
Packbell's hearing is far more advanced than a human's plus his reflexes 
are a hundred times quicker.  As soon as his mind registered the 
beginning of a boom, which would only take about half a second, his 
fingers would react instantly and crush Bunnie's neck.  I will admit the 
the rescue possibility existed, but it wasn't a sure thing.  Sonic knew 
that and that's why he surrendered as easily as he did.

a.t.a (and thus would not have known).  If you're interested in seeing 
the final product, once posted to a.t.a., please mail me direct.

Helloooooooo, All!

I am beginning work on a parody called "Sonic and Dot". It will be the
instruction file for a non-existant game called "Sonic and Dot". Why Dot?
Where are Yakko and Wakko? Just wait..... ooooh, the suspense!!!!

*HINT*: This game was invented in an alternate universe. Which means that
Robotnik was never created by Sega, and Warner Brothers never invented
Animaniacs- Sega used the characters. AND, in this universe, Tails is the
enemy. Tails hires Dot to keep Sonic, Yakko, and Wakko off his tail (bad
pun warning)... oh, I've said too much.

'K, bye.

I'm testing a new mail program.  Unfortunately, you can't set distribution
to "local" for a mailing list.  I'll be making as few tests as possible on
the list.

No way!  Tails is too cute, and innocent, and sweet, and... and...

(reflects on fact that people who play nice guys on TV shows, like Brent 
Spiner (Data) and the guy who did Balky on "Perfect Strangers", generally 
do great bad guys.  And on "Another Day, Another Dungeon", with the 
sweet-as-antifreeze elven assassin.  And on his own personal invention, 
Evil Kender Mages.)

Hmm.  Maybe this has possibilities after all...  (:3

Mr. Drazen,

I've finally got around to reading the last four chapters of "Bloodlines" and
I have to say it is one of the finest stories I've read  in a long time. I
especially enjoyed the final scene with Bunnie and Sandy. I had a feeling
something like that was going to happen, but I must confess that it wasn't
quite what I expected. Personally I think it makes the Freedom Fighters seem
 just a little less innocent. I hope to see more of your work on the net in
the future.

Keep up the good work,

S. Dello Russo
