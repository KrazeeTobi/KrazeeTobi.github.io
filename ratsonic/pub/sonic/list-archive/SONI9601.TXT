Someone keeps uploading these captured images from the Sat AM TV show, and
they still haven't written me about it! They just keep putting them in
/incoming on rat.org

So whoever you are, please speak up!

>Can the game be played on a 386, or does it have to be Pentium?

Hmm.. Well as I don't have a pentium, I have this odd feeling it will be
running on 386 code. Basically I am putting in multiple routines for
gameplay, so my 486dx40 can handle it with fair GFX. A 386 (might) cope, but
it depends.. I know for one thing. A 386DX40 with Local Bus VGA.. outnumbers
my measly 16bit VGA card... and should do fine for the game. [Of course I'm
not cutting FX there.. I have a DX4-100 in the next room with a VLBVGA, so I
will be coding for that too.. meaning from machine to machine you'll get
different GFX levels.  Except for CRAY-XMP's that is.. It looks like I just
can't work out how to real time ray-trace everything.]

>BTW. I have to ask... Will Tails be in it?

in FT terms.

:smiles, "and more TOO!"

Cheers

=3D=3D=3D=3D-

Everyone, LISTEN UP! :)

We need a list of people working on this project.  It's going to be big, and
we'll need losta beta's (game testers), artists, etc.  Here's what I'm
working with, (as I am <trying to be> the co-ordinater of this):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----
Lead Programer =B7=B7=B7=B7 Ablater (Simon Howes)
Sound d00d =B7=B7=B7=B7 Michael's Brother (can't remember his name..Aaron=
 Rheyes, I
beleive?)
Background artist<S?> =B7=B7=B7=B7 Douglas LoConti (that's me)
Plot designer =B7=B7=B7=B7 (above, can't read)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----

I mean, this is ALL i have right now!  :)  We need more info, (there's
probably more people working on this, Simon knows the rest of them,) I was
on with Simon for about 15 minutes today, (long distance sucks, especially
international,) this is all under hat right now, but I understand the=
 following:

This game is going to be one of if not THE sweetest game for the PC ever
created.
Sega can't touch us, since this is FANDOM, and we're not making a buck off
of it.  In other words, it's legal to make this game.
The music score is going to be AWESOME, (and I can personally garentee this,
because:) I know the sound boy, and the way we're importing this to PC is a
method NOT used b4, but will be an excellent method at that. =20

If you are on this project and NOT LISTED ABOVE, write me at: mighty@en.com
giving me your FULL REAL NAME, what you're doing, and your telephone number,
(no, not so I can prank you, so I can call and get some info,) and of course
everything is confidintial.  Myself and Simon will be the only ones that get
your number.  Well, anyways, it's important.  It's kind of hard to make a
game when you don't know who's on the team, ya know?  Well, as far as I can
tell, this is what we still need:

* MORE plot designers (those that take this job MUST WORK TOGETHER!)
* LEAD PROGRAMMERS (to help Simon; he can't do ALL the work!) :)  =20
* SOUND TESTERS, COMPOSERS, PORTERS, (that is, you have to be able to
convert sound)
* ARTISTS!  For the charachter poses!  Make them small, (one square inch?)
send them to
            Simon or myself
* And, of course, LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of beta testers!!! (write me, if
you want to be
           one; I think >10< will suffice.)

IF you choose to write me, please give me all the info I requested, and
you'll be "officially" added to the team.  Like I said, Simon is working on
his sound system-once that's up and running, this thing will be underway.
REMEMBER!  This is important.  If you decide to join/help our "team", you
will have your name in the credits!  :)  And who knows where it leads from
there.... >>hopefully<< $ega will buy our little "idea", and we'll all get
rich. <g> Well, write me if you can help.

sorry for the long message,

Very nice piece!  I've always favored "mood" stories to ones with
non-stop action.  Keep up the good work.

Since USA's programming is no longer being screwed up by the

we now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

I know what you mean.  My very first post to rec.arts.animation dealt
with this topic.  I gave it the subject line "Schizo The Hedgehog" and
it concerned the difference in mood between the syndicated cartoon
series (wherein Robotnik is largely a buffoon) and the weekend animated
series that ran on ABC (wherein Robotnik has more of a Darth Vaderesque
air about him).

This schizophrenia continues even in the comics.  While some writers
(such as Kanterovich and Penders in the Sally Miniseries) can take the
"fight" in Freedom Fighters seriously, other writers like DeCesare and
Gallagher have to keep the jokes coming.  I've traded posts on this
subject with Paul Castiglia at Archie Comics (who used to work in
editing the comics before moving on to other Archie work and leaving
Sonic in the editorial hands of Scott Fulop).  Paul left the impression
that the comics have to pass review from representatives of SEGA who
insist that the material be kept "light."  But there's a difference
between banter with a humorous edge, and going into some mindless
joke-telling mode.  Many of the Gallagher/Manak stories fit the latter
description.

Personally, I'm convinced that the Sonic team at Archie believes that
their primary readership consists of 8-12 year old boys.  As a result,
they are not about to explore some of the harder realities of the
conflict.  "That's The Spirit" in Sonic #20 came as close as they ever
have: still, the way the story was told and supported by Manak's artwork
undercut the poignancy of the plot [the freedom fighters believe that
Sonic is dead].  The Tails 2-part story "Growing Pains" in #28 and #29
was an even greater example of what could go wrong: quite aside from the
flaws in the story *per se*, it was hard to take Tails' heartbreak
seriously when he was stuck with such melodramatic prose.

Until such a time when SEGA authorizes an illustrated novel featuring
Sonic, I don't expect the situation to change at Archie any time soon.
In the meantime, those of us who aren't hesitant to deal with such
things can always post fanfic.

And I'm not just saying this because of your kind words about
"Bloodlines," either!

This isn't going to be a recap of CS#3; I'll let John Johnston's review
stand for submission to the FAQ File.  Instead, there are a couple of
loose ends I want to address.

"Southern Crossover" represents a vast improvement over "Growing Pains"
which started out strong in Part 1 and went into a nosedive in Part 2.
Still, Gallagher has demonstrated he has something to learn about story
structure.

Of the two major trouble spots, the more minor of the two has to do with
the subplot of Tails as The Chosen One (as prelude to the upcoming
series "A Sense of History").  Tails certainly meets one of the major
requirements of a mythological hero: he is the runt of the litter, the
small one, the youth.  He has set out to prove himself to his elders and
discovers that he is in for more than he bargained for.  By the same
token, Athair as shaman takes the role of the Helper in Tails' adventure
(I'll admit it: when I got hold of SC#3 I also got out my copy of Joseph
Campbell's "Hero With A Thousand Faces").

All this would be well and good, except that there was no foreshadowing
of Tails' adventure until he was let off in the crater.  Tails (and the
reader) then get a crash course in Mobian cosmology -- or at least the
highlights thereof -- before an abrupt turn back to the plot.  Tails
neither mentions nor reflects upon what has happened to him once outside
the crater.  Perhaps this is all prelude to Tails' larger adventure
still to come, but it's also clumsy storytelling -- rather like a
3-course meal consisting of soup, salad, and a roast turkey swallowed
whole.

Yet the more grievous error is to be found on SC#3, page 21.  Tails
finally admits that he misses the group from Knothole, that he had been
resentful of them, and that he now realizes that they really did care
about him.

The problem with this declaration is that there is no evidence to back
it up.  Aside from dropping Sonic's name a couple of times, you would
think that Tails hadn't bestowed a moment's thought upon any of them.
He was eloquent enough in resenting their "infantile treatment" of him
(SC#1, p. 5), but does he miss them?  Is he shown remembering better
times with any of them?  Does he ever wish they were with him when he
was being subjected to attacks by Octobot or the Wing Dingoes?  No.  His
primary concern is himself--in the pages of "Tails To Astonish."  Yet
we're asked to believe that he got over his resentment of Sonic et al.
somewhere along the way.  It is not the job of the writer to ask us to
believe that something has happened -- it is to SHOW it happening, as
plausibly as possible.  This Gallagher failed to do.

One of the limitations of comics is their limited ability to show a
character's "inner life" -- their thoughts, aspirations, emotions.
Everything has to be out front as quickly as possible because deadlines
are approaching and space is limited.  In this respect, Japanese _manga_
have the advantage.  With stories in Japanese comics running to hundreds
of pages (and sometimes being serialized for years if they are
successful), there is space for a character to be introspective, to have
an emotional life.  It is this -- and not just the novelty of being a
two-tailed fox -- that has spawned a following for Tails.  His fans
sense a character with a personality, with feelings.  But the Tails of
"Growing Pains" and (to a lesser extent) "Southern Crossover" gets
seriously shortchanged in this regard.  He becomes a character reading
lines.  And when the reader is simply told "He feels this-and-that"
without being made to understand WHY, the reader is shortchanged as
well.

My $.02.

Hi Dan (Drazen)! I finaly got to hear from you!
Thanks for giving such a nice reply to my questions on Mobius Idiots :') .

I have a question. In Bloodlines, did Bunny kiss Sandy because she was a
le___an, or because they were like a same person, going through the same
childhood pains, and getting ripped in two was a very devastating thing (kind
of like a good-bye to myself kiss)?
I am hoping that the last one was it, and that whoever read it and thought it
was the first one, would think again.

By the way, I've noticed something in your whatchamucallit:

I understand what you mean, and I must say that I've noticed a degree of
inconsistency in the writing styles, myself. I really think they could do
more to ensure that the storylines and the character development are more
consistent on an issue to issue basis. Sometimes I put down an issue and I
think, "Jeez, that was cool!" Other times, I feel like I'm Mr. Rogers.
"Hello boys and girls. Can you say 'plot?' Sure you can!"

If it is true that Sega has a large say in what the comics turn out to be
like, then I say they're shooting themselves in the foot by harming the
characters in this way. THEY NEED MORE DISTINCT PERSONALITIES WITH MORE
EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION. It's that simple. I don't suppose anybody was a fan of
the Ninja Turtles series which was put out by Archie? In it's final 2 years,
I truly enjoyed what they were doing with it. They explored the characters'
emotions and the writers were creating very intricate plotlines, with
complex themes. They just kept setting up more interesting events making you
drool in anticipation of the next issue. Sonic just seems to be turning into
a Joke-a-Thon more and more with each passing issue. The emotional and
character development just isn't there, and when an attempt is made, it
usually falls flat on it's face because it just doesn't fit in.

This fact may be due to Sega's influence, as well. I believe that 8-12 year
olds are Sega's main target audience for...(guess what?) the Sonic the
Hedgehog games.

Such a thing would truly be cool. Since it is doubtful that this is going to
happen, however, I hope that all of you budding authors out there continue
to share your talents with us. Keep the fan fic coming! I can't get enough
of it. We can only hope that Sega doesn't poke their nose into this area
like they did the pics. Until that happens, I'm going to be optimistic.
Let's also hope that something happens to wake Sega and Archie up. 
Good goals for 1996, wouldn't you say? :)

Geez! I just keep writing and writing, don't I.

Since I wasn't here for the last year, I dont know if you guys figured out
the reason for ABC's cancelation of DiC's Sonic episodes. Anyway (I think I
used this word 24 times allready. Anyone got a replacement?) I have an
interesting theory that I worked out, and at the same time disproved, and
then proved.

Since this list opened up way before the cancelation of the episodes,
somebody migh have found it and noticed that the main Audience for the show
would be us, and not 8-12 year olds. Besides, 8-12 year olds might have
trouble understanding the circuimstances of the story. We, on the other hand,
do. ABC was probably getting low ratings on the show, since the kids, weren't
that much into it, and we were either in an inconvenient time to watch it, or
were worrying for our reputation too much to watch it in public. Then why
didn't ABC move the show to a more convenient time for us? Maybe they didn't
have enough money. 

This is my theory, and I ran out of things to write.

	Remember Nomad? I was on for a few months a while ago before my friend 
de-subscribed. I have counted the moments and finally I'm back. I want to know 
something......what is going on here? I left for a few months and come back to 
new ?faces? and about fifty new things. 
	Oh, did anyone get my parting message? Think way back....oh well. 
	I have some news, I am working on a Sonic story and hope to give it to 
Bookshire after it goes through another fifty revitions. (I am a 
perfectionist...and the story just seems to get better and better)

	It's nice to be back again...

		I never did get the awnsers to the questions I asked in a letter 
before my temperary removal from here. So here they are:
	How old are you people? (no offence intended) [I'm 17]
	And no one gave me a straight awnser to this next question:

	Would anyone like to see a PENCIL AND PAPER RPG game for Sonic? The 
computer game that just popped up in the works while I was gone is great, but 
what about a one of these?

I believe the answer is your second responce - both girls are going through
the same problems - being partially roboticized and will eventually be 
sudduced by the "Roboticization Syndrome", the illness where your flesh 
becomes contaminated by your mechanical parts.

That is a very good theory. 

BTW. Dan, if you're reading this, maybe you can add this one.

I think it may be possible, but I have to disagree with you here. Up until
very recently, the Internet was perceived as some kind of limbo where
computer junkies and sexual perverts hung out. It hasn't been until very
recently that people have realized that the Internet can also be a great
doorway to new markets and world-wide access to increased revenues. I'm not
sure Dic or Sega could've cared less about what the few of us thought. Their
loss.

exists could you tell me where I could get a copy.

Dear Mighty:

I have just returned from my vacation to find your lengthy response to my
simple request.  Unfortunately you have decided to go full force into an area
without being on the inside.  If you were on the inside, you'd know that the
owners really ARE very stirct when it comes to time spent on the phone.  I
can't change facts and I don't make the rules and beyond that, I can't spend
a lot of time with a lengthy response.  That's just the way it is.  In fact,
you will find that is the case with most businesses out in the world.  Ask
your parents-- I'm sure they'll tell you that bosses limit phone time.  I'm
sorry if you are upset, but perhaps one day you will be in a similar
situation and understand.  Once you're on the inside, you realize that the
concept of "big mean companies" who "don't care" about the fans and are
involved in all these "conspiracies" really is an exxageration.  I know-- I
was on the outside once and now I'm in.

Regardless of this episode, I hope you continue to get enjoyment out of our
comics and I wish you a prosperous new year...

Best regards,

Paul Castiglia

I think I would too.  I've heard so much about the homosexuality issues 
that I no longer want to hear anything about them, pro, con, or 
otherwise.  Enough already!

Let's not have this on the Sonic list.  We all know it would degenerate 
into a flamewar that will accomplish nothing but waste of bandwidth.

It's alight, I'm over it now.  It just seems that smaller companies have
more "leniance" <sp?> on certain things...it doesn't really bother me, but
it could be something that makes Archie stronger.  Well, no hard feelings,
and Happy New Year anyways!  :)

Doug (I forgot you were Mighty!):

It probably would make Archie stronger-- and if we had more manpower, perhaps
there would be someone available to fill this need.  But until then-- no hard
feelings on this end, either!

Best,

Yes, we do... that's why I'm so commited to making this thing work....which
I hope it does, for I'd be upset if it fell through.  We've taken a lot of
crap from Sega about a new game, (I have inside sources,) and they keep on
raising the platform.  It seems, once again, Sega's primary interest is the
money, and the games and their quality comes second.  I am more interested
in giving people what they want at any cost, (hence, my $40.00 call to
Africa yesterday).  It is important to me and to many other people that this
game is a success, and I plan to go to the far ends of the Earth, (litteraly
<sp>) if the need be. =20

Cool.  Hey, BTW, how do I get back issues again?  For some reason, (I'm

Tarl, we are in the works of a platform game like no other.  It will
(hopefully) run smoothly on a 486DX, (it WILL run on a 386, but it may be a
bit "choppy", :)) and wonderfully on higher systems, (ie the Penium).  As
stated before, it will be written in Pascal.  The plot is still unknown, but
it IS known that there will be all the freedom fighters from the Saturday
morning show in this game.  We probably won't be able to include outside
chatacthers, (ones you guys made up,) although there may be a few secrets,
(play as Uncle Chuck?  Hm...) The sound system, (from what I gather,) will
be like none other.  Well, write me personally if you have any other=
 questions.

Doug:

At this point, if you know the issue # of the comic you're missing, you may
want to keep an eye out for it in the comics themselves.  From time to time
we run ads where you can order back issues.  It should turn up in there
within the next few months.

I see all these posts about a sonic game which people on this list
seem to be working on but has anyone here heard of a Sonic game (maybe
a port of an existing sonic game) being brought to the PC Game market?

I remember seeing an ad at 'Best Buy' (A chain of discount home 
electronics stores) for getting a Sonic PC game (when the game is 
released) with the purchase of a specific computer system.

Anyone else see this?  Anyone have any more info on this (i.e. will
it be a port of an existing Sonic game or a new game entirely).

It's not DiC I am worried about.

By the way, What's their address? (E-mail) I want to make some compliments on
their art, and some complaints on their allowing of the cancelation. of the

I have seen something like this on Gamer's Review, in Canada. The short
commercial had Sonic fighting a boss from S&K videogame (the prison egg that
kills itself), but heaven't heard of that since. SEGA seems to deny that too.

I don't mean gay! Geez! What's wrong with you?! What I mean is, the way
Robotnik likes to have Snively around to yell at, but never hurts, or
robotisizes him. And the way Snively grumbles at Robotbik, but, even though
he has a very good chance to kill him in every episode (that involved
Robotnik), he just sucks up to him. 
I just thought of an example: In Spyhog, Robotnik is very angry when he finds
out that he has a spy. But when he sees Snively playing around with his
chair, he doesn't even lift a muscle at him (Just tells him to shut up, and
stuffs a mask on his mouth).
I hope this will clear things up.

I could have sworn I heard someone say that the StH game will be made in

Assembly! How come you guy are using Pascall?

	After traveling many an electric mile, I finally reach the mailing list 
after countless screw ups. I don't know how many recieved my messages at the 
other adress or here but I'll summerize what I have said.
	I am Nomad, I don't know if anyone remembers me, but I was here before.
	I want to know if anyone wants a Pencil and Paper RPG. Some have replied 
and I am thankful. I ask because I created one a while back and it was pretty 
good. (no offence to those being made or already made) If anyone has one made, I 
would like to have a look.
	I have a story in the works which I told Bookshire about (I don't know 
if you remember) and I hope it will be finished soon.

But the life long question.. Pascal will be used for memory
allocation/control routines, while assembly for the DigtalPlayer/paralax FX
and sprite routines.

I know.. I just wrote about 300lines of asm..=20

I'm just testing to see if anything that I post is actually making to the

As far as I know of, DiC does not have a e-mail address.  You will find 
their regular mailing address in the faq-dd.txt file.

I wouldn't mind, but it better not be as complicated as D&D which, as
someone put it, "requires nonstop mathematical finagling that would
constipate Einstein."

Dmitry:

First off, welcome to the list (if nobody has officially done so).

As to your theory, you're pretty much on the money.  Sonic's ratings
during the second season weren't good enough because it had the
misfortune of being up against Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox in
the same time slot.  At the time, MMPR was at the height of its
popularity.  ABC tried moving Sonic 1/2 hour earlier after the November
sweeps, but Fox countered by shifting its schedule so that by the time
of the February sweeps, Sonic was opposite MMPR again!  And I guess in
Saturday morning kidvid, it's two atrikes and you're out.

I honestly believe that both ABC and Archie Comics are clueless as to
the degree of crossover for Sonic.  They must think that the
game-players are the core audience and leave it at that, not realizing
the level of sophistication of some of the fans.  Oh, well....

I hadn't planned it one way or another.  As I've explained before: when
it came time to write the last scene of "Bloodlines" I tried writing it
with Sally, Sandy, Bunnie and Sonic but it just didn't work.  Then I
tried thinking about it with just Bunnie and Sandy.  The mental image
came to me of Bunnie planting one on Sandy; nobody was more shocked than
I was!  But I saw no reason to leave it out.

BTW, you're the first one to advance the notion of shared affliction
leading to affection.  I've since been reminded of a quotation from C.
S. Lewis on other literary incidents of alleged homosexuality: "Hrothgar
embracing Beowulf, Boswell embracing Johnson...and all those hairy old
toughs from Tacitus begging for one last kiss before the regiment is
broken up.  All pansies?  If you believe that, you can believe
anything!"

Well, not exactly. I did hear Sega was going to make a PC version of the 
Sonic CD. It wont be too long before it is released. Check the Sega Web

Not to steal David's business or anything :^), and at the risk of being 
masochistic, but I have both seasons (except for the lame Robecca/Odd Couple
episode) on two EP-speed VHS tapes, commercials are included.  I'm willing 
to copy them for $10 postpaid (Canada/foreign will need more for shipping).
If interested, e-mail me for my address (I don't think I'll just give it 
out her in case Sega/DIC is listening :^))

I should be able to get the tapes mailed two Saturdays after receiving the 
money, unless I get two dozen requests at once (and if I _do_ get that 
many, I may have to do what I did with my Muppet tapes: copy my originals 
to another set and duplicate _them_ to save my originals from wear and tear).

years old.

    I WOULD like to have a pencil and paper RPG, but I am already caught up
in one somewhere else. 

     About this Sonic computer game...... is EVERYONE SURE that you can do
it?
  You need someone who knows the C+ and C++ languages in order to do this
stuff.

	First, I'm 17, 18 in 3 months. 
	Second, I thought sure, a few people will want my RPG, but I wasn't 
expecting this many. (I will still give it to you here in a day or two, 
additions and stuff, you know)
	Third, I am warning you, this RPG is mostly untested and those that 
played it liked it. (except for a rabbit who thought he could get a power ring 
and almost drowned because he couldn't swim!)
	Fourth, this game is simple, alot more than AD&D.
	And Fifth, I need to know from the runner of this E-mail thing if I can 
just send parts using this address, or if I have to do it individualy?
	
	So, as always, waiting for a reply,
				Nomad

	PS: How many of you are out there? (in case more messages for the RPG 
request come in)

Hey guys.
	I was just checking my page for some things, and the page didn't 
register on Lynx. I went to check everybody's home page here at the Rio 
Grande Free-Net, and their's were down too. (For a moment there, I 
thought I was pulled. Thank God this isn't the case. <Wiping Sweat Off My 
Brow>) I did contact my webmaster of this problem, and we'll see what 
happens.
	I do appoligize for any inconvienience any of you may be having. 
Hopefully, it will be back up soon. I will notify you when it is so.

I just now checked again, and the web page came back. Everything appears 
to be intact, so I guess I lucked out. Sorry for any inconvienience. To

80 SUBSCRIBERS?! How come I saw only about ten of then? No wait, I can answer
that. They are either too busy, can't call at the time, or just don't care. I
for one like having a small amount of people on the board. Feels kind of like
our own, tiny, Fredom Fighter group, but than, that's who we are :') .

Well... Youre where I see myself in about twenty years. (That was a

P.S. I fixed your menu for you, if you can use it.

I called up this game's home page, and got kind of dissapointed. The first
thing that I saw, was (Cool, "saw" spelled backwards!) a sort of a blue-print
for a sonic video game level. That blue-print looked like a typical, SEGA
made Sonic level. I thought you guys were going to use DiC/Archie style for
this game. I mean adding a forrest (Great f.) a dark, poluted, Robotropolis,
and that kind of stuff, not just some obstacle course :'( .

My friend, who is begging me to make up some excuse to let his dad use AOL
for E-mail (That's right, he wants to join), thought up of an idea to use
some small missions, and make the plot desighned by the player (loose this
level, Robotnik captures somebody. Then either replay the level, or keep
playing). I have also thought up of an idea, that you guys might use some 3D
scenes, kind of like special level StH 2, but with way better graphics. My
friend also sujested that tha player migh use some flying vehicle at least
once in a game (in my upcoming story, Sonic knocks off the torso of a
Flight-bot, and then uses the hover section to make his getaway <no more
spoilers>).

Hope that picture was a dud, and my ideas help.

;)  Dood, that wasn't a picture... that was a scan from something TOTALLY
different....the ONLY thing on there right now is specs of what the game
will have.  That picture means nothing, (although I'm HOPING to get screen
shots up within the next few days..)  Don't be dissapointed...there's
nothing there (as of now..) you'll see....just keep checking it and watch
for changes!

Actually, Mighty, I thought that in any form of publishing, be it printed
matter or video, things were shot large, and then resized to be about 1/3 to
1/2 as large as the originals. Aside from being much easier to work with,
when you resize it, any errors or imperfections are almost impossible to
see. Just curious. I haven't had much programming experience beyond some
elementary level Pascal, so I could be wrong.

Yes, you're both right and wrong.  It all depends how detailed the final
product is. :)  If it's a detailed game, such small blemished MAY actually
show making for a crappy characther.  But, then again, once scanned in, such
things are EASILY eddited.=20

To those whom it may concern:

        The game Twisted Mettle is a far cry from straying away from the
Sonic theme of this list.  We are doing something that few if ANY one has
ever done: kids, teens, and adults alike, are working on programming an
actual game-without seeing one another!  Think about it, do you think that
Sega's crew are miles apart?  This IS monumental, and I think any news about
it or upon it, (as long as we don't have TOO many objections,) are valid for
this list.  After all, we're still dealing with fandom, (I'd hope!
Otherwise, we've got some nerds out there that just love to program!) :) so,
I think such talk is valid.  Any oppinions on this?  And if you object, be
nice...let's not start a flame war... :) Later!

Actually, that's not too far from my own findings on other lists.  I
once recorded the postings for one month from another list to which I
subscribe.  Of the total number of subscribers (about 200), only a
minority (maybe 70) bothered to post anything during the month.  And of
that 70, a mere 7 were responsible for roughly HALF of the data traffic
that month (one of the seven was the SysOp, so that might have had
something to do with it).  A perfect example of what Nixon called "the
slient majority."  Some people just want to lurk.

>...I think such talk is valid.  Any opinions on this?

Well, IMO, this has been one of the more interesting topics on the list for
a while.  Since there's some sort of new rule on the list regarding the
u/ling of fanfic to the list, and there were no binaries on it to begin
with, and nothing else seems to have come up regarding Sega vs. Ratman,
this is really the only interesting thing to read.

( Of course, the fact that I'm going to help to write the storyline for the
game doesn't bias me *much*...  =) )

However, I'm sure someone else here isn't interested in the game for some
odd reason.  I can repect that, too.  So, maybe if I threw out another 
topic, we could start a new thread.  Let me think of one...ah, how about
this:

It is never made clear exactly what the population of Mobius is in either
the comic(s) or the SatAM show, or the demographic breakdown of its various
species are (how many foxes, walruses, etc.).  Mobius is a pretty big
place, so I figured there'd be at least 250 million sentinents on it
(being that most Mobians are smaller, and take up less actual space than we
humans do).  What's everyone else's opinion on it? 

Joe.

This might be off subject, but help is help.

I heard someone say that they are having trouble finding Animaniacs comic.
The comic store where I by my Archie StH, orders them, and now has about five
current issues for about $1.50 each. I would be able to ship them out, in
case it is nesesary (For around $1.50, of course :') ).

I agree whole-heartedly, Mighty. Since you stated yourself that the game
will be completely different from the traditional "obstacle-course"-like
game which sega has produced in the past and more like the Sonic universe
that is reflected in the fan-fic and in the series, I don't see why it
should be invalid. Ratman has not complained. (As of yet. There's been quite
a lot of talk going around for a while now, so it doesn't look like he's
going to in the near future.) So, can we assume that we have his "thumbs-up"
on this one? I really can't wait to see what you guys come up with..... :)

I'VE FINALLY FINISHED THE HUNT BEGINS!!!!!!!!!!!!  <Dances a jig> I'd have
to say it's my best Sonic story yet.  Of course, it IS set in that Headache
Universe you know from Jaded Views and Blue Flames, but there's a lot less
Headache this time.  8)  The first half is pretty much like a normal Sonic
story even, and the last half is a tad reminiscent of those David Prower
stories...anywayz, I'll send it in as soon as I manage to divide it up into
small enough chunks to send through the list (probably 4 of 'em, maybe
more, maybe less).

A lot of us don't have all the details right now, (myself for one..) but we
are getting together and putting things together.  Although it WILL be an
action game, it WILL NOT (hopefully, we're steering this way,) be an
"obsticle course"... I am hoping to get the say so to have some "secret"
characthers added, (i.e., the ones YOU people create,) but I don't know how
it will go over.  I'm putting up some new immages tonight, and they should
clear things up a bit...

I have another game suggestion:

Ever since I saw and played my first Sonic game, I wished that someone would
make a game where Sonic doesn't have a speed limit. Maybe in this game, when
Sonic uses a power ring, the speed limit could be the power limit of the
computer. You could use something like press and hold forward to accelerate,
let go to slow down, and press back to hit the breaks. I know that that might
sound more like a car racing game, but then, I would really like to see Sonic
break the speed (and videogame :') ) barrier on a home computer screen!

Frequent Posters Rule! 
	The concept that people like us keep Sonic popular, reminds me of the Tiny
Toons episode where Babs "renews" an old toon by making her have a lot of
fans. I think that if it weren't for us and all other groups of Sonic fans,
Sonic the Hedgehog wouldve "died" about three years ago. (A sick and sad
thought).

By the way, You people who just listen, but don't write, SUCK! Come on! We
need help with our game! We need Sonic info! We need REAL Sonic fans!

Why don't we make a list for this project. That way, everybody will know what
everybody else is doing at the moment. Plus, the game will turn out a LOT
more organized (Let's hope we don't hit the saving Robuttnik sceme:'). I have
seen these kind of things happen). In fact, why don't we just use this list?
That way, the money will be saved, the info will be sent, and the viewers
will see the update on the game!

okokok...(-I- don't suck by the way) But how about giving Dulcey a part 
in the game...maybe something to do with flying, or maybe a level where 
Dulcey has to fly a non-flying character somewhere.  Just a thought.

Hmm, let's paraphrase that.  'If it weren't popular, it's popularity would've

Don't throw that word around too loosely.  Except for my stories and
one comment about them, this is the first I have posted to this list in ages.
And I would take offense to you telling me that I 'SUCK' if I thought that
you meant it personally.

"REAL Sonic fans"?  What is this, the army?  Sheesh. :)

Dmitry, your theory's possible; it was probably a combination of factors.
One of the deciding factors was that DiC put out at least one animation cel
from the show without Sega's permission.  As for us being ashamed to watch
it in public, I'd have to agree; I have told nobody but my family, closest
friends, and, naturally, fellow Sonic fans, what exactly it is that I get
up at 6:50 on Sundays to tape, referring to it as only, "You know...that
one...with the thing..."

I haven't done too much in Pascal, but I could help a LITTLE in that area.
Also, with my new scanner, I could do graphics (considering I figure out
how to get it to resize the graphics to a square inch instead of 5 square
screens <G>)...plot?  Hmmm, that's a toughie, we hafta depart from the old
"Robotnik tries to roboticize all the Mobians and the Freedom Fighters stop
him" storyline...perhaps the FF find a special artifact that could
potentially allow them to win the war if they play their cards right?  Hmmm...

Oh, and for whoever was talking about how many sentients probably exist on
Mobius?  Again, that's a toughie.  First, you have to decide whether you
can consider the robots "sentient"; for, as Uncle Chuck said, they can
still think and feel what's happening around them, but can't make any
decisions.  I'd say there are maybe a few thousand sentients who escaped
roboticization, max.

Yup.  I agree with you completely, as usual.  What gives me some hope in
the direction of the Sonic comics is that the Archie version of TMNT
started out as a cornball representation of a really lame (although I
didn't think so at the time) cartoon, then, over the years, managed to
expand and have some really superb storylines, which proves that Archie can
make a gag-filled comic into something really deep.  Here's hoping!

Suggestion NOTED!  I always get sad, too, when our blue buddy can't out run
some of Robo's banicks.  One problem with this is, (I don't know if you've
seen it,) in some very face-paced games, the screen cannot keep up with the
fast moving charachter(s).

As far as I can see in the cartoon, Snively always grumbles things like 
"That big round guy" and the such. They have quite a tense relationship.

I think that there's still one more thing we have to clear up:
Is the game Twisted-Mettle for Windows, or for DOS (Please say DOS. Windows
would lock up, crash, screw up, and do all those
other things windows were desighned to do :') ).

Also, why Mettle?

Hmmm... I've only programmed AMOS and other BASIC dialects, but is a 
flying character harder? They don't have to think so much about gravity 
and where they can move or not. Shouldn't it in fact be easier?

Why would he do that, with his popular games? Of course he has got to 
have fans, or noone would buy the games, but if he hadn't got them, he'd 
never have gotten even a second game, would he?

AFAIK, I  am a real Sonic fan, but much of the stuff discussed here is 
either about fanfics which I haven't read (The one I've read, with some 
berzerk called Davy Crocket put me off, I don't like it when people mess 
with the universe I like, introducing characters who don't blend in.), or 
I don't have the time to follow up or I haven't got anything to add.

Well, First of all, Mobius isn't that big. (I still didn't get an answer
for: Which of the StH episodes has Robotnik looking at a MAP of Mobius). I
think that 250 million people is(was) a good estimation though. Although I
like to believe that there are very few people left. In my world, Robotnik
started taking over the farthest cities from Mobotropolis. This way, the King
would have a less chance to find out what's happening. (The Great War?) Then,
after taking over a closer city or location, Robotnik would destroy the old
city, and all of it's inhabitants, thus avoiding the hastle of looking over
the prisioners. When Robotnik finaly got to Mobotropolis, the King didn't
suspect anything because there were no reports (all the inhabitants who could
tell about it were dead with their cities). Thus, Robotnik managed to get
everybody by surprise, and once again, to avoid the hastle of prisioners and
satisfy his hunger for violence, killed/roboticised the inhabitants. 

This idea was based on:
Metal-Fox
Bloodlines
Capture the Flag
("Its funny the way authors can write about something without knowing it." -
Some quote I heard somewhere. Maybe I made it up. I forgot...)


Also on demographic breakdown of species, I would think that the walruses
would be a minority in Mobotropolis, and foxes, squirells, and other rodents
would be the majority of the population on Mobotropolis (Greaf
forest/swamp/plain nearby).
In fact, I don't even know what Rotor was doing, living there (Not that I
don't like him. He has a pretty important part in my story, which is comming
up very slow for some reason, *looking at watch* Sh%t ! It's 1:00 am! Not
enough time to write it today!).

Hope that helps (and continues the discussion).

BTW - (what does BTW stand for?) There are 80 subscribers, about 10 everyday
posters. About 500 to 1000 people on Mobius, about 50 to 100 are freedom
fighter. Any similarities? :')

Haha, a fast paced Sonic game in Windows? Windows isn't double-buffered, 
so that's probably impossible.

That was *one* of the many things I hint on in BAM, as well as the

Another thing I tackled in BAM, where Bunnie and Chuck got their roboticized
parts upgraded to a model that is more environmently friendly and is
indistinguishable from actual flesh, (Unless you shift it back to 'bot mode
if you need to).  Bunnie was relatively unharmed because her flesh parts were
adapting to the poison.  But poor Sir Charles got stricked with cancer and
had a heart attack promptly after the treatment...he later recovered due to
the recouperative <sp?> ability to his new body....

This is a perfect example of what NOT to post to the list. This is 
something that should have gone to just the author. Understand?
And do not reply to this to the list about this or I will really start to 
get annoyed.

I think that that might be the one when Robotnik leaves to control some freedom

It will probably annoy a lot of people if you takeover a list for your own
purpose, just because it's vaguely on-topic. Don't do it.

It's certainly not tiny; it's at least as big as Earth, in my estimation.

Well...I'll have to disagree with you slightly there.  Remember that
Robotnik has lots of factories/mining operations/et al all over Mobius,
and that all of those are manned at least partially by roboticized
citizens.  Robotnik's not a stupid man, after all: killing everyone would
leave nobody to do the drudgery...or witness his triumph.

Assuming 25%+ were killed, and 70-75% roboticized, that would leave the

That was my belief as well.  Of course, according to the general fanfic

Subject: Sally and Sonic

I was reading the synopses of past issues of the Sonic comic book (in 
this list's FAQ), and I came across one synopsis (for Sonic #18) that 
mentioned Robotnick learning of Sonic and Sally's "impending" wedding.  
Was this wedding part of the fantasy induced by Robotnick in Sleepy 
Hollow, or was the wedding for real?  Are they married now?

Please let me know, as these issues came out before I subscribed to the 
comic.

Lately, there have been too many inappropriate posts to the Sonic list.

Please read this message carefully.  You will be responisble for knowing 
and following its content.

The Sonic PC Game ================= I have tried to be a little more
lenient on these posts as it is a fan project and not a Sega product
(Sega's games are already represented in 2 Usenet groups.) These posts
have begun to dominate the list and to overstep the list's purpose.  As
stated in the Sonic list's new member introductory text, the list is for
discussion of the Sonic characters, cartoons, comics, and fan stories. 
Many of these posts can scarcely (if at all) qualify as discussion of
Sonic characters, and are not at all discussions of the cartoons and
comics. 

There appears to be enough interest in this project that a seperate list 
should be considered.  I, personally, support this idea.  A seperate list 
will help the main list return to its stated purpose as well as free 
non-interested subscribers from having to receive these posts.  The only 
"inconvenience" to users I see is having to remember 2 posting addresses 
rather than 1.

The leader(s) of this project might want to ask Ratman (nicely!) if he is 
willing to set up a second list, or seek a LISTSERV site that will host 
the list without a fee.  Pobox.com will set up a mailing list for 
interested persons for a fee, as will many local Internet Serivces 
Providers.  As a last resort, it is possible, albeit inconvenient, to run 
a mailing list from a personal e-mail account.

Whether or not there is a second list, I am willing to go along with:
 a) Occasional posts to this list that recruit new persons to the
    development team and/or summarize the current state of progress
    in development of the game.  Also, the final announcement of
    completion as well.
 b) Adding referrals to the team leader(s) to the new subscriber
    introductory text for this list.
 c) Adding referrals to the team leader(s) to this list's Web
    page (which really needs to be updated anyway).

Until and if a second list is formed, please begin taking these 
inappropriate posts to private e-mail.


Sonic's Paper Game
==================
Many of the issues concerning the PC game above apply to this game as 
well.   I have no problem with the announcement that this game was being 
offered to interested persons.  Posts discussing the game play overstep 
this list's purpose.  The "I want a copy" posts should definitely have 
been sent directly to the person making the announcement and not to the 
entire mailing list.


Respect For Other Users
=======================
Contributions are what keep this list alive, but are not required of 
anyone.  Who really wants to read posts that say "I have nothing to say 
but I have to say something, so here's my message."?  You have the right 
to be active or lurking according to your own interest and personal time 
availability.  Do not hurl insults at someone or a group of persons 
because they aren't active enough to satisfy you -- or for any other 
reason, for that matter.  If you have a problem with a subscriber on the 
Sonic list, send e-mail to that person and/or sonic@rat.org (with a copy 
of the offending post).

What next?
==========
Advisements and administrative warnings have already gone out to some 
persons.  I hope this message will eliminate the need for me to send any 
more such messages.  Anyone who now posts or continues to post 
inappropriate messages is subject to being deleted from the subscriber 
database.

Be aware that the Sonic list could also become a moderated list.  I would 
not want to see this happen because it would cause posts to be delayed up 
to 48 hours (not to mention the effort it would take me to forward 
*every* message to the list).  Please think before you post, and don't 
make this become a moderated list.

Adulations or flames regarding this message or any other administrative 
issue should be sent to sonic@rat.org and not posted to the list.

Thank you for your attention and expected co-operation.

I would rather not believe there are "very few" left.  If they started 
with a population of 250,000,000, a 99% loss would take them down to 
2,500,000.  A 99.99% loss would be down to 25,000.  If the only Mobians 
left are those we've seen in the cartoons and comics plus those in fan 
stories, we may as well say Robotnik has succeeded.

Either 250 million is too high, or there must be other survivors 
underground and on the Floating Island who we've not seen yet.

I like the overall line of reasoning, but what about residents of an 
undestroyed village who go visit a destroyed village (not knowing what 
had happened)?  Surely word would get back to the King, and I don't think 
he's foolish enough to not investigate such reports.  Or do we assume 
that inter-village travel is something they just didn't to very much of?

If Mobius went from 250,000,000 to <=1000 (that over -99.9995%), I think 
I'd be about ready to cry for them.:-(  And nothing could possibly be 
adequate punishment for 'buttnik and Snively wiping out >249.9 million 
innocent Mobians.

BTW, "BTW" means "by the way".

it seems to work pretty good.

Yea, I've seen that happen (It's the only way to travel in Sonic 2 :') ).
Once again, my friend came up with a solution: 
When Sonic grabs(takes out a power ring), mace the backgrounds blurred, and
thus simple. Also put blinking warning arrows on the edge of the screen to
warn of an incoming platform (so you will have time to react, and jump onto
it). Well, maybe you can skip the arrows, but I think that the blur is a good
idea.

you meant it personally.

I actually wrote that to get attention of people who didn't participate. I
think it worked pretty well, as you can see. I saw at least three new people
that I haven't heard of before.

Uhh.. don't insult the constituants... first rule of making allies. :P
Besides... most of us who are LISTENING, DOOD, aren't exactly bubbling over
with lots of ideas or information--we're here to LISTEN for stuff we haven't
seen, heard or thought up.  If everyone was exciteable and wanted to be on
stage, there wouldn't be an audience.  So apreciate the ones who DO lurk...
it's ALWAYS nice to have participation, but I do think insulting was pushing
it a bit.

As it turns out, the "wedding" of Sonic & Sally was actually part of a
summer stock production.  Didn't mean to spoil it for ya!

     I'm sorry everyone, but I gotta' quit this Sonic mailing list stuff. It
takes WAY too long to run it through my flash sessions, and I need to spend
as little time on AOL as I possibly can!

     So if anyone wants my drawings or would like to just say hello, then
you'll just have to E-MAIL me.
PLEASE DON'T RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IN THE SONIC MAILING LIST BECAUSE I

We interrupt this topic (Sorry) for a shameless plug about the up and coming
Sonic game.

The game requires mass system resources, and I'm going to be squezing clock
ticks out of your little processor till you can cook pizzas (very small
ones) between the CPU fan and CPU. Using skip-frame technology, and multi
detail levels, even a Pentium-133 with double barrel carburettor, overhead
cam, 12 speed-electic gearbox and watercooling won't be getting 1000 frames
a second,=20
just detail that'll blow your mind. While the good old "betsy" machine will
be getting reasonable quality, but not "jerkiness."=20

>What's a mettle?

Mettle is what a characters soul is made out of, IE.. "Where is you mettle
now great warrior?" and then, "I never lost it fool, and for daring to say
what you have I.." <REALITY BREAK> well, you get the idea. Twisted Mettle
it's a pun, cause there's plenty of twisted rusted metal in Roboland, and
there's also plenty of twisted mettle in you, if you've seen everyone you
love robotocized or killed. Get the idea? :) Let's just see whether it's
metal or mettle that's twisted when the game ends.=20

Someone asked about the obstacle course thing, and I agree.. hell I want
realism, we've all seen Mario and played it about half a zillion times till
we get these mega finger muscles and crush people's throats etc.. but that's
not really on topic.. the point is.. I don't like obstacle courses.. and
besides those swingy gizmos are hard to code. Now with the flying
characters, well I'l see what I can stick in and what not.. remember there's
not enough coffie in Africa to put *everything* in, course that's what
sequels are for... well I'll see what I can do... I'll give it my best shot.=
=20

Hell I want something gripping, something where when the final boss toasts
you, you scream you feel pain, then violently bash you monitor in, not
seeing or feeling the blood seeping over your hands, then you begin kicking
the refridgerator door, till you get your hands on some coffie.. then you
hijack a weather station to get their CRAY-XMP, to get more FPS.. and they
end up calling up the SWAT-Team in who shoot you off while you're drinking
your coffie... but hell ... as you bleed to death you say.. "It sure was=
 fun."

Cheers

Um.. can you guys mail questions to me or mighty instead... the list guys
are my friends, and it's not really fair clogging their list up with junk
about Swat-teams, CRAY-XMP's and computer-car-talk.=20

I think that all of this was real, but the marriage didn't do through, due to
Robotnik. So, I gues the answer is:
No, they are not maried.

I don't see how 2 lists would be a great inconvenience.  But that's a 
moot point because the Sonic list is run not by the mob but by the list 
owners.  Not one cent of your tuition or connect time fees pays for the 
costs of operating the list, rat.org, and all the machines in between.  
If you might want to pay some of these costs and maybe get some "say", 
send mail directly to rat@rat.org.  Membership in *any* mailing list is 
not a right or entitlement, and subscription to any mailing list does not 
grant you authority to set its policy.

If you have anyting to say with regard to a possible second list, send 
mail directly to sonic@rat.org or rat@rat.org.  Do not post this to the 
Sonic list.

I have already published over the list that most posts related to the PC 
game are inappropriate for the list.  If this is not observed, we can 
convert the Sonic list to fully moderated status and only approved 
messages will be seen by anyone.

Replies to this message or messages on other administrative issues should 
be sent to sonic@rat.org and not to the entire list.

No, how's this for deciding. Anyone even MEANTIONING the PC game on this list
will be removed for a week. Understand?

This is effective on Monday since it might take awhile for it to get to
everyone. If you want to talk about this, write me or sonic@rat.org

If you feel the need to talk about the PC game, I can setup a mailing list
just to talk about the PC game. It's not fair to have people subscribe to a
list because they think it will be about the Sonic characters, and end up it
having being overrun with posts about a PC game. I'm not going to let this
happen. No way.

We've already had one person unsubscribe because of so many posts being about
this. We're here to talk about Sonic and the freedom fighters, remember?

Hi Symon! Glad to hear from a new (address?)

That's what I thought. Glad that Perv directory is gone.

Ooh, another Quayle-ism.  "It wasn't what it was."  Got any more? :)
And by the way, don't you think a little more polite way to try and get
people to post would be simply to ASK?  No matter what you wanted it
to sound like, saying people 'SUCK' was pretty darn rude.

Now, on another note, I'm seeing all sorts of posts about this video game,
and that role playing game, that, frankly, I have not the foggiest idea
about and, again frankly, don't really want to.  The Sonic universe, in
its 4 different forms, was quite confusing enough before we stepped in
and spiced up the soup even more with God-knows-how-many new characters,
theories, explanations and, <<shudder>> shall we say, 'imaginative' drawings.
So, I'm starting my own thread, one that I, who at this point am only
keeping up with the comic book and occasionally writing some fan-fic that
focuses on the true-blue Sonic characters, not our several thousand
extentions.

The subject:  What do you all think of the artists for the comic book lately?
My rundown:

Spaziante:  Definitely one of the best.  It's kind of a shame they don't
 use him for this publication more often, but given the way he creates the
 characters.. it might be easy to see why.  Don't want any parental
 complaints, hehe. :)

Mawhinney:  Very nice style: 'toon, but not childish.  Very consistent, too.
 He makes the characters look the same no matter what the angle or position.

Manak:  Boy, Mawhinney and Spaziante are the best for this comic!

Penders:  Not too bad, but I think he kinda ruined Geoffrey St. John.

Gallagher:  His art matches his writing style:  exagerated in that 'toon-
 super-hero kind of way, with plenty of puns thrown in for effect.
 However, I don't think it works too well in the Sonic universe.

some of the stores I saw on the page, I was hooked on them.  I just decided

characters being mixed in with the stories, but look at bookshire. In most

WARNING, MIGHT BE SOME SPOILERS

      About a week ago, I bought my first issue of Archie's Sonic the 
Hedgehog comic. The art is done by Ken Penders, so if you know this authors,
you know what to expect. In this issue, Jeofry St. John comes back and helps
Sally and Sonic defeat a new robot. The topic I want to discuss is Jeofry St.
John (or as my friend calls him "That skunk dude"). Was he so popular in
Sally's solo stories? He doesn't seem so much of a good character to me? And
who is he, anyway? 
      At the end of the comic, there's a message to the reader, asking for a
vote on who should Sally go out with, Sonic, or Jeofry. I deffinetly think
Sonic. I wrote (but forgot if I sent :') ) them a letter saying that "Why
doesn't Sally see who really loves her? All jeofry does is lipwrestle, and
flatter her with his words. Sonic, on the other hand, risks his life for
Sally everyday, and tries to do everything possible to keep her safe. My
friend (from now on Mike   P.S. I might be sending some of his messages later
on, but only as a last resort) thinks that "That skunk dude" should just go
and ever 
be used in these stories again. Any other opinions or explanations on this
character?
      There is a knuckles solo story included in this comic. Since I missed
the earlier comics, could someone fill me in on what's going on?
      The third story in this comic is a Rotor solo story (You heard me
right). Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes! First of all, rotor goes to see his
family near the north pole. Acording to our fanfic, Knotholians had their
parents killed, roboticized, or sent through a hole in the wall. Rotor finds
(and was expecting to find) his whole family, along with the rest of the
group of walruses (I'd say all of them). Well, maybe Archie doesn't follow
our fanfic, so I wont send flames there. But, on page 5 of Rotor's story, I
found a very interesting  quote, "It'll take too long to negotiate my sub
that far..." (I carefully checked that to make it letter for letter). Now I
bet you don't see that everyday :')! How would you negotiate a sub?!
Personaly, I enjoy these little script mistakes, makes the comic a lot more
fun (Kind of a Where's Waldo type of thing). And the typo, naturally (or
logically) since it's a correctly spelled word, the word procecor skipped it,
and negotiated with a sub. Maybe the writer's words "negotiate" were put
there because the Sonic comic group is working on some big (or small) Sonic
project (although I think that the odds on this are very small).
      Also in Sonicgrams, there is a mentioning on Knuckles' miniseries #1
comming out in April (I am personally against Knuckles for some reason
<probably due to loyalty to the Hedgehog>), and a Sonic 48-page special,
Super Sonic VS. Hyper Knuckles coming out some time in the future (this
should be interesting). 
      The picture of the front cover of the upcoming comic looks really good.
Maybe the #32 issue will be drawn by one of the more liked artists mentioned
on this list (Hope-Hope).
      Well, I think that that's all I could say on this comic, except that
there is a "Back Issue Order" page that includes Sonic miniseries 1 and 3,
and Sonic "In your face" special. Also it has an order form for all of Tails
mini series (yes, all of them).
      BTW - This comic is Not, I repeat NOT, filled up with slapstick. Maybe
one per story. So there's a good part about this comic too, for all of you
who are fed up with slapstick, or just want to read a normall, not so
childish, comic (Also, Jeofry plants one on Sally twice. Bad Boy). Maybe, as
someone mentioned it with a TMNT comic, the movement towards reality in Sonic
comics has begun. (double Hope-Hope).

A continent is usually thought of as being a very large area.  We do have 
the Floating Island in the comics, and it might be large enough to 
qualify as a continent.  If the Floating Island doesn't move around very 
much, I wonder what life under it would be like (a little shadowy, yes) 
and what sorts of plants would still be able to grow on the ground below.

The comics also introduce the concept of there being >=2 continents on 
the planet with one being where Knothole and M/Robotropolis are and one 
being the home of the Downunda Freedom Fighters.

Only Julian?  I think Snively has more of an IQ than Robotnik thinks -- 
only that he can't show it -- and he could probably tell us too.  And I'm 
sure Sally and Rotor would know too, but of course they aren't people 
(humans).

>Anybody who thinks that this will be annoying, say "I".

I personally am getting quite sick of seing the fan-version Sonic game on
this list and, with all the traffic it's making, would rather see it have
its OWN list... and anyone who would get 'confused' by going between two
lists like that must be either unable to read the FROM line, or else gets
confused very easily and gets my condolences.

Regardless... I have something CONSTRUCTIVE to post to this list concerning
Sonic MATERIALS!!

I just got TWO Sonic the Hedgehog BIRTHDAY CARDS from my sister (who gets me
all kindsa Sonic related stuff whenever she sees 'em!)  :)

Both cards have the same UPC: 074720007540

One card (model 235 BJ170-0438) has a picture of Sonic on the cover,
appearing to clap his hands with a large glittery (with real glitter) set of
smoke clouds behind him.  The inside reads:

WHOOOOSH!
He's burnin',
sneakers churnin'--
Sonic's comin' through...
He's zoomin' fast
and blastin' past
With wishes
just for you!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
HAVE A SUPERSONIC DAY!



The other card (model 235 BJ001-0572) has a picture of Sonic looking
straight at you with fists on his hip and tails right beside him on his
right with a quirky smirk and hobbling up beside Sonic's left side.  Across
the top of the card, in red shiny letters, it reads, "What's a hedgehog to
do..."  The inside reads:

...but wish you a birthday full of Supersonic Fun!


These cards are made in the USA by:

I'd say that there may be OTHER places unexplored.  I mean, com'on, let's
think about this for a second.  Robotnik comes to town for ONE day,
robotisizing EVERYONE.  On such notice, SOME may have gotton
away...to...other, "secret", unheard of places?  Hmm... ponderous.

In the animated series, the Knothole residents are in a dead heat at 16
(cf. my FAQ File for data on determining their ages).  They are all
contemporaries in their mid-teens.  Rosie is a resident of Knothole but
hardly an active FF, so I guess her age doesn't matter.  In the fanfic
division, Bookshire has been described as being in his "mid-30s" [just a
memory for yours truly!].  In one fanfic I'm working on, I have
Bookshire referring to someone as "son" and [in the third person] as
"that boy" -- after all, he is (just barely) old enough to be the father
of some of the freedom fighters.  That would be an interesting angle to
explore for some fanfic writer(s).

Agreed.  Probably the best of the lot.  Based on the page layout of
Sonic #25 it's easy to see why he's not used more often: his style is
too unconventional when compared with other comic artists (which is
probably what I like about it).  His Sally is, indeed, the sexiest.

> Mawhinney:  Very nice style: 'toon, but not childish.  Very consistent, too.

Best "conventional" artist, strong on keeping characters on-model.

> Manak:  Boy, Mawhinney and Spaziante are the best for this comic!
>

The veteran of the series.  Unfortunately, his style is too "cartooney"
by comparison.  Suited to Gallagher's jokey scripts.

> Penders:  Not too bad, but I think he kinda ruined Geoffrey St. John.

So far, this writer-turned-artist has only drawn the Sonic characters
once (#31), having had more experience with the Chaotix cast.  Still
willing to reserve judgment.

Exactly; whatever its technical merits, it's just wrong for these
characters.

"METTLE: characteristic disposition or temperament."

Thus, "Twisted Mettle" is not only a pun, it also describes something
about the character/protagonist(?) of the story.

It's called a dictionary.  Use it.

No more so than a black/white human couple, as long as they get 
married first :^)  One nice thing about the furry stories I've seen is that 
miscegenation (look it up, though a different word probably applies to 
species :^)) isn't much of a problem.

>And yes i know my spelling sucks. try living with it....

Actually, it's your 24-line Batman .sig that I have problems with - it's 
cute the first time, but try deleting it for future posts.  Thanks.

What about Uncle Chuck?  He is on our side now.  I don't recall his exact

Actually, now, you can get the exact birthdates of my characters from the 
Character Profiles link in my stories page.  I replaced their ages with 
birthdates because lots of people were starting to write stories and 
play tinyplots on the MUCKs that took place in lots of different time 
ranges.  In fact, I'll jsut give them to all of you now...

(These are based on the geocentric assumption that Mobius has a twelve 
month calandar and uses our names for the months so everyone can 
understand it)

Already done...eventually, I'll get around to finishing "Memories", a 
story regarding Bookshire's past and events that almost led to him 
becoming a father...but then something happened...something always seems 
to happen, doesn't it.  No details, sorry.  You'll all have to read the 
story once it's done.

Sonic,
	I need to know what time you usually log in at FurryMUCK. Every 
time I go there, you're asleep. I need to find out when I can login, so 
we can work out sleeping arrangements.

Don't do this again!!!
If you need to contact someone on the MUCK, use the MUCK and leave them a 
page mail.

page #mail sonic=your message here

if you didn't know that, then you should have asked someone there, NOT the
list. Ok? I have I made myself clear?

Not that I don't want this to be done or something like that, but if it
features characters created by SEGA then it is in violation of copyright
laws, because if SEGA ever decides to make a PC Sonic game, they would lose
money. Who would buy a Sonic game from SEGA when they could get one for free
over the Net?

Fanfic and Fanart are a bit different because they don't really take profit
away from the company (see ongoing legal discussion with WB in
alt.tv.animaniacs or another group like that).

Like I said I'd like it to be done, but don't think SEGA will ignore it if
they find out about it.

I wouldn't go pushing the game to SEGA after you make it if I were you. They
probably wouldn't be too happy that you decided to make a game for them
without their knowledge and now they're supposed to pay you for it.


Other than that I'm for it, I'd just keep it low profile.

I have nothing against ppl having s*x, no matter what race cread or 
colour....

Its just the image of two or more animals doing it in graphic, and 
explicite imagies, especially where small children could get at it when 
they go looking for sonic stories....

Personally i dont give to figs if you want to go and have fun over them...

If you mean in Knothole, I would have to say Sally is sixteen (Sally, Bunny,
Sonic, Rotor, Dulcy, Tails, and Antoine <listed in random order, I swear> are
the "standard" freedom fighters). In fact, I think that Sally is even older
that 
Sonic. In one of the episodes, Sonic was fifteen, and Sally was sixteen 
throughout the whole year (two seasons). If you are talking about the whole
Mobius, I have NO idea!
Got any disagreements? Send them over.

The first issue I got was drawn by Penders. After that, I seriously
considered
saving my money (but, since it's about my favorite hedgehog, I thought that I

will by it anyway). In the comic that I got, he really did screw up Geoffry 
(sory if I mispelled it in the last post). The only thing I like about his
work, is the (almoust complete) abcense of puns and slapstick. 

BTW - did you even see any of the episodes? If no, I seriously suggest
that you get a hold of a copy.

Well, I'd say he, how yuo said, "succeeded". His only problem is a small
group of people living dangerously too close to him (dangerous for him).
As for these people, all hope is not yet lost. Their families, friends, and
a lot of other people who got captured all over Mobius, are robotocized, and
are safe at the time. The derobotization project is on the way too.

Didn't you say that there were 250 million people yourself?
I'm confused here.

I like the overall line of reasoning, but what about residents of an 
undestroyed village who go visit a destroyed village (not knowing what 
had happened)?  Surely word would get back to the King, and I don't think 
he's foolish enough to not investigate such reports.  Or do we assume 
that inter-village travel is something they just didn't to very much of?
 
Ok, what about the SWAT-bots? They usually patroll these kind of places,
and, By looking at the coup, I'd say they are doing their job well.
In other words, anyone comes into Robotnik's city is in deep stool.
Also, if anyone asks: The roboticized people are mainly, if not only,
from Mobotropolis. Do you(plural) remember in Blast to the Past, the first 
roboticizer was tested on some dog, and then, Sir Charles was the first one
to 
be roboticized after the testing was complete?

There could be a couple of thousand mobians still alive. Not ALL of them
are freedom fighters. And not ALL of them were killed (some were
roboticized).
Also, if there are, say, fifty people in each group (af civilians/freedom-
fighters), that would make for about 20 FF groups (If there are 1000 people
in
their natural state). 2000 would make forty. And I think that 20 - 40 groups
would be a nice estimate.

BTW (or by the way. thaks) since Mobotropolis was the capital of the PLANET,
I would think that there would be quite a lot of people living in it (say
20 million?) and when you add all of the turists, guests, people with
business,
and people who just got lost, I think that the number of civilians (or robots
waitind to be deroboticized) would be quite high. (so stop crying, there
is quite a lot of hope for them yet)

	MDitry,
		I have to tell you that I too am not amused with St. John. I 
didn't like him in the Sally stories and in this issue either. I think the 
inclusion of the beret was stupid and they really need to rethink his character.
I am however going to include him in my second story (if the fist ever gets out) 
and will show him as I think he should. (No, I'm not going to do anything to 
destroy his character) The story will also include Nomad, (not myself, the 
character created by me who I use the name of) and his relation (he's a skunk) 
to St. John. (not a real good one)
		So I guess that's all,
				Nomad

Well, I know Mighty (my charachter) was 17.  I say "was" because he was
"de-aged" to suite a certain Vixie Lamenta, who was only 10.  She aged to
12, I (Mighty) "de-aged" to 12, that way we could be closer in age.

Princess Sally?  Age wise, I don't know,....I DO know she was VERy stuck-up
before Robotnik took over....an oppinion, but I think ol' Julian was the
best thing that ever happened to her, (which you see in eppisode negitive
one (-1))
Anyone agree/disagree? In fact, if it weren't 4 the takeover, would Sonic &
Sally ever have met to begin with/?  Hmm.... something to PONDER! :)

You have a point there. I can't think of anyone older except for the bad
guys.
 
BTW - Isn't Sally a little older than Sonic?

And SOME did (MOST of them are called Freedom Fighters). One of these 
"unexplored" places could be the Great Unknown. And the map that I was
talking about was sort of a space-ship's eye vew of the planet. Also on the
ONE day... was it really one day, or did Robotnik live in Mobotropolis for a 
while before taking it over?

Is there a floating Island in our fanfic? I didn't know about that.
(As I have said before, for some reason, I am against Knuckles, and
everythyng related, for some reason) The issue about the size of the
"island," on the map, it looked like a small island compared to the
main continent, but considering the size of the main continent (and
if Mobius is roughly the size of Earth <whith that I disagree>) that
island would be just a bit smaller than Australia. (while the main
continent would be something like Africa and Eurasia put together)

I don't know which comic, so I can't help you there (sorry :') ).

I still think (this is an opinion) that Robotnik has a higher IQ that
Snively,
but when I said that he would know, I meand that he has acces to his main
computer, and that computer would get the most presice data, with all those
Robotnik's spy satalites. Sally's Nicole would probably give a good display
of the map, but the only one it(she? <could Nicole be considered sentient?>)
can display, would be the last one it got (and who knows when that happened).
As for rotor, he's an inventor/mechanic, not a geografer.
Again, I am only talking about the main (or DiC's <first, if you will>) 
freedom fighters, not the later ones that were created in the stories.

They did seem to know each other as kids in "Blast To The Past".  Uncle 
Chuck was working for the King, and Sonic hung out with him sometimes, so 
Sally would have had opportunities to meet him.

But what might their relationship be like if not for the coup?  Would 
Sally still have any interest in Sonic?

    Here following is the parts so far finished of Other Sonics:The

the mail service I have (a Wildcat BBS) only allows me at most 150 lines

     Part the third

     Son-Ak stared at all of the dishes laid at the Princess'
table.  Fine meats, breads, cheeses, vegetables, soups, wines,
ales...  And all to his way of thinking inedible.  A barbarian's
tastes invariably run to simpler fare.  But the ingredient's were
there, and so he began the rather peculiar construction of a
sausage and bread layer again.
     Sniffing at a thick, reddish-brown stew, he asked, "What's
this?  Smells good."
     The princess thought for a moment, and replied, "Well, it's a
sort of spiced bean and meat stew.  Onions, red peppers, some
spices...  Not a favorite of mine, actually, but the cook loves to
make it."
     Son-Ak paused, then ladles some of it onto the sausage
construct.  Tentatively, he took a bite--
     And smiled.  Widely.  "Perfect.  The perfect food.  At last,
I have found the perfect food."
     "Sausage, bread, cheese and bean stew is the perfect food?"
whispered Bunnie to her Princess.
     "It would seem to be," replied Salar-Alicia.  "Look at him!"
     Bunnie stared in open-mouth disbelief as the hedgehog rapidly
constructed six of the bizarre items, and wolfed them down with
unexpected speed.  "The PERFECT food!"
     As he began to pull at a mug of ale, the guard captain shook
her head.  Her princess was obviously taken with the stranger, and
she wasn't sure that that was wise at all.  Princesses weren't
meant to be close to commoners, much less to fast-eating
barbarians.


     Son-Ak's idea of the perfect food was being shared at that
moment by Tail's gang of street-rats.  Oh, they hadn't created the
odd compound that the barbarian had, but Tail's theft had paid for
bread, cheese, sausages, and some (rather thin) bean stew, as well
as a jug of sour wine that they had cut with water.   To the
princess, or even the hedgehog, the meal would have been sparse.
To the assembled urchins, it was a feast as grand as any at the
palace (or so they fondly believed, in a Cratchet-like fashion).
     The four younger ones were as happy as clams (Hmm... You know,
that's a rather unusual phrase.  I mean, how happy can a clam be?
No brain, almost no nervous system, existing only for the purpose
of chowder, but I digress) but Milos was somewhat more somber.  The
silver piece had bought a deal of foodstuffs, but it was gone now,
and such a lucky haul was not a regular occurrence.  At the age of
eleven years he was a bit more of a realist than his gang.  True,
his unusual gift of flight gave him some advantage, but not
enough...  Not to steal something worth stealing.
     Besides, if he were to go for a real prize, it would certainly
attract the attention of the Guild of Thieves, who might not care
about a wild urchin grabbing the occasional silver, but would
certainly be annoyed at one not in the Brotherhood performing any
real theft.  And there was always the small, nagging guilt he felt
at each pickpocketing.
     If there were only some alternative.  But he had to keep his
charges fed, somehow, and the number of jobs for an eleven year old
fox could be counted on the fingers of his left foot.  At best he
could gain apprenticeship to some brute, for little more than food
or board, and that would not help his friends...
     A thought occurred to him.  There was enough food for tomorrow
as well, except bread.  Sometimes the Palace cooks could be
persuaded to give a crust of three to a appropriately pitiful
looking waif.
     "Cleth, come with me.  We're going to see if we can get any
bread for tomorrow.  Get pathetic."
     Cleth, the kitten, grinned.  Only five years of age, he often
treated the plots that Tails cooked up like a game, and "get
pathetic" was one of his favorites.  Removing the ragged but clean
tunic he wore (Tails insisted on keeping what clothing they had in
as good repair as possible, and even on weekly bathing-- to cut
down on odors that might give them away) he donned a mass of dirty,
shredded rags that made him look as though he had not eaten in a
month, had been beaten daily in compensation, and more like three
or four years old.  He opened his eyes wide, until they resembles
something that in another universe would have been painted on black
velvet, and generated a hint of a practiced tear.  Perhaps even
Roboth-amon would have had a moment of tenderness at the kitten's
demeanor.
     And so Tails and Cleth set out on what was planned as a
begging expedition, but what would turn out to be-- aw, you know.


     As two cubs set out for the back of the palace, a black-clad
figure also made his way towards the royal residence.  Holding a
small green stone with obscure glyphs inscribed upon it, Sniv
effortlessly scales a wall, entered a window, and hid the item
under a bed.
     Leaving as silently as he had come, the master thief and spy
of the eastlands returned to his room at the disreputable inn he
was patronizing.  Again he withdrew the mirror that was his means
of communication with his dark master.  (Yes, I know, but the
phrase Dark Master is traditional in this kind of fantasy.)
     "It is in place, Master,"  Sniv said quietly.  "Um... If I may
ask, what is it?"
     Again the mirror swirled, again the shadowed form of Roboth-
amon  appeared.  "A beacon of sorts, Sniv.  A beacon for a spell of
transport.  Also a window into the mirrors of the princess's
chambers.  I shall see just how capable this barbarian is for
myself.  Then, after I appraise him... I shall break him."
     And even the hardened soul of Sniv the Unseen, master spy of
the Eastrealm, shuddered at the cold laughter that emanated from
the mirror...

     Most of the females he'd seen in his travels in the south had
been dressed either in simple tunics and dresses (if poor) or in
silks and gold (if wealthy, and rather skimpy if they had the looks
for it).  This one was garbed, instead, in a black leather halter
and trunks, with tall boots of the same material and plated
gauntlets.  The rabbit's ear was bent, at least one was, but her
eyes were those of a warrior, and the large two-handed sword she
had cast on her back was not any city maiden's toy.  That she
could-- and did-- carry such a weapon meant she considered herself
a fighter.  The thin scar across her left eye (fortunate to have
missed the eye itself) meant she was.  And that no other scars were
visible meant she was a warrior of skill.
     "Captain Rabbot," blurted the innkeeper.  "You should have
seen him, he--"
     "I saw, innkeeper," she interrupted.  "You-- I think you'd
better come with me."
     Son-ak tightened his grip on his axe.  "If there's some idiot
law against aiding innkeepers here against demon-tricks--"
     The rabbit laughed.  "By Mosthe', no, swift one.  But anyone
who can fight like that-- and with such an unusual technique-- will
interest my mistress immensely.  Besides, there's a bounty of five
royals for each of the dark Wizard's toys wrecked.  You've made a
pretty penny today, Son-ak, and I merely thought you'd like to
collect it."
     "Your mistress.  And who is that?  For that, who are you?"
     "I," replied the rabbit, "Am Captain Bunnie,  in service to
her Highness, the Princess Salar-Alicia of House Acorn, and leader
of her Royal Guards.  And I already... ah... 'heard' of you,
hedgehog.  You want your fifteen royals or not?"
     Son-ak grinned.  After weeks of boredom, things were looking
up.  A good fight, gold to refill his almost empty purse, and he'd
met a female of both obvious bravery and courage-- and, not that he
allowed himself to notice, beauty as well.  Yes, perhaps his
fortunes were changing for the better...

     To the east, a massive form shuddered.  A hand clutched a
glittering stone, and a quiet snarl escaped thick lips.
     "Sniv.  To me.  Now."
     The shadows produced a short, black swathed figure.  "My
lord?"
     "Something in the west has destroyed three of my iron golems
in as many moments.  And when I am about to begin my true plans,
that is an ill matter.  Ill indeed...You are my master spy, Sniv
the Quiet.  Go forth, go and learn what causes me such concern at
this time."
     "As you command, Master."  The figure melted back into the
shadows.
     And Roboth-amon, the Dark Wizard of the East, mused on the
possibility-- for the first time-- that his designs might be in
peril.



               Part the second

     The City of Mobius was, simply put, large.  Larger than
anything Son-Ak had ever seen, or even dreamed of seeing.  To Son-
ak, born and bred amongst the barbarian tribes of the north, a
village was large in his mind.  A town was huge.  A city was
something he had never even conceived of.
     And the City called Mobius was the largest in the known world.
     Simply put, the hedgehog was steeling every nerve in his body
to keep from freaking.
     An old cliche', true, but an accurate one-- the sounds, the
smells, the sights, and above all the people-- the teeming crowds
of people-- of all the different races of the world, talking,
bargaining, arguing, flirting, debating, all in one place that was
larger than the hedgehog had ever dreamed possible-- that was
larger than he COULD have dreamed, in fact-- buying, selling,
dealing...
     Well, he could be forgiven.  The Great Marketplace of Mobius
could stagger even the most jaded of travelers.  It was a violent
sensory overload that numbed the body of all but the most obvious
of stimuli.
     So it is no surprise that the normally alert barbarian never
noticed the small, stealthy hand slip under his belt, lift his
(severely depleted) purse, and make off with it.
     The little thief slipped into an alleyway, looked about to be
certain that no-one had seen him, and then removed his tattered
cloak.  Clad now in only a battered loincloth and a equally
disreputable vest, he rolled up the cloak, bent slightly over, and
began to spin what proved to twin tails, slowly at first, then
faster, until he rose in the air.  He lifted himself to a rooftop,
donned the cloak again, and then began to run and leap from roof to
roof, until he found the abandoned garret he called home.
     "Tails!" cried a younger child, a small kitten.  "You found
anything today?"
     Milos, the street-thief more commonly known in the gutters and
alleyways as "Tails", opened the pouch, grinning.  "Oh, not much...
just a few coppers and a SILVER piece.  We can feast tonight!"
     The gathered children of Tails' gang gave a ragged cheer.
Poor, abandoned, and without any other form of support, the four
cubs looked upon their leader with undisguised admiration.  A
silver coin might be little to the spendthrift hedgehog, but to
five small half-starved kids it meant bread, cheese, ale (no-one
would drink the water in the City) and even some sausages or cold
meats.
     "Where did you get it?"  asked another.
     "He stole it, you doof," retorted the oldest of the four, a
rather sour-looking ferret.
     "I know that," replied the rabbit-child.  "But where?"
     The kitten and the youngest-- a five- year old skunk-- gazed
at their leader in awe, as he replied, "Oh, just some wandering
barbarian... huge one, with a honking great axe."
     "Wow.  Weren't you scared?"
     " Maybe a little... not of him, of course.  But he WAS walking
with ol' Cap'n Rabbot."
     The ferret's usual expression of sour boredom loosened a bit
at that.  "You mean you filched it with Rabbot there?  That's awful
dangerous, ain't it?"
     "Maybe...  but she's not likely to catch me.  And that
barbarian was so city-struck I could've grabbed that axe, and his
tunic, and likely his underwear and he still wouldn't have
noticed."  Tails grinned, and then laughed.  "Besides, even if he
had, he'd never have caught me.  He's a hedgehog.  And you know how
slow they are."

     Elsewhere, the hedgehog in question discovered what had
happened.  And was indulging himself in a litany of unusually
imaginative curses.
     "As though you had lost anything of import.  You had a few
coppers, and single silver, true?  And you're about to receive
fifteen royals-- gold royals at that.  By Mosthe', we'll even throw
in a new purse."  Bunnie looked at the incensed barbarian with ill-
concealed amusement.
     "Not the point, Bent-ear.  Someone stole from ME-- Me, Son-Ak
of the Cad-Hai, the swift one, the runner, the--"
     "The compulsive whiner about trifles.  "Now, hold your tongue
and your temper.  The princess isn't impressed with either brags or
curses."
     Son-ak grudgingly complied.  He was not looking forward to
meeting this city-princess, no doubt some homely inbred noblewoman
with an inflated ego and a temper to match, with few wits and no
forethought, and almost certainly--
     Then he was ushered into the audience hall by Bunnie, and for
a moment, Son-Ak, the swift, the runner, the warrior, forgot to
breathe.
     Salar-Alicia, Princess of House Acorn, was a slender, well
formed ground squirrel.  A mane of red-brown hair was contrasted by
eyes of a deep, almost hypnotic green.  Dressed in white silks with
gold trim, (and frankly, not a great deal of them)  white sandals,
and a simple tiara of office, she was simply the most beautiful
creature Son-AK had ever seen.  (And when you're a travelling
barbarian adventurer , who spends most of his non-combat time in
taverns and bars, with the requisite scantily-clad exotic dancing
girls, you see a lot of beautiful creatures.)
     "This is the warrior you spoke of, Captain?"
     The warrior-bunny stepped forward, and knelt.  "Yes, my
Princess.  Three of Roboth-amon's iron men smashed by him.  I
thought you would like to see such a marvel."
     "Indeed."  Salar-Alicia rose from the couch she had been lying
on, and strode over to the dumbstruck hedgehog.  "You hadn't
mentioned that he was so handsome, though."
     Son-ak just stood, transfixed at the proximity of the girl of
his dreams before him.  Something inside him clamored for him to
say something-- anything-- and in horror he heard himself say,
"Aren't those clothes drafty?"
     Salar-Alicia blinked.  And then began to giggle.  "And he's
witty too!"  She fell back onto the couch, laughing.
     Bunnie Rabbot was at that moment thinking very hard about
throwing herself on her sword.  _Idiot barbarian..._
     Son-Ak was thinking similar thoughts... but realized that axes
were impractical for such actions.  _Maybe I can borrow bent-ear's
sword..._
     The princess/ mirth wound to a stop.  "Oh, well... Warrior,
when you are a princess, there are certain expectations that the
people have of you.  They expect me to be beautiful and alluring,
and unapproachable.  Besides, if you can pull it off, why not?  I
admit that this style of dress may not be practical, but I do not
need to be practical."  She sighed, and added, "Once I am Queen,
then I move into gowns and gold.  Tradition is a complex thing...
And I am bound by it."
     "Oh," replied Son-Ak.  "Well... um... you wear it well.
Royalty, I mean, not the... AH, that is, you..."
     Salar-Alicia grinned.  "Bunnie, when are you going to
introduce me to a male that doesn't react like this?"
     The rabbit sighed," When you gain twenty-five pounds and start
wearing a grain sack. "  She stood, and grinned.  "But it's a
fairly effective defense, I suppose, throwing a possible opponent
off guard."
     The princess frowned.  "Must you see everything in terms of
defense or offense?"
     "Zat is 'er duty, Highness.  As mine is to protect you in
making ze spells, nest pas'?"
     Son-Ak turned to meet the new voice.  The vulpine stood
unimpressed, clad in a long elaborate robe, with a tangled mane of
gold hair falling about his shoulders.  He carried a staff of
gnarled oak, and an expression of hauteur that almost immediately
antagonized the hedgehog.
     "Ah.  The other of my closest aides.  Son-Ak, meet Antos, my
personal sorcerer."
     Antos looked at Son-Ak with undisguised disdain, which changed
to suspicion.  "Princess.  Zat is the magic I am sensing."  He
pointed to the hedgehog.  "Zat... person, he is stinking of magic.
He is enchanted."
     Son-Ak growled.  "Enchanted, spell-weaver?  There's no magic
in me."
     Antos walked over to the barbarian, and sniffed.  Before
Son-Ak could react, he nodded.  "Non.  Not you, but ze axe.  Zat
axe is ze magical blade."  He walked away, muttering.
     Bunnie sighed, "Never mind Antos, Son-Ak.  He's a sorcerer.
All sorcerers are a bit peculiar."
     Son-Ak stood bewildered.  "My axe is magic?"
     The princess smiled.  "If Antos says it is, then it is."
     The barbarian hesitated.  "Bah.  That spellweaver's nose is
broken.  I've no magic, and neither has this blade."  He paused for
a moment, and suddenly blurted, "And where's my money?"
     Again the princess laughed.  "Why, I had almost forgotten."
She picked up a small purse, and tossed it to the hedgehog.  Son-Ak
caught it, and grinned himself at the heavy and satisfying feels of
gold.
     "Perhaps you will dine with me tonight?  I hear little of the
world outside Mobius, and should like to hear of your adventures."
     "And I know he's gonna LOVE to tell you about them," muttered
Bunnie under her breath...


     The dark clad figure dropped from the windowsill, into the
shadows.  Scurrying from alley to alley, he made his way to a less
than reputable tavern, where he climbed the back wall to another
window, and climbed in.
     Throwing back his hood, he revealed a human face (one of the
rarer races in the land), sharp, with an almost dagger-like nose
and a think unruly mane of brown hair.  He reached into a pocket
hidden in his tunic, and bought out a small, oddly shaped mirror.
     "Master," he hissed.  The mirror seemed to ripple for a
moment, and then to clear, showing the shadowy figure of Roboth-
amon.
     "Yes, Sniv?"  the wizard of the East replied.  "What have you
found out?"
     "Your golems were destroyed by one person, Master.  A
hedgehog, with an enchanted axe."  Sniv paused, and added, "A big
hedgehog.  Blue, a northerner.  And the Princess seems taken with
him, rather."
     "A hedgehog.  I've little liking for the idea that my greatest
plan is to be spoiled by a hedgehog.  Keep spying, Sniv, and keep
me informed.  Meanwhile, I shall prepare a present for this
interloper..."

     Other Sonics #1-- The Barbarian : Part One

     By Robert Haynie

     Obligatory stuff-- Sonic the Hedgehog, Bunnie Rabbot, etc. TM
and copyright 1995 by Sega of America and Archie Comics.  They
probably reserve all rights.  This story is copyright 1995 Robert
S. Haynie Jr.  This is an exercise in fan fiction, and is not
meant to infringe on their rights, but is a purely recreational

     Foreword:

     In more than one issue of the STH comic the so-called "Cosmic
Interstate" has been mentioned.  Most noted was issue #19 (I
believe), "Night of a Thousand Sonics", which noted that there were
(in theory) many, many versions of the hedgehog.  But what are
these other realms like?  What are the others like in them?  Is
Bunnie always such a babe in them (Sorry, that just slipped out)?
Let us look at one...  Offramp #14-a-347-bx-2, Mobs in the age of
high fantasy...

     Prologue

     "Know, oh Prince. that in the age of the House of Acorn, when
a darkness rose from the bitter East to cleave the Kingdom and to
bring strife and misery to the children of Karuis, there came Son-
Ak, a thief, a reaver, a runner, who had sought only adventure but
found himself n the path of heroes, who won a crown and a bride by
the strength of his good right arm and the swiftness of his feet.
Or something like that.  I really don't remember, I haven't had
enough sleep."
          The chronicles of Mandar the Insomniac


     Part the first

     It was mostly rain that day, rain and mud, and the lost
warrior trudged through the thick gruel that water and dust had
made of the road with an expression of bitter annoyance and a heart
filled with growing mayhem.  In time, he came to a roadside tavern,
and entered with considerable depression.
     A barmaid took a single look at him and quailed.
Understandably, for the warrior was an intimidating sort.  Tall for
a hedgehog-- over three feet, in fact-- clad in a hide tunic and
boots, and carrying a large battleaxe on his back,  he had the
still visible marks of battle scars under his frontal fur.  His
quills were longer and sharper than the usual for his kind, and
were styled in an intimidating blade-like fashion,  and were of
the blue color peculiar to the barbarian tribes of the northlands.
     The warrior took a seat at an unoccupied table, and the
barmaid, urged on by the tavern keeper, approached uncertainly.
Her life wasn't the easiest, and she feared that the fearsome
stranger would grab at her, or yell, or something frightening.  But
he merely growled for ale and food, tossing a few copper coins
down-- enough to pay for his desires.  And sulked.
     "Man, I HATE rain."
     After a few moment, the barmaid bought a plate of sausages and
cheese, some bread, and a pitcher of ale to the table.  She began
to leave, when the hedgehog began to do something odd.  First he
cut two slender pieces of bread from the loaf, then placed a
sausage on one, scraped off bits of cheese onto it, sighed, and
covered the whole with the other slice of bread.  "Wish I had some
stew for this,"  he mumbled quietly.  "Always goes better with some
stew."
     The stranger ate in silence then, silence unbroken except for
the sipping of ale and the occasional unquiet burp.
     "He's... not very polite," whispered the barmaid to the
innkeeper.
     "Look at his dress, lass.  He's a barbarian, a northern
warrior.  You think he's used to doilies and fingerbowls?"
     "As though you had any," sniffed the barmaid, and returned to
the other customers.
     The hedgehog finished his meal in (relative) silence, and paid
for a room in back.  He entered, still silent, still sulking.  And
fell into a fitful sleep...

     speed... the speed of the Chosen... blue wind and golden
fire...

     The noise of the barmaid's screams broke the hedgehog's
unpleasant dream.  With long-practiced reflexes he leapt to his
feet, grabbed his axe, and cast open his door.  He didn't really
expect anything-- perhaps some patron who had drank too much and
could not handle it too well had got too "friendly", at worst some
bandits of some sort-- whatever, it would hardly be any--
     For a second, the warrior thought they were soldiers of some
sort, in strange armor.  But the movements were wrong, there were
no joints.  The barbarian realized that they were statues of some
dark metal, bought to life by some hellish spell.
     For the first time in weeks, Son-ak the Blue grinned.
     Almost casually he began to whirl his battleaxe in a circle,
but rather than the usual two or three swings most would have used,
(to intimidate)  Son-ak continued to spin the blade, faster and
faster, until it was a silvery circle above his head.  And then,
with a blood-chilling war cry, he charged the demon-statues.
     Where a common blade-stroke would have hardly bent the metal
of the enchanted figures, the whirling axe struck with such force
that the metal parted.  Green fire erupted from the cracked shell
of the statue, and the figure collapsed into shards of broken
metal.  The two remaining figures turned towards this unexpected
interruption.
     Son-ak suddenly threw his axe at one, and leapt at the second,
tucking into a rolling ball in mid-leap.  The axe cracked one
statue, and-- amazingly-- Son-ak opened the other with flailing
quills.  Both spat the same green flame, both crumbled into scraps
of metal.
     The innkeeper stared at the remains of the three figures, and
at the now wildly grinning hedgehog, who threw back his head and
howled a barbaric cry of defiance and victory.  Then he turned his
attentions to the barmaid, who had collapsed after she had
screamed.
     "Hah!  I'd thought that there wasn't anything to do here!  You
ought to have told me of such entertainment, innkeeper!"
     "Entertainment," spat the innkeeper.  "You may call it
entertainment, Barbarian, but no one here would.  We've had enough
grief from the Dark Wizard before.  Still, my thanks for stopping
those golems.  I've never seen such bladework before with an axe."
     "Aye," grinned the hedgehog,"And ye won't soon see it again!
I am Son-ak of the Cad-hai, the Swift one, the runner past the
wind, the Striker!  I run swifter than a thunderclap, strike harder
thana the lightning--"
     "And boast louder than a donkey," came a dry voice from
behind.
     "And boast louder than a donkey!  I-- Hey, wait a minute,"
sputtered Son-ak.  He turned about, to face the new speaker.
"That's hardly polite, bent-ear."
     "Spare me a barbarian's etiquette," replied the newcomer.
Son-ak frowned, even as he sized up the speaker.
     Most of the females he'd seen in his travels in the south had
been dressed either in simple tunics and dresses (if poor) or in
silks and gold (if wealthy, and rather skimpy if they had the looks
for it).  This one was garbed, instead, in a black leather halter
and trunks, with tall boots of the same material and plated
gauntlets.  The rabbit's ear was bent, at least one was, but her
eyes were those of a warrior, and the large two-handed sword she
had cast on her back was not any city maiden's toy.  That she
could-- and did-- carry such a weapon meant she considered herself
a fighter.  The thin scar across her left eye (fortunate to have
missed the eye itself) meant she was.  And that no other scars were
visible meant she was a warrior of skill.

Please, don't post anymore game related questions to the list, if you do,
neither me nor Mighty will reply to them. (Not even via private Email). If=
 you=20
to know somthing post to us directly.. please.

This is the Sonic list, it's not right to flood it with 40 messages that
could be answered by a simple FAQ file. (I'll see about getting one up on
Mighty's page..) Also, if there is sufficient interest, I will see about
getting a game list.

Please note, Erich and Ratman *AREN'T* the bad guys here.. we are.. we're
the ones clogging their list which they give to us freely and kindly...
let's not be jerks and take over...

They may be the same age chronologically, but Sally has always struck me
as being more mature than Sonic.  A fine distinction but an important
one.

[Note: Funny, I'd have thought someone else would have commented on this
issue by now.  Oh,well.  Spoilers ahead, yadda yadda yadda...]

#32 [March 1996]
   Cover art: Pat Spaziante seems to be making his mark as a cover
artist, and a dynamic one at that.  And he continues to push the outside
of the envelope in his drawings of Sally.  Talk about a tail to
astonish....!
   "Blast From The Past" (3 parts)
   Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Art Mawhinney
The Knothole Freedom Fighters are somewhere in the mountains when
they're attacked by SWATbots.  One of them gets off a laser shot that
severs the rope that Sally has been climbing.  She begins to fall to her
doom....
   and this is just the first panel!  
   Tails catches Sally on the fly as the freedom fighters make
their escape.  However, they run into other SWATbots with a
robodog...which just happens to be Sonic's old pet, Muttski.  However,
the impending attack is broken off by Uncle Chuck using a device that
looks like a remote control for a toy car.  Antoine then tumbles into a
gorge where he discovers...  I'm sorry, but Mawhinney's talent totally
fails to make his rendition of a frozen prehistoric "Mobian bear" very
convincing--especially when compared with his rendition of a polar bear
later in this issue.  The two don't look anything alike.  The
prehistoric bear (dubbed "Mobie" by Tails) looks more like a hulked-out
version of that obnoxious animal from the Honeycomb cereal commercials
on TV (note to overseas readers who don't get American TV: you're not
missing a thing!).  Rotor suggests that they take Mobie back to Knothole
to revive him.
   Sonic accidentally causes a speedup in the thawing process and Mobie
promptly begins running amok.  Bunnie trees Mobie until he calms down.
Anti-Mobie sentiment begins to grow (Antoine: "He is ze librarian!"
Sally : "I think you mean 'barbarian,' Antoine."  Just for the record
I'M the librarian, and I have the Master's degree in library science to
prove it!  But enough about me....).  Bunnie, however, tries using
pictures to communicate with Mobie; since he was holding a paint brush
in one hand when he was found, she thinks he may have an artistic side.
Mobie takes one look at the group drawing of Bunnie's, has a dim memory
of his own family unit, and runs away from Knothole to look for them.
Sonic gives chase, reluctantly.
   Finding Mobie by a nearby mountain surrounded by SWATbots, Sonic
comes to his rescue.  Mobie returns the favor when Sonic manages to
knock himself out and almost gets chomped by Muttski.  Snoic has to do
some quick drawing in the dirt before Mobie tries taking Muttski apart.
The story is wrapped up in short order: Muttski's mind is restored and
Mobie is dropped off in a Mobian jungle.
   Pretty good action yarn hampered by an unbelievable "cave bear."  I
suppose by making bears the sapient species instead of primates,
evolution on Mobius took a different turn.  But I'll leave that to the
theoreticians on the list -- I'm a Mobian creationist myself ;-) .
   "Prisoners"
   Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders/Art: Ken Penders
   Yet another 2-page installment in the Chinese water torture that is
being passed off as a Knuckles story.  Espio, Charmy, Mighty and Vector
are trapped somewhere and encounter a shadowy figure wearing the same
digger-style hat as Knack the Weasel.
   "Tundra Road" Part 2
   Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
   We left Rotor sinking to his doom in the waters of the North Sea.
One other fan has summed up the situation best: we know Rotor will be
saved; the question is, will his rescue be as contrived as Tails' rescue
from the roboticizer in "Growing Pains, Part 2"?  As it turns out, Rotor
is indeed saved by two of the polar Mobians left over from "Way Way Past
Cool" (Sonic #26): Sealia the seal (who didn't have any lines the first
time but who has now acquired a copy of Antoine's dimestore French
accent) and Augustus the polar bear.  Using a literal Trojan horse
gambit, Rotor and the two polar Mobians invade the ice cave where the
walrus herd is still gathered, but Robotnik orders the brainwashed herd
to destroy Rotor.  The polar Mobians separate Rotor from the herd by
setting the herd adrift on an ice floe.  Rotor vows to return to release
the herd from Robotnik's influence...if the zombified herd doesn't die
of starvation in the meantime.  Oh well, at least Manak took a break
from doing the artwork.
   Sonic grams: same old office humor.  Hype for Super Sonic v.
Hyper-Knuckles special issue (story by Gallagher *ack!*/art by
Mawhinney).  One letter concerns Sonic's sneakers and there's some
teasing of Knuckles' story in issues 33-36.

Two reasons: while I think we enjoy reading each other's reviews of the 
comics, they don't seem to generate much discussion, thus why bother?

Also, you do such a good job of skewering the stories, er, pointing out 
areas for improvement :^) that you're a hard act to follow (or precede, or 
whatever :^))

Indeed; I did a double take at that, and almost went for a triple, but 
decided I'd better just read the story :^)

To quote Babs: "how conveeenient"; at least he wasn't cooking chili dogs 
this time around...

Off-topic tangent: I'm not sure which is more annoying: Sugar Bear trying 
to steal Granny's Super Sugar, er, Honey, er, whatever, Crisp, or Dig'Em 
the Frog doing the same thing to a cat minding his own business...

>   Sonic accidentally causes a speedup in the thawing process and Mobie

Nice action sequence with Bunnie, but I'm afraid I'm beginning to agree 
with Chris Baird's assessment of her depiction as a "kewpie doll"...

>Anti-Mobie sentiment begins to grow (Antoine: "He is ze librarian!"
>Sally : "I think you mean 'barbarian,' Antoine."  Just for the record
>I'M the librarian, and I have the Master's degree in library science to

I'm tempted to ask if the job market for that would be worth the time and 
effort for me to get one of those after 14+ years in electronics 
engineering, but that's a subject for e-mail :^)

>knock himself out and almost gets chomped by Muttski.  Snoic has to do
                                                        ^^^^^
Might want to fix that for the official FAQ :^)

>some quick drawing in the dirt before Mobie tries taking Muttski apart.
>The story is wrapped up in short order: Muttski's mind is restored and

And of course he'll get over the loss of his family, etc., etc....

Boy, could we start a discussion/flamewar (not between you and me -
I'm a creationist too) on _that_ one :^)  I have my own opinion on 
religion and furries, but since it's all hypothetical and we've got enough 
problems with religion and _humans_, why argue about it?

Nice review, as usual!

This may be a stupid question to ask....but i will anyway.....

In Bam Sally comments on getting new boots after super speeding ...I 
take it she wore them out....  Yet we never see nore here anything about 
Sonic needing to get new sneakers. Are they of some special construction 
to withstand his speed, and if so, why dosnt sally get a pair?????

Well that me thrown the train of thought enough for one posting, later..

How many children are there on the net?
How many can utilise the rat site?
How many wouldn't be put off?
Those who pass these points are obviously mature enough to see those images.

At least Sally is more mature than Sonic. 
Dulcy seems to me to be younger than the other FFs, as she isn't able to 
lay eggs and talks like a young child, or are dragons just growing slower?

Agreed; I wonder how much of that is the characters vs. the voice artists 
behind them...

Maybe Elmyra-ism is a universal concept :^)  (For non-Tiny-Toon Adventures 
fans: Cree Summer voice both Elmyra (a basic dim bulb) and Dulcy.)

It was very easy to find the images before.
But the real issue is it's mean to have a server that is appealing to
children, then expose them to dirty pictures.
Regardless of what you think of the images, think of it from a parent's 
point of view.
And yes I wish they didn't market cartoons/video games to children, but this
is just how it is! :-(

Actually, I should not be a hyprocrite. This is interesting to me of course
since it involved my server, but I think this is kind of off topic...

Sy:

It's already been established in the comics, in Teitelbaum's adaptation
of same, and even in the Archie Sonic-Grams, that Sonic's Uncle Chuck
had to develop Sonic's high-tech sneakers.  Apparently he wore out too
many pair when he was a kid.

As I remember it, in "Blast To The Past" even before the coup, Sonic and 
Sally were playing together (I think they were playing tag). It looked as 
if they were best friends at the time. So, I guess not having the coup would 
not alter their relationships (except for the fact that the coup brought 
Sonic and Sally closer together, and, since they are so close together now, 
made them "In like" -(sonicgrams #31) ).

Has anyone ever explained the roboticization process in some (imaginary) 
detail?  I think it'd be a bit interesting to know somewhat how it works 
(or, theoretically how it should work).

Speaking of Sonic movies, whatever happen to that live action Sonic movie
someone posted about a while ago?
Is it being made? Was it canned? Or was it just an idea that never made it
off the drawing board?

Not that I don't want this to be done or something like that, but if it
features characters created by SEGA then it is in violation of copyright
laws, because if SEGA ever decides to make a PC Sonic game, they would lose
money. Who would buy a Sonic game from SEGA when they could get one for free
over the Net?

Fanfic and Fanart are a bit different because they don't really take profit
away from the company (see ongoing legal discussion with WB in
alt.tv.animaniacs or another group like that).

Like I said I'd like it to be done, but don't think SEGA will ignore it if
they find out about it.

I wouldn't go pushing the game to SEGA after you make it if I were you. They
probably wouldn't be too happy that you decided to make a game for them
without their knowledge and now they're supposed to pay you for it.


Other than that I'm for it, I'd just keep it low profile.

Agreed.  I also should have mentioned that I liked the sequence where
Mobie rescues Sonic before he becomes robodog chow.  Like the opening
sequence of the prologue to the Sally miniseries (#20) -- I'm a sucker
for sequences where there's no dialogue and the story has to be told
visually.

When I graduated in the late 70s, the job market for librarians was
horrible!  At the time, a lot of libraries were pooling their resources
and joining consortia.  Things may be different now because so many
libraries are being impacted by the information revolution or whatever
you call it.

I'm really beginning to get bugged by the tendency to wrap up/dispose of
stories by the last page, no matter how nonsensical the solution.  It's
a sign of bad writing, period.

Hard to tell.  She's in two long shots; in one of them, she COULD have
legs but it's hard to tell.  Call it artistic license.

Now that you mention it, when I saw the panel with him getting the cliched 
light-bulb to represent an idea, I thought a candle or oil lamp would have 
been more fitting for a prehistoric bear/ape/whatever, but the point probably 
would've gone over the kiddies' heads :^)

I'm thinking of the Robotisation Chamber as a modified Star Trek (or
"The Fly 1986") -like transporter that modifies everything in situ..
(Nanites might take longer to complete the process than is desired.)
The process might start on the limbs first, replacing the nerves,
skeleton, et al, with digital analogues, fabricating any extra
hardware and disintegrating the squishy wet stuff..

The guts of the entire thing is just your general energy/solid matter
conversion-- any good Energy Systems textbook written after 2130 will
detail the process in better detail than I could explain here.  With
the cybernetics, the Chambers have a database of standard designs and
interpolate according to the subject's species.  (The original model
Robotisation Chamber had insufficiently annotated data to deal with
some primitive Bird and Reptile genera, so during the War it was
typical to exterminate these subjects.  Most of the larger reptiles
couldn't fit inside the Chambers anyway. :)

[I think I'll quit now before I make a bigger rambling idiot of myself. :]

For a Derobotisation process, it would just be the comparatively
trivial process of removing the synthetic parts and referring to
the subject's DNA to reconstruct the original flesh.

I've already suggested before that Bunnie and the other 'bots
would most definitely need a cybernetic maintenence system (like
the biological immune system & etc), if just to keep the synthetic
parts from wearing down.  I supposed that the CEM would already
be intelligent enough from everyday operation to have enough smarts
for adapting to Bunnie's case.  (NB that Bunnie doesn't have the
bone marrow to create enough blood cells any more..)  I've also
reckoned Bunnie's skeletal system would be completely synthetic,
given the loads she's placed on it.

What I would really like to know though is would she like a nice
cool glass of 30 weight. >:)

It's a pity no one wants to risk the N.American market with a more

The process is described somewhat in Dan Drazen's fanfic "Bloodlines", 
which can be found on Bookshire's homepage.  The story's long, but it's a

I agree that some of the Sonic fanfic isn't very good, but much of 
it's excellent!  "Bloodlines", "The Temporal Syndrome", and "Capture the 
Flag" are three of my favorites, but there are many others.  Bottom line: 
don't let one bad story turn you off to sonic fanfic.  Give it a chance!

400???  Gak!  I can't even keep up with Sonic, Star Trek, and Disney comics 
at 15-30 pages each - I can't imagine a comic/story/characters good enough 
that I'd go for 400 pages/month (but if I had to ride a subway 1 hour each 
way to work and back like most Japanese, that would be different :^))

Done.  I put both of our names on the Reply-To: header.
BTW, I fixed a couple typos and tinkered with the margins a bit -
hope that's OK...

Too true, unfortunately, though I haven't seen fan-fic flamed there.

Holy Macaroni! 

I step away from my account for 5 days and I get 150 messages on this list.
I don't want to shut off the info about 'Twisted-Mettle' however I think 
alot of the discussion here can be shuffled off to private e-mail.

Perhaps occasional (weekly?) updates and lists of 'submitted suggestions' 
might be useful and more tolarable for those not actively involved with 
this game.

Back to the topic I was going to talk about...

I noticed that Snively's feelings tward Robotnik seemed to have changed
a bit from the 1st season to the 2nd.  In the first season I felt that 
Snively shared Robotnik's 'vision' although he fearful of his uncle's
rage.  In the 2nd season, Snively was considerably more 'defiant' to
Robotnik's rule (e.g. muttering insults) and was just going along with
him partially out of fear but also because he knew he could take over 
if/when Robotnik made a fatal mistake.  We were never quite sure how 
different Snively's 'vision' was from Robotnik's.

[I also heard the TV show 'Deadly Games' has been cancelled too... 
 Bummer... I liked that one]

If I remember correctly, the wedding was part of a play they were 
putting on.  Robotnik confused it with a real one.  I have Sonic #18
(as well as all the other Archie Sonic comics) so I can look it up
to make sure.

Arg... still quite a few mailings to go thorugh.

When I said that, I meant agewise. I heard it mentioned someplace, but I
don't recall where. Maybe it was said in "Blast To The Past", maybe it was
stated that Sonic's age was fifteen, when Sally's was sixteen, I don't
remember. But I do believe that Sally is about two to three month older than
Sonic.

I believe that the process has been described in a couple of stories (one
of them is "Nanowars") as Nanites. It was stated that Nanites, microscopic 
robots built litterally molecule by molecule, ocupy the beam that comes down
un the subject, and infect the body. After that, they gradually replace every
cell by a synthetic one, thus avoiding the need for DNA scan (replace each
cell
with it's synthetic simily? think about it). After the process is complete
(and
it doesn't take too long), the beam is cut off, and the nanites are rejected
by
body as foreighn material. (As stated in Bloodlines, the body is not
completely
metalic. Also, the synthetic parts seem to be undetected by the body <look at
Bunny, her body isn't rejecting her arm?> )

Here's my two cents on the topic:

I think the matter-energy-matter thing is right, but I don't think the 
replacement is by part-its by cell.  The cells could be replaced with 
small, mechanical versions of their biological counterparts, performing 
the same operations, but, obviously, with much greater resiliance to the 
elements and use.

How do they stay together?  Very high magnetic fields around each cell 
hold them all together in their proper order and configuration, allowing 
those incredible feats of strength by our roboticized friends.

Deroboticization--if the entire creature is roboticizted, there would be 
no original DNA (I think), so the cells (the mechanical ones) store the 
DNA info and all the other stuff for a deroboticizer to put back together.

Now that I've explained it, who has the free time to build one for me?  
If you do, I'll let you be the first "guniea pig"!  8^)

Sorry.  I would have liked to send the above reply directly to one person, 
but couldn't find his e-mail address.  I don't remember the person's name, but
this message is a response to their recent post saying that they only read one
Sonic fanfic, didn't like it, and then didn't read any more Sonic 
fanfics.  Whoever you are, I hope you get my message and change your mind.

See above .sig for my name.

She got them in Minoc Grove.  Nothing else is mentioned about it because of

that Sally can now juice.  The MechTail series are an example...

Ahh yes, the glories of writing your own stories about our favorite blue
wonder..... new friends arrive, old friends go....and, though the wonder and
simplicity of writing a story comes the trouble....it's not all as simple as
it seems.  Back in my AOL and Fraudigy days, there were many talented
writers on both nets that liked to expand the stories and even update Sega's
views on how Mobius should run.  But, as I fly through the stories, numerous
conflicts between them arise.  One simple conflict would be (I won't go into
specifics, and this is NOT an attack for those that cannot determine that,)
in one story I read Uncle Chuck is alive, well, and "de-robotisized", and it
another, (the one I prefer, because as of now, I don't think their is (or
should be) a way to de-robotisize people,) he is still under Robotnick's
controll, and a full robot.  This brings two problems: 1) Is any one right?
That is, which story flies?  And 2) Can there/should there be different
stories going?  Well, I've decided we need to have stories meet, and
(through a SINGLE story I'm working on, very long,) I may be able to do it.
Which brings me to my SECOND question/comment: the process of robotisizing
itself: in stories, it is my OPPINION, (not an attack, I'm sick of getting
into debates because people think I'm attacking other people,) that we NEED
to keep the robotisization in the stories.  I have reasons to back this.
They are:
1) Ever watch an old cartoon and the bad guys ALWAYS seem to escape?
There's a reason for that.  It's so the cartoon continues next week. :)
Same applies here.  If we figure out how do de-robotisize people, Robotnik's
lost.  That's the end of the stories.  Think of it: even if Robotnik is
still in power, all the freedom fighters have to do is un-robotisize the
others, and it doesn't matter HOW powerful Robotnik is, we'd still win by a
sheer onslaught of force.  Well, anyone agree/disagree with this?  Let's get
some posting on this to see what people have to say.  BTW-I don't write
stories much, and this one I'm working on is VERY long, I just hope it's
good.  :)  (IF it is, it'll answer LOSTSA questions, and throw things back
in line, story wise..)

Later all....off to the hardships of school!

Ah, Doug, you've touched a nerve of mine...

Since I began compiling the FAQ file, I've found that there is one
aspect of the stories that only the absolute devotee addresses: the
canonicity of the stories.  This is behind the near-universal rejection
of the "Adentures of Sonic the Hedgehog" cartoons when it comes to
having anything to say about Mobius.  The weekend cartoons, OTOH,
achieved almost overnight canonicity.  Since the Archie comics are in
the process of tracking the SatAM toon Mobius more seriously, they, too,
are edging toward being taken seriously as part of the canon.

I can't expound on this at length here but you'll find that the fanfic
community can be pretty lenient about alternative Sonic stories so long
as the essential characters are still themselves.  I kind of liken it to
the body of tales of some saint or other being made manifest in some
French backwater village.  It'll work for the faithful unless it's
obviously heretical in content. [Sorry; when you're a theology major you
end up talking this way ;-) ].

Careful, that's what DC tried with "Crisis on Infinite Earths" and IMVNSHO 
made things worse - shortly after that I dropped all their titles except 
Star Trek, and now even that's coming to an end...

Good point; I liked how the Sat. AM series did it: they gave Uncle Chuck 
his mind back, and showed that the derobotization process was feasible, but 
didn't quite get there, thus had something to continue to strive for.  But
that still doesn't justify the abrupt end to the series :^( (but that's a 
separate thread :^))

The only one I've read so far is "Other Sonics", which is kind of the wrong 
example since it's deliberately set in an alternate Sonic universe.  But I 
agree that as long as the characters are themselves, and any additional ones 
don't get in the way of that, then I have no real problem with it.  
Examples:  I like the presence of Bookshire (though he seems somewhat 
superfluous with Rotor around), but I have problems with Packwood - one, 
his sheer evil tends to really make the stories he's in rather grim, and 
two, I find it hard to believe Robotnik would create something that even 
had the possibility of overthrowing him... (nothing personal against the 
creator(s) of these characters, BTW :^))

Subject: Fanfic, and other things.....

Ive just read mightys mail about fanfic.....

And must say i disagree with him on it.  It is good to have diffrent 
ideas of how mobius might progress, each a parrallel universe to 
another.  This allows everyone to have a vision of what they think 
happens, and allows us, to read each story for its own worth, and to 
consider it on its own merits.  I mean the BAM storyline, i realy like 
it, but some of what happens contradicts other storys... So what, its 
still a good story, i like to feel that it is set in a parrallel to the 
other story, thus the problem of contridictions is solved.

Also about the robotisizer,  also a good idea in my point of view...BUT 
remeber Robotniks Forces have main robotisizers, these i have been lead 
to belive can do many at once, where as the FF only have a one at a time 
BLUE robotisizer, this means that they now have a weapon to use agenst 
robotnik, but robotnik still has an edge so to speak. For every one the 
FF derobotisise, Robuttnik can do many, possible hundreds.


Well tare this to pices if you want, it may make an intresting discussion.

Hey, Don't sweat it, Mr. Castigia.  I just hope that my submission has 
made it to the appointed address . . . 

But on the lighter note, I'm wondering what's going on with the other 
Archie Comics.  I hear that you're getting rid of TMNT, correct me if I'm 
wrong. (I did see Splinter as a human, *that* would be a sign.)  I know

Thanks for siding with me... Now, I know its getting kinda bothersome to
some about seeing alot of new characters coming up, but then again, how
could some even be made that were good without these new characters? For
example, How would David Prower exist, if it wasnt for Bookshire and rotor
creating him? Without Bookshire there, who is an added character, I
seriously doubt David would have been made. And how could we ever forget
Packbell?  That, in my opinion, is a good added character.  Gives Robotniks
side an edge not found in the TV show.  I'm not saying its wrong to have
new characters, but I also belive that if one is created, it should be
developed well... I'm working my butt off trying to develop Kain more, and
trying to get a good second story idea made... Just takes time.  I don't
like to rush story ideas just to slap them on Bookshires WWW page. I try to
make something WORTH reading.  I'm still new to writing stories, so thats
another thing slowing me down.  I've enjoyed almost every Sonic story on
that site; with or without the new characters.  Im my opinion, if you think
you can make a new charcter to put in a story, whith a purpose, and
well-developed, I say go for it.

Truth be, no single story is ever really "right" or "wrong", but simply a 
matter of how the writer views the characters. That being said, there's 
also different versions of what is "canon" in the StH universe, coming 
from Sega, two versions from DiC, and the ever-evolving Archie comics, as 
well as a sort of "shared universe" here on the Internet with certain 
original characters created by fan writers that get used by others, such 
as Bookshire and Packbell.

I never said it wasn't.  The one problem with E-mail (besides it being used
to corrupt the people), is that you can't understand my tone when I make a
comment.  I personally LIKE BAM quite a lot!  Especially the deluxe
version-such dedication over something that COULD HAVE BEEN trivial is what
made it great.  Hats off to the author of BAM, (whom which I personally
spoke with,) for he is truly a fine storywriter!  As point of fact, (to
quote Levine), it is unwise to assume how I feel about a thing (ie the
story) when I only commented about the Sonic writing process as a whole.
Please try to refrain from such in the future! :)

This is very correct.  In such, (hypothetically speaking,) we are fighting a
futile war. The only thing that keeps it going is our ambition (as freedom
fighters,) which perhaps will not last.  I say this for two reasons,
(bringing up new points,) first off, Robotnik may inevidably win.  SECONDLY,
and most importantly, what will be of the next generation?  I see singles,
(at most doubles), of different species.  Are they going to interbreed?  As
point in fact, how would a half-squirrel half-hedgehog look for a kid?
(Sally and Sonic in contrast, of course..) it, would most likely, not work. =
=20


....and more generally, (do not flame me for this-this is on-topic in my
oppinion,)

What is it to become "obsessed" with what once a video game?  I'm not
blaming anyone-I am myself.  And I'm not inviting flames, such as, "well, if
you don't like it, leave!"...I'm asking, rather simply....my friends suspect
me as being "messed-up" for such obsession, (which I probably am...) but I
have been into Sonic when Sonic the Hedgehog was released on the old
system....I'm what you'd call a "classic fan"... we all are... (I would
think..) what what makes us this?  What obsession?  I don't want it to lead
somewhere bad, and as much as I hate conformity, do any of you think this
obsession with a make-beleive world is normal?  Please answer in a truthful
and non-sarcastic tone.  If you have to flame me, don't.  It will waste
"precious bandwith" (I love that line) and will make me sad.

Hey people! (guys didn't seem to work)
    My time on AOL has expired, and I don't want to pay extra. But, the good
news is, I found a BBS that gave me free E-Mail acces. Now I just have to
wait untill MAJODOMO answers. See you when I see you (whenever that will be
<hopefully soon>).

Now to Sonic business:
     I see that some people didn't read all the stories. That's OK. I didn't
either. But I do suggest that the first ones (or next ones, if you didn't
read them) would be either "Bloodlines" or "Capture the Flag". Both tell
quite a bit about history of Sonic/Sally, and both are written with a
book-like(?) style.


Have a nice post! :') / :'(

In the spirit of fools rushing in where angels fear to tred:

Ever since the conclusion of "Sally's Crusade" (In Your Face #1), the
convention seems to be that in an interspecies marriage, the species
would remain intact, possibly linked to gender [c.f. the image of a
pint-sized Sonic and Sally tearing around the castle].  I'll admit that
I thought the "flashforward" of the story sort of bogus on first read,
but it seems to have settled into the canon.

Will Rogers once observed: "Everybody's ignorant, only in different
subjects."  IMHO, it's the same with obsession.  Those of us on this
list have an obsession for the blue blur (or one of the costars of the
show), but it's not like we invented the condition.  There are some
model railroad enthusiasts, or Star Trek devotees, or Notre Dame
football fans who make us look absolutely sane by comparison.  Any onus
we might experience is probably more due to the fact that our interest
is in a cartoon character rather than something "normal."  But, hey, if
it works for you, then maybe the question of "normal" is secondary.  At
least, that's what my analyst says ;-) .

>What obsession?  

I don't think it's an obsession at all. I view it as something which is of
interest to all of us. I know lots of guys who no longer enjoy cartoons of
any kind (they also say they never did...yeah, right.) I say they're missing
out. C'mon, how can you not enjoy some of the classic shorts showing Goofy
flying through plate glass windows, or the Wile E. Coyote, who is the
stupidest genius in the world, being blown to smithereens every 10 seconds?

>I don't want it to lead
>somewhere bad, and as much as I hate conformity, do any of you think this
>obsession with a make-beleive world is normal?  

I think that saying something is "normal" or "abnormal" is making a
statement which is much too general, and it doesn't allow for any kind of
gray area in between. To use my above comparison, some people would say it's
"abnormal" for me to watch cartoons, or to write stories involving cartoon
characters, or make doodles of cartoon characters. So what? Let's take a
look at who's actually creating them! They're adults, and they're not
considered "abnormal" by any people that I know. (I guess that if what you
do makes you money, it's okay. We just can't enjoy things without promise of
monetary gain.) You said it yourself Mighty, and it just doesn't get any
more obvious than this.-> If everybody were a conformist, the world would be
a very, very dull place.

I know....it's odd, however, how one sometimes needs another to get by on a
point.  I myself have never beleived in confority or the "system" or
anything else.... call me a Romantic if you will, but it's just not my style
to conform.  However, when you're alone on something in this crazy world, it
makes it harder to accept as being "normal", (even though there's really no
basis for comparison...) however, even if you're wrong, or "different", so
to speak, as long as there's someone "different" with you... hey, missery
loves company.  Most of the time I can stand for what I beleive in, but
sometimes, every so often, I have to take a step back and say "whoa"....and
I'm glad I did.  Watching Sonic the Hedgehog or any other cartoon is just
what you like...which you should be allowed to do.  The one GOOD point
America has, (probably the ONLY, no offense to any non-Americans,) is that
"wretched" freedom of speach.  :)  But even if they handicapped you and took
your speech, they cannot controll your thoughts-ever.  (Or at least I HOPE
TO GOD not....this world would be in terrible shape otherwise!)

Well, blah blah blah... to finally connect this all to the "list", I'm just
glad there's other Sonic "freaks" out there, that way I don't feel so bad
about being one myself. :)

BTW-An inside source gives me info to the voice of Sally on STH sat.
morn.... if you were me, would you call and bother or leave alone and
wonder...?  I'm afraid to call, because... well, you know...people get sad
when they get calls from people they don't know... <yawn> ...oh well...I'm
off to bed.  Later all!

<Shrugs> I dunno, it just came with the Prodigy Mail Manager.  Anywayz, to
keep from being electronically eviscerated (YEOWCH!  I HATE WHEN PEOPLE DO
THAT TO ME!) by Rat, I'll post something Sonicy in this message.

I sent The Hunt Begins to Book, and, as I saw this morning, it's not up on
his page yet.  Good, no rush; I want him to read it and say how much he
likes it instead of not getting around to reading it and saying
"Description forthcoming" like he did with my last two stories (which
wouldn't be so bad if he'd done it with anyone ELSE'S stories, but since
it's only mine, it's like saying "This story ain't worth reading unless
you're one of those Sonic '96 members Thad sent to this page, cuz it's in
YOUR universe, and it's partially your fault that this story ain't worth
reading unless you're one of those Sonic '96 members Thad sent to this
page, cuz it's in YOUR universe, and it's partially your fault that..." and
so on and so forth).  Ah well, it's okay; the other two I just kinda did
for fun; this one I spent a LOT of time on (over a year in planning) and
it's MUCH more representative for my ability as an author.



><

Sorry, Rat; I WOULD'VE put that first part in an entirely different
message, but the PMM, while it has good quotes, does NOT have a very good
method of replying to anyone on the mailing list, and I don't have a pen
and paper and am too lazy to get them.

	I need to know something. Where is David Piston? and did anyone else 
recieve my RPG? Is anyone listening to me? Here's something about Sonic 
characters.....would anyone like thier stats? But, really, I think that if every 
character has 'super powers' of some sort, it would ruin the game and the comic, 
and the TV show, and...well, you get the idea. Is there anyone who agrees with 
me.
	(I thought about this when someone mentioned Sally with super speed) [I 
dead the thought!]
	So I guess I should end this letter,

Well, I have a feeling I'm about to be kicked off the list for this.  If
this is the case, so be it; if the ML keeps going in the direction it's
headed it won't be worth having by this time next month anyway.  8'(

Okay, here's what I'VE been wondering: WHAT ARE YOU ANTI-TWISTED METTLE
PEOPLE ON?!?!?!?!  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING IF YOU THINK IT'S OFF-TOPIC!
"...You can post...anything related to the Sonic/Mobius storyline..."  DOES
THAT RING A BELL?!  Twisted Mettle is a game based ENTIRELY on the Sat-AM
(Sun-AM now, eh?) cartoon, with Snively, Sally, Dulcy, the WORKS, and if
you think THAT'S not related to the Sonic/Mobius storyline, you clearly
haven't seen ANY of the cartoons, or read ANY of the comics or fanfic, and
therefore HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THE WRONG LIST!  As for the "large amount of
mail" you're whining about, there was an EQUAL amount when the perv
directory (a MUCH less worthy asset) was removed, and no-one complained.
Besides, if you think this is too much mail (oh boy, here comes the "I
walked 20 miles in the snow, uphill both ways" line), try THIS: Write a
message to EINEXILE@NETCOM.COM with the message "SUBSCRIBE EBLANA" as the
subject, wait a week, and then download all the mail, which *I* did without
complaining ONCE!

Okay, I'm happier now that I've finally gotten all my 600+ Eblana messages
out of my "incoming folder" and gotten that off my chest.  If the
consequence is that I'm going to be kicked off the list, like I said, so be
it.  I came here to share my stories, which I can't send to the list
anymore, and to discuss fan works for Sonic the Hedgehog, and if Twisted
Mettle isn't one, may God strike me down and kick me in the nads afterwards!!!!!



><

If you don't see me on the list anymore, I urge you to follow my lead and
unsubscribe yourselves.  Then, we can start the Twisted Mettle list, and
see how the mail there compares to the sound of crickets chirping over on
this one.  However, if I stay, maybe these maint people AREN'T complete
fools, and there's hope.  Depends...

Uh, NyQuil.  How about you? :)

Well, yes, to me it does.  This mailing list was created to talk about the
story-lines that detail the Sonic universes.  It was my understanding that
this includes the plot lines of the Saturday morning show, the comics,
the fan-fic, the weekday afternoon show (if anybody dares :) ), even the
PLOTs of the Genesis and Game Gear games... but not the game play itself.

This, again to my understanding, does NOT include a bunch of messages that
ask for support on the creation of a game, and a whole bunch of other
messages detailing what will go into such a game.  If you want to talk about
the story/plot that surrounds this game, and provided the traffic for such
doesn't get too out of hand (I've heard that some netters actually have to
pay for their incoming email), then fine.  But game play suggestions, coding,
graphics... uh, no, don't think so.

 Here's hoping the game gets it's own list anyways.  Those who want it
definitely seem to be that gung-ho about it (yourself included), so a
mailing list for that would be a good idea.

Or maybe you can talk about such things on the alt.fan.sonic newsgroup.
Such things would be more in-topic there (since, again to my understanding,
the idea is to talk about ALL things Sonic over there), not to mention it
might increase the traffic of an otherwise slim-pickings newsgroup.

	It's not that we don't like the info on the game, but discussions on the 
tech. aspect of it drive us crazy! If they talked about the characters (the ture 
purpose of this list) then mabye it would be alright. But no, they didn't often 
enough and some of us started to get ticked off as we recieved twelve somewhat 
messages about the game that really had no true purpose. 
	I have told readers to send replies to me about my RPG and even though 
they sent some here (I think, never really paid attention) they kept it short. 
(unlike the PC game guys) 
	So now that you have heard my side, I'll be quite. (I even had the 
curtisy to E-mail ratman and ask him if the message was related to my game) So, 
I guess I need to end now,

Well, thanks to a bit of time allocation, I have finished the second RL10

mistakes/errors.. repack the sentences and post it to Ratman 'n Bookshire.

(C)(TM)(R) will now be allocated more time, and hopefully this will mean I
can finish it. Don't worry--still working on the game all.=20

The game is not. The POSTS ARE OFF TOPIC. Have you actually read any of those
posts? All they talk about are the technical specifics of the game and how
awesome the programmers think they are. They never go into character
development, storyline, or really anything to do with Sonic. 

If you don't agree, you have the option of leaving.
I DO NOT appreciate you sending a flame to the mailing list.
If you want to do it again, please just unsubscribe.

Do not reply to the list with this please.

A few people complained. But it got a lot of people worried that the site I
have about Sonic stuff would be history.

When people post about what sound system a game has and all the technical
aspects like that, it's definatly off topic. If someone wanted to talk about
the storyline of the game, that would be fine.

Ok, i have removed you. This is _NOT_ cool. I have offered twice to start 
a twisted mettle list, which Mighty has said no to. But trying to get 
people to unsubscribe from this list is just crossing the line.
I'll unsubscribe you right after this message goes out.

On this note, I agree with you. I suppose that one of the reasons I enjoy
the stories is because the general themes seem plausible. The idea of small
groups of rebels fighting against a gargantuan source of power has been the
focus of many authors over the years. (Look at the Star Wars trilogy.)  Hey,
it works. But to grant the characters some types of special abilities would
really detract from the original intent of the characters' creators, making
them seem removed from reality. Meaning, we really couldn't relate to their
hopes and aspirations any longer. It might be funny if somebody wrote a
parody where all the FF were super-powered idiots. It has been done before,
turning heroes who are intelligent into idiots with all muscle and no
mentality. But to make them this way permanently would do a great
disservice, IMHO. Just my thoughts.....

Giving characters superpowers could work if they are balanced by
superweaknesses.  An ultra-power weapon could be balanced by its lack of
accuracy in hitting the target.  That can make for a friendly-fire subplot
which, while saddening, would show how another character deals with loss. 
A character with super-strength could be balanced by undergoing an
"equal-but-opposite reaction" making him/her/it weak and vulnerable after
using their strength.  And Antoine can balance out any Freedom Fighter
team which (in the mind of the story author) is a bit too successful. 

But giving the Freedom Fighters infinite power would make the story less 
believable if not even create sympathy for Robo 'n' Sniv.  Not much will 
kill my interest in a story faster than a lack of believability.

It's possible. After all, she doesn't have a bushy tail. Mobian genetics
seems to be very interesting topic.

I wouldn't call, but I _would_ send her a letter expressing my admiration 
for all the cute/sexy furries she's done: Morgana Macabre, Fifi LaFume, and 
Sally Acorn.  I find it somewhat odd that we haven't seen much written 
about her, but a fair amount about Tress MacNeille (not that Tress didn't 
deserve all of it but still...)

I'm actually torn between whose voice I like better; Tress has a wider 
range (IMHO), but Kath does sexy voices better...

I disagree.  Remember what happened to Yugoslavia (sp?) after breaking away
from the USSR?  That what could happen to Mobius, although not in such a
drastic manner.  Even if Davey Crockett *does* manage to deroboticize
everyone on Mobius, which he probably *could* not do, and single-handedly
take out his dad and end Robotnik's reign of tyrrany once and for all, which
he *might* do, but that is *very* uncertain, the story of Mobius does not
*certainly* end there.  There *is* a life after Robotnik, and the
possibilities abounding there could be endless, or maybe even better than
what's happening now . . . 

But then again, the story *would* end.  The Evil has been kicked off the
planet, permanently, Peace and Prosperity will be restored on Mobius, and
everyone, save a few bitter souls scarred too harshly by the war, will live
happily ever after, up to the point where Davey Crockett "dies of old age"
and returns to his home planet by the same mysteries of the Void that brought
him there . . . just eight hours after he left . . . which *did* happen.  But
ain't that one of the most important pieces of a good saga?  A solid
conclusion, or even a happy one?

Yup.. I got it... I was half-way through writing a letter asking a few 
questions about it (e.g. how certain things work) when I realized what
was going on after a few more reads.

I've actually reformatted a good portion of the rules with MS Word so that 
they look a bit better and are easier to read.  I was going to ask if you
or anyone else were interested in that MS-Word file.

> Here's something about Sonic characters.....would anyone like thier stats? 

That might make some good examples to include with the instruction..
to show what 'well-rounded' characters might look like

Yup.  You'd no-longer have Sonic.  You'd have short-n-furry X-men clones.
Also, in an RPG setting you'd probaly ond up creating 'Dumper Force!' 
(My generic term for where you have a bunch of bad 'powergaming' 
roleplayers involved in stupid plots).

> (I thought about this when someone mentioned Sally with super speed)

dead or dread?  ... err.. anyway

Sally DID get super speed in the last SAT-AM episode.  The guy who wrote 
the Blood and Metal series [Arrg.. I forget his name offhand... Gonterman?]
figured this effect was permanant (I'd probably have made it temporary
if I wrote stories) [actually, I finally DO have a few Sonic story ideas...]

Matt Penna,
> Did it occur to any of you that we may never know Princess Sally's
> real species?

..ohhh, this is potential flame-war material. :)

I've covered this before (see the list-archive for my message from
July 5th), and IMO the only consistent answer to Princess Sally's
species is Weasel.  There's the thin body, the brown pelt, the shape
of her head, etc, etc, et al., et al..  In Sonic #26, one of the
Arctic Mobians is Erma [the Ermine], and sans the white front (as
all European stoats have), she and Sally are identical in appearance.
Draz should mention this in the FAQ. :)

What evidence is there for the claim Sally is a [ground] squirrel or
chipmunk, eh?  The colour of the pelt and its markings aren't even
there..  (Well, at least that extremely contrived idea that Sally is
a Fox who fell for that foolish adolescent fad of having her tail
bobbed appears to have been forgotten..  Self-mutilation, ick.)

Matt,
 > Personally, I think she was adopted. I think she's
 > a cross between a squirrel and a chipmunk. What do you think?
Doug,
 > Maybe a hybrid fox?

There isn't any evidence in the Mobian universe for the existence
of cross-breeds..  A theory proposed in the very early days of the
mailing list is the character's species is determined by the
appropriate parent, that is, Sally's Mum was a Weasel too.
(Whatever happened to the Queen anyway?)

	Good idea, next thing for those who asked for the RPG...sample 
character! (I'll use....Fenrir, a character from my story [still in works])

	One thing, if anyone wants specific person stats for characters, ask me. 
(use my address) 
	
	And last, Snivley, would he be a better Robotnik???

I just got stimied (inside joke, but..) shouldn't/wouldn't Paul know if
Sally was a fox or a squirel or whatever?  Just curious....

BTW-the page has been updated:

PS-my girlfriend, Vixie (bunnie1235@aol.com) is now on the list.  She's

This is a question that's keeping me up at nights.

What does the Death Egg look like, I haven't seen too many of the "real"
episodes, and the "ahum" episode isn't watchable anyway.
(Would Mr Video Blaster please consider ULing some pics to Rat.org?)

PLEAAAASE?

My, what a short message.

Agreed on both counts...

I wish I have had for some time has been to meet both Tress and Kath at 
the same time, in a public place, and express to them my thanks for the 
wonderful voices that have given great fantasies to (grin!)... (Kath also 
did Li'l Sneezer and the "cute" bunny before Buster's cxreation in "The 
Looney Beginning"...) Make it a trio by adding Cristine Cavanaugh (Bunnie 
Rabbot) and I'll be more than satisfied... :)

(And yes, I do know the difference between the real voicers and their 
characters... :) )

I was thinking the same thing... SOMEONE has to know what Sally is.  Stupid
question time: Who created Sally, or does anyone know?

    It doesn't look like anything.  the Death Egg is a part of the
Sonic Vidogames (notably Sonic 2 and 3), not the show.  The Doomsday
machine bears a slight resemblance to the Death Egg, but isn't the same
thing really...

So is her Dad's, and he was a Fox!

(And my surname before my parent's divorce was Rose! (No, I'm not
related to any pink Hedgehogs.) Do Amy or I look like, uh, things
which eats roses to you?)

That was mentioned back in July too.  Why do people have a problem
with Weasel??  It's only in a few Disney and Warner Brothers cartoons
have I ever seen them portrayed in anything like a lower caste..

(It's also nice to think of Sally and Bunnie friendship is
irregardless of their species-- if one good thing came out of
the War, its abolised ancient prejudices once and for all..)

My opinion of Archie is they're publishing the almost-mythical
story of the War about a thousand years after the event, and a
lot of details were confused when the story was passed down to
each generation after the next.. (For an example, when they
started they thought Sally was /pink/!  It was only after that
their rent-a-scholars realised the error..)

I remember them explaining this a while back. (Sally actually started out as
kind of orange and yellow, then turned pink, then became the standard shades
of brown we recognize now.) I think there was a note from the creators of
the book on one of the early letters pages, explaining why Sally's
appearance had changed. They said that there was very little information on
how the Freedom Fighters would actually look as a finished product, so they
were doing the best they could with the information that they had. (This was
before the cartoon started, remember.) So, when the cartoon started they
wanted to try to be consistent with it, and changed the appearance. If you
remember, Rotor's name used to be Boomer in the early issues of the book, as
well. I don't think we should judge them too harshly, as it sounds like they
were flying by the seats of their pants.   

-Matt

I WISH!!! and let it be on a major network so I can get it here in 
Canada too :)  I think the exec's who cancelled Sonic made a very stupid 
mistake...We can only hope they learned something from it and it doesn't 
happen again...however I've heard rumours that the persons behind ABC SAT

is keep out fingers crossed...maybe those of us who wrote in to DIC 
didn't waste a stamp after all.  <shrug>

Oh no... not this again :-)

Anyway... There are multiple refs (from Archie and possibly Sega) stating
that she's a squirrel (ground squirrel to be exact).  I've decided to 
accpet this.

But how do you explain the lack of tail?

  Well... Some species of ground squirrels have short tails.
    OR
  It could be a 'royalty' thing to have the tail clipped at a young age. 
  Much the same way certain species of dogs get their tails clipped often
  (e.g. sheepdogs ... dobermans (sp?) )

  That would explain her father not having a tail either (and possibly why
  Antoine doesn't have a tail... we're not entirely sure what his origins
  are... he could be associated with the royal family somehow... an 
  association which would require his tail be 'clipped'.  Isn't he 
  "Captain of the Guard" or at least trying to be or something?

  I had considered a third possiblity (she could've lost it earlier due to
  a close scrape with Robotnik's forces) however when I saw that she had
  a short tail as a young girl in that 'Blast from the Past' episode I 
  dismissed this possibility.... That's too bad... this might've been an
  interesting story to write.

But what about her father being a fox?

  In real life... mixing two species is generally a bozo-nono and will
  either result in nothing, or if you're lucky... a sterile cross-breed 
    (e.g. Horse + Donkey = Mule... I THINK this is how it works)

  In cartoons, you're often given a little leeway here.  I wrote up 
  something about 'cartoon genetics' a while back trying to explain
  all of this.  It was long and complicated but generally said
  when an inter-species couple has children there are generally three
  possibilities .. depending on the cartoon series:
 
   (1) The children inherit the species of the parent with the same sex. 
       (e.g. A male fox and a female squirrel would bear fox boys and 
             squirrel girls.)
   (2) The children are a 'blend' of the two species.   
   (3) The children are one species or the other.

  In the 'Sonic' universe, the first seems to be the rule although we can't
  rule out the third possibility.

  I don't think she's a 'blend' because she looks quite different than any
  of the other foxes on the show or in the comics.
   
  The conclusion of all this is that Sally's  mother is a squirrel.  There 
  was a fanfic story which had Sally's mother in it (as a squirrel) so 
  someone out there belives this (or something like this) :-)

Anyway... I hope this helps :-)

To round things out (while getting off-topic):

Kath Soucie also does double-voicing as the twins Phil and Lil on
Nickelodeon's "Rugrats" [where, BTW, Christine Cavanaugh is the voice of
Chuckie].  Kath has also done some voice work for Disney: she's done two
Aladdin eps that I know of: she was the title role in "The Entity" and
she voiced a poor girl on the classic Aladdin ep "Do The Rat Thing"
where she spoke that timeless line: "It's the Magic Holiday Rat!  She
brought us a present from the Rodent King!"

You had to be there...

Heya all,=20

I was just watching the introduction to the Sonic cartoon. (I runs every
time I start windoze as I have it in AVI and have put it in my startup..
though it was taken from the S.A. version and has no voice.. just the
music.. of course it is better rather than a Zulu singer doing the intro.
"Mshe u bitsa gona, uSonic e Phemekela!")=20

Anyways, I was wondering. In the intro we see Sonic speeding through the
forest, outrunning Robotniks ships to tell Uncle Chuck and some unknown
furry to look up at the big ugly coming over the palace.

Now here's what I was wondering, since Robotnik took over when Sonic was
about five, how come we see a teenage Sonic running through the forest. And,
what's more.. when we see inside the ship where Robotnik is stroking his
robo-parrot .. how come his arm is robotocized? (His left arm was
robotocized when he fell into an open robotocizer, when Sonic went to rescue
his avational fox pal.. and that was *after* the invasion.)

Is the intro a set of clips from multiple shows or something?

Cheers

from the beginning from when Uncle Chuck FIRST looses his chili stand to

like a small comic in the beginning, (BEFORE the days of Archie), and has a
pretty interesting story line...I think I'll scan it and put it on Rat's

The reason I don't mention the weasel theory in the FAQ file question is
that it is absurd!  For a number of reasons:

1) The comics, for better or worse, are consistent in labeling Sally as
a "squirrel," more likely a ground squirrel.  One of the reasons the
debate has flared up from time to time is that readers are unwilling to
take the description at face value and indulge in wishful thinking.
There's no point in holding to the canonicity of certain sources if
you're not going to take them at face value on subjects that cut across
your own preferences.

2) I would be the LAST person to cite artwork by Manak (especially of
subsidiary characters and guest stars) as keys to character
identification.  In my summary of the story in Sonic #26 I cite all the
features where Manak went wrong, just as he ended up drawing Barby Koala
in the Tails miniseries looking more like a sexy lab rat than a true
koala!

3) Finally, consider Sonic himself!  Hedgehogs are not royal blue, nor
do they only have one ridge of quills running down the back.  I know
this is being too picky, but everybody seems content to accept the
identification of Sonic as a hedgehog at face value.

Apparently you've never seen either "Sally's Crusade" from the In Your
Face special #1, or "The Return" in Sonic #22.  Each of those stories
posits a future wherein Sonic & Sally have tied the knot and have
offspring of their own: in each story, the children are the same gender
and species as a parent [i.e., a little boy hedgehog and a little girl
squirrel].  So like it or not, there's your "evidence."

Her fate has never been determined canonically, nor her origins.  I
expressed my own theory in my fanfic story, "Bloodlines."  Note: it
isn't pretty....

Ok, got a Sonic AVI file finally.

It's the intro that was previously talked about. It's pretty neat actually.

If I could get my hands on an AVI editor, I could splice the theme song from
/pub/sonic/sounds/sonic-theme-stereo.zip to make a version with lyrics and
good quality sound.

http://rat.org/pub/sonic/movies/sonintro.zip
or FTP to the same place.

Windows 95: use Media Player. It comes with Windows 95.

Windows 3.1: get vfw in /pub/msdos

Macintosh: get vfw for Mac in /pub/mac/utils

If you have any questions, write me directly and not to the list.

I've always thought of the intro as something not to be taken literally, 
but rather as a presentation of the show's main plot (Robotnik takes over 
Mobius and wrecks the place, the freedom fighters fight back).  And, of 
course, the audience would probably be more used to seeing the teenage 
Sonic than the 5-year-old Sonic.

Actually, according to "Blast to the Past- Part 2", Robotnik's arm was 
roboticized when he fell into the roboticizer beam when the teenage Sonic 
and Sally arrived to rescue Robotnik's prisoners (including their 
5-year-old selfs) from the roboticizer.  I don't think Tails was there.

 Some, like the 'Sally-species' issue, everyone would beg to differ on this.
I mean, look at Blood and Metal. How did Robotnik get here in the first
place? Was he _ever_ normal?(To human standards) I mean, he was War
Minister...his arm was probably lost in battle! (That's what *I* think...)
The 'Big-Round Guy' was probably a fluke of the beta-robotizier. Snively? I
dunno, I have a theory on him...but that's another post.

I can make AVI files, up to 44000khz or whatever it is in 16-bit stereo,
but I need an avi editor that lets me compress the stuff. I can record it
uncompressed, but gawd. TOO HUGE to leave uncompressed. :P If anoyne knows
of some good AVI editors, lemme know. I could make alotta AVI files. (Tried
to make one of a scene from the Dulcy episode for a friend in Germany, but
uncompressed it was 40 megs! and it was only 30 seconds long)

I just assumed that, since the original post asked about the intro to the 
Saturday AM show, that the poster was referring to the Sat. AM 
continuity.  And, in that continuity, "Blast to the Past" clearly showed 
Robotnik's arm being roboticized as I described above.  (When Sonic and 
Sally tried to rescue their 5-year-old selfs.)

I have already tried this, however due to slight differences in the
frequencies of timer cystals, the music goes out of phase with the sound
effects. IE we hear the beeping of the timer count down at the wrong time.

I don't know if anyone remembers but a while ago I posted an entire
filmography for the verryous voice actors in sonic. I guess I should
post it to the FTP site.

-> Kath Soucie also does double-voicing as the twins Phil and Lil on
-> Nickelodeon's "Rugrats" [where, BTW, Christine Cavanaugh is the voice
-> of Chuckie].  Kath has also done some voice work for Disney: she's
-> done two Aladdin eps that I know of: she was the title role in "The
-> Entity" and she voiced a poor girl on the classic Aladdin ep "Do The
-> Rat Thing" where she spoke that timeless line: "It's the Magic
-> Holiday Rat!  She brought us a present from the Rodent King!"
also for disney she did one or two voices for "Goof Troop". also
Rob Paulsen <Antone> , Jim Cummings <Robotnik>, and William Windom
<Uncal Chuck> all did a voice for Goof Troop too.

Ahhh! Now I'm geting off topic!

It's not in the 'real' episodes, only the games.  It looks like the Death 
Star with Robotnik's ugly mug plastered across the side (sculpted, not 
painted) and no funky laser dent.  Hope this helps.  (;3

I can't speak for StH specifically, but I have noticed networks doing this
to shows which are being re-run. (One notable example being FOX with the
daily episodes of The Simpsons.) It's usually done just to get in more
commercial time.

I'm not thoroughly familiar enough with any episode to know for sure, but
I thought I noticed something missing (I've now forgotten what) in last
Sunday's show.  I'd say it's likely seeing how the show pretty 
consistently runs from 8:59 (Eastern) - 9:26 AM and we lose a minute of 
time in between for that monster thingy USA does in the second spot set.  
I'll try to remeber to check next time they run a show I've already got 
on tape from ABC or pre-recorded.

Any other observations?

If you're refering to last Sunday's "Game Guy," I thought I noticed one of
a few edits also, around the point where Sonic and Ari first arrive at the
Fortress. When the bot popped out, it appeared that some of Sonic's battle
footage was removed. I base this on the abrupt shift in background
sound/music and scenery. I'll have to pay closer attention to the details
now...

OK, here's a real question:

Has anyone ever released a Sonic the Hedgehog Screen Saver?

And if not, why not?

Hmm.. I just took a look at TPW that I recently bought, seems that you can
make screen savers with it. Problem is that I'm not really a Windoze coder
yet.. I'm a DOS man really. But when I do get into Windows coding, I'll see
about slapping one together. :)

Right now there are more important things to be done. :)

Now that I got that out of the way.  Time to start the story.
Note this is my first story, hope you enjoy it.
The story seems to drift from what you see to what Mechtail see's and back.
Sorry about that, every one has there own way of story telling, I'll get 
better at it as time goes on.
The time line is after Doomsday.
____________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 1

A factory somewhere in Robotropolis is busy with life if you could call it a 
life.  Worker Bots, mindless robot slave's which were once people are busy 
working at different tasks.  Through trapped in these body's every one is 
aware of what there are doing but are helpless to stop it.   Swatbots role 
off the ensemble line ready to be activated.  A Worker Bot is busy 
assembling Swatbot heads, a metal male squirrel in his late teens.   /*Boy I 
hate my job\*  The Work Bot thinks to him self.  /*If only I could stop, but 
NOO.. I can help it, my stupid program won't let me.\* /*Just think a month 
ago I was appointed leader or was asked to be one because Alice got killed 
during a mission.  At the time I thought it was a good idea like being the 
leader of the Eastern Freedom Fighters.  /*Through we were a very small group 
I think we held up pretty well.  I never went on many mission's to robo town 
because I didn't know my way around.\*  /*The other freedoms fighters found 
it odd that I never went along on thought's missions but I told them I didn't 
want to risk the mission if I got lost.  ALL what's the use every thing went 
wrong.  If I every get out of this I'll go home and stay there."\* 

"Worker Bot #549268217 report to the roboticizer room"  Came over the loud 
speaker.  /*Ohh not a again./*  The Worker bot stopped what he was doing and 
walked out the door.  /*I really, really hate this.\* In the roboticizer room 
Swatbots are holding a young female fox.  Packbell is smiling at her.  
"You'll never get a away with this." She saids.  "Yes, yes I heard it all 
before.  Besides what can you do to stop me?"  I walk into the room to see 
a fox looking at me very frightend.  "Ahh so there you are."  Packbell said.  
"AWAITING COMMAND SIR?" I said.  /*Yes you stupid electric toaster.\*  
"Take your position." I walked up to the controls.  "I'll give you one last 
chance to tell me where the rest your friends are hiding."  "NEVER I'LL DIE 
FIRST." I could see that PAC-MAN was getting angry. "Fine then, but what 
a have in mind is worse then death. Put here in the roboticizer"  The Swatbots 
put the young fox on the platform.  Packbell looked at me.  "Well get on with 
it, activate."  My body walked infront of the control panel.  /*NOOO DON'T DO 
IT STOP AHH.. can't control my self./*  My paw pushed some buttons and the 
roboticizer started its cycle, the glass tube came down over the fox and 
yellow bolts of what looked like lighting hit her.  Less then 10 seconds later 
she was turned into a Worker Bot.  The glass tube lifted up and the new bot 
walked out.  "AWAITING COMMAND SIR?"  /*Poor girl.\*  Little did I realize 
that a tear ran down my face.  /*A tear?\*  Packbell looked at me will a 
smile "Take her to factory #254 and assign her work." "YES SIR."  /*You'll 
pay for this PAC-MAN some day you will.\* 

I walked beside her as I led her to the factory not able to speak or stop. 
/*I wish I could say something to her, to help her, something to easy her pain 
but I can't.\*  /*I do believe that Packbell knows that Worker Bots still 
think for them self's but can't do anything else, that's why he calls me to 
the roboticizer either that or because I called him PAC-MAN before he 
roboticized me.  I think he is trying to torture me, and I'm sure he likes 
doing it./*

One day while I was busy do the job I all ways hate.  Something was going on 
outside.  "Sonic what are you doing?"  Asked Sally.  "Sorry Sal I'm board."  
"Well stop it we only have to wait another minute."  Sonic stopped tapping his 
foot.  "Do you have the charges ready Sonic?"  "Yep!" "Well give me half of 
them."  "Here you go Sal."  As he handed the bombs to Sally.  "There it is, 
Sonic, Power Station #12" Sally said.  "I see it, are you ready Sal?"  "Yes I 
got my new boots on, remember.   Here put Nicole in your back pack I have no 
room in mine. " And removing Nicole from the harness on her leg and gave it to 
Sonic.  There can be heard a small explosion a distance away.  "Ok it worked 
the Swatbots are leaving there post."  Sonic and Sally gave each other a 
kiss.  Then the two of them ran down towards the station and split into two 
different directions.  They entered the station, Sonic zipped into the front 
Sally in the back.  

Snively saw them enter the building from the control room.  Packbell was with 
him.  "There going to blow up my Power Station, DO SOMETHING!" Snively said to 
Packbell.  Packbell looked at Snively "No Swatbot would get there in time, 
even if they did, it is unlikely they will be able to catch them.  But I can 
seal them in the building, if the Station blows they will go with it."  There 
was smile on Packbell face as he hit a switch.  Sonic just lad down the last 
charge which was set to blow in 15 seconds.  Sonic whistled to Sally then the 
timers started.  Sonic look around, and to his horror, saw that the doors were 
closing.  "SAL THE DOORS! RUN!!!!"  Sonic ran as fast as he could towards the 
door,  he saw that Sally was right behind him.  Sonic ran outside,  Sally 
could see the door closing, there was enough time to make it through.  As she 
was running for the door her foot hit something and she tripped.  Sonic was 
going so fast that he was 25 feet from the door before he came to a stop to 
see Sally behind him, but she wasn't behind him.  "SAL!!!!"  Running back, the 
door shut.  "NOO SAL!"  Sonic did a triple spin trying to cut through the 
door. BOOOOOOM!!!!  Sonic was blown away from the blast a good 200 feet.  
Sonic looked as the building collapsed.  "SALLY!!"  Then Sonic passed out.
Dulcy found Sonic laying on the ground and pick him up and flew back into the
Great Forest.

Later Sonic woke up in Knot Hole.  "Sonic where's Aunt Sally?" asked Tails.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this the end of Sally and what about the Worker Bot how does he fit into 
this store well you'll just have to wait till the next chapter.

BYE.

Chapter 2

Sonic woke up in Knot Hole. "Sonic are you all right?"  Bunny asked. 
"Yes I think ouch.." Sonic looked up to see Tails. "Sonic where's Aunt Sally?" 
asked the two tailed fox.  Sonic look at Tails worried eyes. "I.... Tails hmm 
I'm... sorry she didn't make it."  Tails eyes open wide. "You, You mean she 
got caught right?"  Sonic could see Tails was ready to cry.  Sonic sat up to 
see Rotor, Rosie, Antoine, and Dulcy also in the same room.  "I sorry Tails
I wish that were so... she, she died in the explosion."  "All noo Sally Girl"
Bunny said.  Tails ran up to Bunny and grabbed her right arm and started 
crying.  "I tried so hard to get her out, but the door was too hard to cut 
through.  AND THEN THE BOMBS!."  Sonic said trying to fight back the tears.  
"Don't be so hard on your self son, it's not your fault."  Rosie said looking 
at Sonic.  "IT IS! I SHOULDN'T OF LET HER COME, SHE JUST WASN'T READY TO RUN 
LIKE ME."  Sonic could not hold back his tears any more.  Rosie went up and 
held Sonic.  The other freedom fighters went out of the room.  And started 
telling the news to everyone.

Back at Robotroplis around the same time Worker Bots and some Swatbots were
cleaning up the debre of what was left of the station.  Snively was also there   
"Have the Worker Bots work none stop until the station is rebuilt and report 
any bodes found to me."  Talking to a Swatbot.  Snively walked into his 
hover craft and flew away.  Worker Bot #549268217 was busy lifting a peace of 
paneling when he noticed a female squirrel or fox? lying under it, on the 
ground.  /*Ohh no not another one.\*  I could see she was not that old, she
was in her teens.  My body was about to lift her up when what appeared to be 
a gold ring fell out of her ripped back pack.  My program decided to pick it 
up also because it might be important.  As my paw clamped around the ring I 
felt incredible energy going through my body, it shorting out my systems left 
and right.  I fell over on to the body.  Then I pull my self up to find that, I 
got up by my self, /*What how did get control?\* I was free.  I looked again 
at the body and saw a finger move.  Something automatic turned on and I could 
see right through her */Hmm like a CAT scan.\*, her heart was beating but 
slowly.  She was alive, through barely.  I picked her up and the ring.  And I 
put the ring into a compartment in me. /*Now how do get out of here?\* 
Looking around.  /*Hmm yes I thing this will do it.\*   "ALERT, ALERT. 
FREEDOM FIGHTERS SPOTTED IN SECTOR 64C!."  The Bots stopped what the where 
doing and started running towards a building. /*Yes now to get out of here.\*. 

'Thump, Thump, Thump.' "SONIC... SONIC are you there?" Rotor said knocking     
at Sonic's hut.  "GO AWAY!"  "Sonic its been hours aren't you going eat?"
"No just leave me alone."  Rotor surged his shoulders and turned around. 
Walking up to Tails and Bunny. "It's no use he's not coming out." 
"Poor Sugar Hog he's really taking it hard."  Bunny said.  "Aunt Bunny we'll
Sonic every come out?"  Tails said looking at Sonic's hut.  "Yes I think he
just needs some time alone."  Sonic was looking through his window behind
the curtain and he saw Bunny, Tails and Rotor walking away.  He turned
around and started talking to him self, his eyes where red.  "Why, Why Sal
why not me?"  Slamming his fist against a wall.  "She is what has keep Knot- 
hole together, what can I do besides run.  I mean I am the leader but.. Sally 
makes most of the decisions, what good am I?"  Sonic sat on his bed and 
thought some more.  "What good will it do going after Pakerbell or Snively?  
Sally's gone."  Sonic sat for a good 10 minutes when he heard a beep.  Sonic 
looked around then heard another beep.  It was coming from his back pack.  
He opened the back pack saw Nicole.  Sonic grabbed Nicole and sat on his 
bed again.  "This is all I have left of Sally to remember her."  Sonic said.
Sonic thought some more then flipped open Nicole.  "Nicole why where you
beeping?"  Sonic said to the small computer.  "Sally has programmed me to 
remind her to log in once a day for her Diary." "Oh Nicole, Sally died today."
"I'm sorry to hear that Sonic it must be quite a loss to you, to lose some one
you love.  Through I am unable to morn her loss,  I will miss her input."
Sonic looked surprised.  "You mean you can't cry?"  "Correct I was not
programmed to cry.  But I will still miss her."  Nicole said with no change 
in it's tone.  "Sonic I have some files which have been created by Sally
and the King which are to be run in the event of Sally's death.  2 Files are 
marked For you only,  1 For Bunny, 1 For Tails, 1 For Rotor, 1 For Rosie and 
1 for Antoine.  There is also 2 files for the Freedom Fighters and 1 file 
which is Sally's Will."  "Nicole what are these files?"  Sonic said looking at 
Nicole. "The files are recorded messages, all have both audio and video.  Do 
you wish to display your files now?"  Sonic thought for a moment. "NO later."
Sonic closed Nicole and put it a side.  "Man I getting hungry!"  Sonic said 
as he walked out the door.

Somewhere in Robotropolis in a abandoned house,  Sally is laying on a bed, 
her left leg is being held straight by two pieces of metal with some torn up 
sheets. "mhf ah..."  Sally turned her head a bit then back.  Sally started 
opening her eyes.  What she saw was very blurry then the picture started to 
clear up, she could make out something red, no two red dots.  Then every 
thing was clear.  She saw a Worker Bot looking right at her.  "AAAAhmmm..."  
The Bot put his metal paw around here mouth.  "Shhh you want to alert every 
Swatbot in Robo town." Sally calmed down.  "Who are you, and how.."  "My name 
is not important but your safety is.  And how I can control my self?  Well I 
think it has something to do with a glowing ring you where caring."  Sally 
thought for a moment.  "Ok that makes sense.  Hmm How did you find me, where 
did you find me?"  "Boy you like asking alot of questions.  Well I found you 
while I was cleaning up a mess, I think you made, and well you where under it.  
And it was at where Power Station 12 use to be.  Hey nice job."  The Worker 
Bot said with a smile.  Sally smiled back.  "My name is Sally, who or what 
should I call you?"  The Worker Bot thought for a sec.  "Call me MechTail."
"OK MechTail,  Thank You."  Sally said looking at Worker Bot. *\He must have
been handsome, before he was changed./*  Sally thought.  There was silence
for a good 10 seconds.  "So what's a pretty lady like you doing in a place 
like this?"  MechTail said.  "Oh I thought I blow up a Power Station or two
today." Sally said trying to keep her mind off the pain.  "Yes I see, and you
did this all by your self?"  MechTail said.  "No I had help."  Sally said.
"Oh so you belong to a group of Freedom Fighters."  The metal squirrel said.
"Yes I do." Sally coughed a couple times.  "Well your quite hurt, you have a
broken leg and some cracked ribs.  Its a good thing you weren't awake when I
reset you leg."  MechTail said looking at her leg.  "You must be hungry and
thirsty by now?"  MechTail said then stood up.  "Just a little a guess."
Sally said trying not to worry him because she was very thirsty.  "OK stay 
here I be back, I'll hunt down some food."  MechTail said and walked out of
the room.  Then Sally fell a sleep.

Sonic didn't sleep very well that night, he keeped seeing Sally reaching for
him and then a door slamming shut in front of her face.  Every so often he'd
hear Sally's voice calling saying. "Why didn't you save me Sonic?" Then Sonic
would wake up sweating then try to get back to sleep again.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK that's the end of this chapter.
So Sally is a live but the Freedom Fighters think she is dead, so what 
happens next you'll just have to wate till the next chapter.

Now that I got that out of the way.  Time to start the story.
Note this is my first story, hope you enjoy it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapture 5

Sonic was on a one way course to Robotropolis.  */I'm comming Sally and no
one will stop me from saving you!\  Sonic incressed speed.

MechTail grabed Sally a draged her towards the roboticizer.  "No stop
MechTail you don't know what you are doing."  Sally tried to pull away but
she was too weak and the Worker Bot's grip was to tight.  "MechTail you got to
fight it!  Don't let them win!"  MechTail still keeped draging Sally towards 
the roboticizer.  Sally had one idea left.  She stop struggling, turned around to
face MechTail and kissed him on the lips.  MechTail stoped but only for a 
second and then pushed Sally to the ground.  Sally's attempt to break the  
program's control over MechTail didn't work, but however it awoke his mind.  
*/Whats going on?\*  MechTail grabed Sally and straped her into a chair.  
*/What am I doing? *\  "Good, now it's time to say good buy to your friend 
MechTail.  I know you just love to do this to her.  Just think you can be 
together forever serving us."  Packbell said grining.  "Enough of this drama 
roboticize her now."  Snively said looking at MechTail.  I walked up to  
the control panel.  Sally started yelling.  "FIGHT IT I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT,
I BELIEVE IN YOU!.  FIGHT 'ZAP' Ahaa..."  Sally was hit by a stun ray. 
Packbell was holding the weapon. "ACTIVATE!"  MechTail reached for the control
panel.  */NOOOO I WON'T LET YOU, NOT THIS TIME, NO MORE PAIN, NO MORE SLAVES,
NO MORE, AAAAA!\*  PAIN, his home, ANGER, Todd and Alice, RAGE, his friends
and now Sally.  MechTail's arm stoped, his body was shaking and the glow in 
his eyes was fading away.  "ACTAVATE!"  Packbell yelled.  Suddenly MechTail
stoped shaking and looked at Packbell.  "I DON'T THINK SO PAC-MAN!"  MechTail 
said as he punched a hole through the controls.  Sparks came from the control 
panel.  Packbell ran up to the control panel and pushed MechTail out of the
way.  Packbell tryed to shutdown the roboticizer power grid but with out luck.  
"It's over loading I can't stop it!"  Snively looked at Packbell.  "Next time 
do it your self!" "Ah shutup!"  Packbell said as he looked around.  The lights 
turned red.  "We got to get out of here, it's going to explode!"  Snively ran 
out the door.  Sonic was bashing his way through Swatbot's when he saw an 
electrical explosion from a building.  "SAL!"  Sonic ran for the building.  
Packbell was holding Mechtail by the throat.  "I should kill you right now!"  
I looked at Packbell.  "You already have."  Another explosion went off, the 
lights started flickering.  Packbell through MechTail aganst a wall then 
looked at Sally, she was still out cold.  Packbell walked out the door and 
closed it.  I managed to stand up and look around.  There was not much time 
left.  I saw Sally out cold and straped into a chair on the roboticizer.  
"What have I done?"  I unstraped her and pick her up and walked towards the
door.  Laying Sally down I looked at the door, a mode kicked in and I could 
see that the door was magnetily sealed.  I looked around and found the wires
feeding the power to the door.  "ACTIVATE LASER."  A laser beam emited from
my index finger, and I cut the wires. "OFF" I grabed the edge of the door and
pried it open.  The door opened half way when the backup hydrolics kicked
in.  The door started closing I could not stop it.  I grabed Sally and pushed
her throught the door before it closed. */At lest she has a chance to live.\*
Sonic zipped through the hall way.  "SAL ARE YOU HERE?"  Sonic turned a 
corner and saw Sally laying on the metal floor near a big door.  Sonic
picked up Sally.  "Sally?"  Sonic tryed to wake the sleeping Princess but all
he got was a mone.  Another explosion went off and part of the celling came
down.  Sonic saw what was happing and ran out of the building with Sally in
his arms.  MechTail looked around for a way out but the openings he found
where too small.  "Well I guess my stay on this planet will be short one.
Oh Todd what have you gotting me into."  The sound of the roboticizer cycling 
up can be heard but something is different about it.  Mechtail walked up 
to the roboticizer but keep his distance.  Suddenly there is an explosion 
of energy from the roboticizer, the energy seemed to know where MechTail was 
and covered him.  "Whats going on.. AAAAAa!"  The sound of his voice gets 
drowned out from the noise.  MechTail is surrrouned in energy and he can no 
longer be seen.  The drained power ring inside him starts glowing again, it 
gets brighter and brighter, so bright that the it can be seen through the 
energy surrounding him. 

Sonic got a good distance from the exploding building before he stoping to 
watch it.  Sally moved.  "Oh my head, what's going on? SONIC is that you?"
"Who do you think Robotnik?"  Sonic said looking at Sally. "Is MechTail here?"
Sonic looked puzzled.  "Mech who?"  an explosion can be heard.  Sally jumped
out of Sonic's arm's and landed on her good leg, almost fell over but got a
hold of Sonic.  Sally looked as the building went up in a blase of flames and
sparks.  "Oh no MechTail!"  Sally turned her head towards Sonic and stared 
crying.  "Sonic he saved me... he saved me from being roboticized!"  Sonic
looked at the building.  */He must have been behind that big door.\*  Sally
huged Sonic tight.  "It will be OK Sally.  He gave his life for you." Sonic
looked at the crying Princess.  "Let's go home Sal you need a doctor."
Sally looked at Sonic.  "Sonic why are you dressed in a tucks?"  Sonic looked 
at Sally with a smile.  "Well for you I guess."  Sonic kissed Sally and 
picked her up and ran back to Knothole.  Back at Knothole snoring can be
heard, Antoine is still busy giving his speech.  Sonic zipped up behind 
Antoine and set Sally on her feet.  Sally roles her eyes as Antoine is still
talking about her.  Sally hoped up behind him and tapped him on the shoulder.
"Pardon moi?"  Antoine said as he truned around.  "AAAAAA is ze ghost of me   
Princess, AAAAA!"  Antoine ran away yelling into the bushes.  The freedom 
fighters look in shock as Sally walked up to the petastel.  "Well I see you
have been busy.  Am I late for my own furnel?"  Sally explained what happend
to every one there.  "So you see I am alive a kicking, but there was a chance
that I could have died."  Sally said looking at every one.  "In this war,
there is always a chance that some one could get killed, but no mader what 
happens, we must continue the fight to for a free Mobus."  Sally looked 
at the freedom she was draned out.  She then said. "Since we have a grave set 
up already,  I would like to dedicate it to the one who died for me.  He 
called him self MechTail." Sally almost in tears again, hopped off and grabed 
on to Sonic for support as she went with him to see the Bookshire.


The End
Or is it?

That evening.
Back at Robotropois the bulidind where the roboticizer once, was is totaly 
distroyed.  But amounst all this trash there is a ball of energy.  The 
energy is very bright.  The energy subsides and the out lines of a creature 
can be seen.  Though it is still too bright to make out who it is.  The
creature stumbles out into the open of Robotropolis.  Swatbots see the 
strange glowing creature as it started to walk.  They tried to stop it.
Energy bolts from the creature distroyed the Swatbots in the way.  It again
started walking but this time towards the great forest.  Hoverbots arive to
stop the creature but get blown out of the sky.  As the creature walked into 
the great forest and the glow dispeared only a big bushy tail is seen as the 
figure dispeard.

Yes now it's The End.

Now that I got that out of the way.  Time to start the story.
Note this is my first story, hope you enjoy it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3 

It's was night in Robotropolis not that you could tell anyways.  Two Swatbots
are garding a door that leds to some holding sells.  A Worker Bot walks up 
to the bot's.  "HALT.  PLEASE STATE NUMBER AND RANK?"  One of the Swatbots
said.  "WORKER BOT #549268217 RANK TEC."  The Swatbot's looked at each other
then looked at the Worker Bot. "Please state password and reason for entery?"  
The Worker Bot look at one Bot then the other.  "Can I get back to you on 
that?"  The Swatbots looked at each other again.  That was not an expected
answer from a Worker Bot but since the Bot's where programmed to not atack a
Worker Bot they just stode there stuped.  The Bot's then turned around to an
empty space, where the Worker Bot was standing.  The Bot's looked both ways
but no sign of the Worker Bot.  Then from a near by alley a rumbling noise 
can be heard.  The Swatbots again look at each other then look towards the
noise.  Then out of noware a trash bin is rolling very fast towards them 
"HAL..." 'CRASH'  Both bots are hit by the bin and are pushed a good 10 feet
away before hiting and being crushed by the steal wall and the bin.  The 
Worker Bot walked up to the now empty door. "I guess my password was acceped."  
He said with a big smile.  Walking down stares the Worker Bot heard some 
crying and moping.  He stoped and looked around the couner and saw some 
people locked in cells wating to be Roboticized.  He then saw a Swatbot 
walking to the other end of the room then out a door. /*Well a long as I have 
control I should do soming.\* I walked up to the sells.  "Help us.  Please."  
A cat said looking at me. "If you want to stay alive Shhh.." MechTail said 
then walked up to the hand print computer. "Open all sells."  "Require hand 
print and keycode."  The computer said.  "Well I don't know the keycode but 
here's a hand print." MechTail made a fist and smashed the computer, spark's 
came from the computer and the sells opened, also an alarm went off.  All the 
prisioners got up and ran out of the building.  I just stood there as Swatbots 
ran in.  I pointed to another door. "CAPTURE FREEDOM FIGHTERS." The Swatbots 
turned and ran out through the other door.  /*Very good you stuped bots.\*  
I walked up to the food replacator.  "Oh yes I can't forget this."  MechTail 
pushed a button and grab the food and drink.

That morring the Freedom Fighters woke up but not that fast since there was
no hurry for what was about to take place today.  Sonic was the last one to 
get up he looked terrible but feeling a little better then yesterday.  Sonic
looked in the mirror. "Man who would every think I would look this bad in the 
morring."  Sonic grabed a jug of water and dumped it on him self.  "AAhaaaa
COLD, OH WAY PAST CHCCH oh A I must remind my self not to do that again. 
Sonic grabed the nearest towel he could fine and dried him self.  Sonic 
looked at his desk and saw Nicole on it.   "No. Breakfest first then Nicole.  
Sonic then looked in the mirror.  "Not bad."  Tails was wating for Sonic to 
come out of the hut.  The door opened and Sonic walked out.  "Sonic."  Tails 
barked.  "Oh hi Tails"  Sonic said.  "Are you OK now Sonic?"  Tails said 
looking consered.  "Ya I guess."  Sonic said looking at the two tailed fox, 
both started walking towards the kitchen.  "I thought you would never come 
out of there."  Tails said.  "Well I did yesterday for a short time."  Sonic 
said as they where walking.  "Well I understand, Sonic remember when you 
found me I didn't want to go anywhere untill I saw my Mom and Dad."  Sonic 
look at Tails and thought for a moment.  "Yes I do Tails, and I had to drag 
you out before more Swatbots came."  Sonic was feeling better, but he felt 
like kicking him self for not thinking of everyone else.  Sonic walked into 
the dining room to see his spot already had been set for him, and looking 
around he saw every one there.

In Robotropolis Packbell is sitting in the big chair when Snivley walked in.
"Whats the big idea waking me up this early in the morring?"  Packbell was
not amused.  "Sir we have a problem."  Packbell got out of the chair.
"What kind of a problem?"  Snivley sat in the chair.  "Three actualy.  One
no bodys where found.  Two a Worker Bot is missing.  Three some Freedom 
Fighters managed to escape from the holding sells in building 6."  Packbell
said to the short human.  "ANY GOOD NEWS?"  Snivley trying to wake up.
"Well yes I have found some fur and blood under the ruble, the DNA matches
Princess Sally."  Packbell said holding up a sample of fur.  "So if there's
blood she must be hurt."  Snivley said with a bit of a smile.  "Correct.
Also I have found out who the missing Worker Bot is.  Computer display 
profile on Worker Bot #549268217."  On the big screen a there are two pictures
that appear, one shows a squirrel in his teens whering a jacket and a belt 
with electronic componets atached to it.  The other picture shows him again 
this time robotcized. "Information states that he was the leader of an 
easteren Freedom Fighter group, he went by the name Mechtail.  Captured 32 
days ago and roboticized.  No more information on him."  Snivley sat in the 
chair and then said.  "And what about the break out?"  "I was just about to 
view the video recording when you came in.  Computer play video record from 
building 6, camera 3, time index 22:30.  The computer display switches to a 
view of cells with Mobians in them, a Swatbot walks by, then a Worker Bot
walks up to the sells saids something then turns around and walks to the
hand print computer, smashes it and the cells open.  "Computer stop.  Zoom in
on section 207X140 by 50%.  I do beleive we have found the missing Worker
Bot.  Computer continue."  The computer then shows Swatbots running in.  The  
Worker Bot points towards another door and the Swatbots run through the door. 
Then the Worker Bot walks up to a food replicator and grabs some food and 
drink.  "Computer end.  Now why would a Worker Bot need food and drink?"  
Packbell thinks for a micro second.  "He must be getting food and drink for
Princess Sally, it makes sense now.  The Worker Bot's last know location
was at where Power Station 12 was."  Snivley now fully awake is realising just
what Packbell said.  "But how can a Worker Bot just break his programing and
save the Princess?"  Packbell looking at Snivley.  "Well it is possible that
the Princess reprogrammed him, or his will is a lot stronger then we thought."
Snivley stood up. "Packbell reprogram the Spy-orbers and Swatbots to find 
them, check every buliding and abanded house."  Packbell then turned and 
walked up to the control panel and typed in the new orders.

Princes Sally woke up in the same bed with the same two red eyes looking at
her, but this time she was not surprised.  "It's good to see that your still
in the land of the living Sally."  MechTail said and handed her a glass of
water.  Sally took the glass of water and drank it all.  "Boy you must have 
been thirsty.  Well here is the best I could do for food."  MechTail handed 
her the prision food.  "Thanks"  Sally said and ate it all even through it 
tasted terrible.  "So how are you feeling today?"  Sally moved a little.  
"Better.  Anyways I got to get a message to the other Freedom Fighters, they 
probily think I'm dead."  Looking around.  "Well it's not safe to walk around, 
but staying here is no better."  MechTail stood up and walked a little, 
MechTail stop his face changed and he put his paw to his head.  "Oh what a 
headache, it's hard to think."  Sally look at MechTail and remembered when 
Sir. Chariles first got his free will back from a Power Ring.  "I'm sorry to 
say this MechTail but you woun't be in control much longer.  The effects of 
the Power Ring are only temperary."  MechTail looked back at Sally.  
"No I want to be free no more pain.  Please there has to be away?"  Sally sat 
up and put her paw on MechTail's shoulder.  "The only way is to be 
de-roboticized."  MechTail looked back at Sally.  "If only I could beleive 
that Sally, I have never meet anyone who has been de-roboticized."
Sally could see the pain in his eyes.  "You got to beleive me on this 
MechTail, my Freedom Fighter group has made a de-roboticizer once but it's
effects didn't last.  But one day it will work right and I will make sure that 
you will get de-roboticized."  Mechtail looked at Sally and streched out his   
paw.  Sally grabed it and MechTail helped her up.  "Besides you saved my life
it's the lest I could do."  Sally said with a smile.  "Well if I ever get out
of this Sally, you owe me a dance."  MechTail smiled.  "Sure thing.  Now if
you don't mind lets get going."  MechTail grabed onto Sally's arm and helped 
her up and out the door.

Now that I got that out of the way.  Time to start the story.
Note this is my first story, hope you enjoy it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 4 

Same day as the last chapter. 

The Freedom Fighters were busy preparing a funeral for Princess Sally.  They 
had a coffen made but there was no body for it so a picture was put in its
place.  The coffen was covered in flowers.  Freedom Fighters from around
the world where ariving to pay there respects, through not all the freedom
fighters around the world could make it because of situations beyond there
control and even some could not be reached.  Sonic was in his hut getting
dress up through he hated wairing clothes but he acceped the fact he had to.
Sonic looked around and again saw Nicole on his desk.  He finlly desided to
play his files.  He grabed the small computer and flip it open.  "Nicole
I think i'm ready to see my files.  Display."  A holagram of Sally appeard
before him.  The holagram started talking.  "Hello Sonic,  this is Sally
if you are viewing this file then soming must have gone wroung.  Don't
blame you self Sonic, we both know that each time we go on a mission there
is always a chance that we might not make it back.  If I died I'm sure it was
while fighting for a fee Mobus.  Or if I was roboticized, please don't lose 
hope Sonic, and don't go after me, I don't want you to see me that way.  I 
just want you to know that I beleave in you, you are the leader of the 
Freedom Fighters not by luck, you earned it Sonic, please believe in your 
self.  Well I can go on and on there is just too much to say.  But I know that
one day Mobus will be free again.  Good Bye Sonic The Hedgehog.
I love you."  The holagram disapeard.  "End of File."  Nicole said.  Sonic
sihed.  "Good Bye Sal."  Nicole then spoke up.  "There is another file Sonic
do you wish to view it?"  Sonic sat down on his bed.  "OK.  Display."
A holagram of King Acorn apeard then spoke.  "Sonic this file has been created
for you while I was in the Void and has been uploaded to Nicole from the 
freedom fighter list which I gave to Sally.  I just want to say how sorry I am
that Sally has died Sonic, through I am unable to know my self that she had
died I will find out in time with help Nogus.  I have also been able to view 
things happening on Mobus with help from Nogus and have watched you and Sally 
fight for Mobus.  Sonic since Princess Sally Alice Acorn has died there is
no one to take her place on the throne.  I may never leave this place Sonic 
and some one needs to take the throne.  I have choicen a person to take her
place.  Some one who has been by her side all her life.  I have no way of
making this offical,  but this file has in it all the prof that I could 
provide.  Sonic by The Royle House of Acorn I apoint you Sonic The Hedgehog 
as King of Mobus, Rule with Honer.  Rosie and other keepers of the Royle
house will help you.  Good Bye Sonic."  Sonic was in a daze, he sat for good
5 minutes and then said.  "I'm WHAT!."

MechTail and Sally are walking through a dark alley.  Sally is using a piece
of wood as a cruch and limping along beside MechTail.  MechTail signaled Sally
to stop as they approched a corner.  MechTail glances around the corner. 
One Swatbot is guarding the enterence.  MechTail steps back.  "There is one
Swatbot guarding the comuncations building, any ideas?"  Sally limped 
forward and looked around the corner, she then steped back.  "Well if Sonic 
where here he would just get the Swatbot to chase him."  MechTail put his 
paw on his head and droped to his knees.  "I'm not sure how much longer I can 
keep control.  We'd better hurry."  MechTail stood up again.  Sally looked at 
him.  "What we need to do is to distract the Bot so we can get in."  Mechtail 
looked around and spoted a piece of pipe and picked it up.  "OK while I 
distract the Swatbot you sneek in."  Sally looks at MechTail with anger.  "No 
I don't want you get hurt, I'm sure there is another way."  MechTail again 
put his paw on his head.  "We don't have time or I don't anyways.  I be fine 
Swatbots are programmed only to attack Freedom Fighters not Worker Bots."  
MechTail pushed Sally aside and walked out of the corner and walk right in 
front of the Swatbot.  The Swatbot just looked at the Worker Bot for a second 
then something went click inside.  "HALT WORKER BOT #549268217 YOU ARE TO BE
DETAND BY THE ORDER OF PACKBELL!"  MechTail look in horror as the Swatbot
walked forward to grab him.  MechTail swong the metal bar at the bot, the 
Swatbot just grabed it and through it a side.  MechTail jump out of the way.  
The Swatbot turned and walked forward trying to grab MechTail.  MechTail used 
his robotic legs to jump again but this time landing on the Swatbot shoulders. 
Sally watched MechTail fighting with the Swatbot.  MechTail look at Sally.
"GO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME GO!."  Sally limped as fast as she could through the
door. Unaware to both of them a Spy orbe was watching.  The Swatbot tried
to get a hold of the malfuncioning Worker Bot.  "SAY UNCLE, SAY UNCLE!."  
MechTail grabing the Swatbot's head and twisted it around.  Sparks flew every 
ware as MechTail ripped the Swatbot's head off.  The headless body fell over.  
MechTail landed on the ground still holded the Swatbot's head.  Sally limped 
the best she could even with the piece of wood it was taking time to climb a 
flight of stairs, she would have taken the elevator but she was not sure how 
safe it would be.  MechTail droped the Swatbot head and then ran into the 
building after Sally.  Sally reached the top of the stairs.  MechTail was 
starting to feel dizzy, the power ring was lossing its charge and he felt like 
he was sleep walking.  He saw an elevator and pushed the button the door slid 
open.  MechTail walked in and pressed a button.  As the door slid shut a hand 
grabed it and forced it open is was Packbell.  Packbell walked in. "Hello 
slave missed me?"  "Oh Shi.."  Mechtail said as the door closed. 

Sally limped into a comuncations room and headed towards a control panel.
She found a keyboard and started typing.  "Access Denied."  The computer said.
"This would be alot easier if Nicole was here."  Sally said and tryed again
but this time she used a password that Bookshire used.  "Access granted."
Sally hacked some more and typed in a message.  Just as Sally pressed send a
metal paw grabed her and pulled her away.  She looked around it was MechTail.
"Oh you scared me."  MechTail just stood there holded her tight his eyes 
were glowing red.  Packbell walked up behind the Worker Bot.  "Realy Princess 
you should know better then to play with equipment that does not belong to 
you.  I see you have meet one of my Worker Bots.  I don't know what you did 
but I fixed him, and now its your turn.  Worker Bot take the Princess to the 
roboticizer."  MechTail looked at Packbell.  "AS YOU COMMAND."  MechTail 
grabed Sally and walked out of the room,  Packbell was right behind them.

Back at Knothole the Freedom Fighters were siting and listening to speechs 
from good friends of Sally.  Sonic choosed to go last, he had a lot to think
about.  He was sitting besides Tails and Rotor.  Rosie just finished a 
tearfull speach and steeped down.  Antoine then walked up draging along a big
pile of paper.  Sonic mumbled.  "Oh man, were going to be here for hours."  
Ten minutes later.  Sonic mumbles.  "I'm veging real bad here, come on Ant.
I'm falling sleep."  'Beep, Beep.' "Well anything is better then this.  Whats 
up Nicole?"  "Sonic I have picked up a transmision from Robotropolis."  Sonic
scrached his head. "So?"  "Sonic I beleave the message is from Sally."
Sonic's eyes widen.  "What?"  Sonic jumped out of his set and ran straight
towards the pond. A power ring was appearing.  A freedom fighter on watch went 
up to grab it,  Sonic pushed him out of the way.  "Sorry I'm in a hurry!"  
Sonic grabed the ring.  "Nicole what's the message?"  "The message is in text.  
I will read it.  Sonic help in Robotropolis, Sally, BEAN."  Sonic closed 
Nicole and put the computer in a pocket since he was waring clothes. "I'M 
COMING SAL!"  Sonic lifted up the ring.  'BOOM'  Sonic was gone. 

"A home sweat home."  Packbell said as MechTail pulled Sally into the 
roboticizer room.  Sally look at Packbell.  "You may have me but the freedom
fighters will stop you some day."  Packbell looked at Sally with an evil
smile.  "I doubt it.  Now as soon as Needle Nose gets here we can get 
started!"  "I heard that!"  Snively said as he walked in.  "So good to see
you again Princess."  Snively smilled.  "Yes, I will succeed where Robotnik 
has failed."  Packbell wanted to say something then changed his mind.  
Sally turned her head to see MechTail behind her still holding her tight, his 
eyes glowing red.  */Poor Mechtail, I have got to get him back, but how?\*  
MechTail was totaly out of it.  All he could see was blured images fading in 
and out of his semiconscious mind, it was like he was dreaming.  Snively 
looked at Packbell.  "Care to do the honers?"  Packbell smiled.  "I have a 
better idea.  I will let her new friend do it.  Worker Bot put her in the 
robotiziser!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes I know you hate it when I do this but I next chapter well be along
very soon.

	First, to keep this letter to the context of this list, does anyone have 
a rough history of the Sonic world? Some body asked me for a plot and history (I 
think, have to reread the message) 
	Now, has anyone tested my RPG? I know some of you don't have much time, 
but those that do, how is it? (reply to me please) Feel free to sent me any 
characters that you deem worthy of me taking a look at. Oh, that's right...I 
don't know who's all making retyped versions of the RPG, so those who are, 
please send me a copy. (the first copy looked bad because of human error caused 
by lack of sleep) 
	How many Freedom Fighter groups are out there do you think? I know of 
the Knothole resistance, the Wolfpack, the Eastern and Western groups and my 
own, the Scarlet Bluebirds. (from the still half written story I keep rambling 
about to everyone)
	Any I should include? (Helps for RPG stuff)

Subject: Knothole's Origins

In the Sat. AM episode "Blast to the Past", it was established that 
Knothole village existed even before the coup.  Now, my personal theory 
is that it and other such secret villages were established as safe havens 
for the mobian royal family and citizens during the Great War.

There's only one problem with this idea: if the King knew of the location 
of these villages (as evinced by his list of Freedom Fighter groups), 
wouldn't his Minister of War (Robotnik) have known them as well?  I'm 
assuming that the King made the list before he was thrown into the Void, 
as he seems pretty cut off from the goings-on of Mobius now that he's in 
the Void.  Besides, how would Ari have known of the list if it hadn't 
existed before the King entered the Void?  Any ideas about either question?

Perhaps King Acorn didn't really trust his Minister of War as much as he 
seemed to, and so kept the locations secret from him.

Well, i heard on the list that someone wanted an AVI of the intro to the
SatAM Sonic show. I got it made, with sound... Its a hefty size though: 18
megs zipped, 28 undone. Its 120x180 (or some size like that), 11000htz
8-bit mono sound.  If you want it i'll upload it to rat.org, but it'll take
a GOOD while.. EVen at 28.8. :P

18 Megs???? 
That's rediculous. The one there without the theme song (just words) is only
2 megs. I think you
should compress the AVI before you send it to Rat.

I.e., you'd rather have no feedback at all than critical feedback?  :^)

OK, here are just a few somewhat neutral questions and comments:
(spoiler warning for those who haven't read it, and if anybody on my 
mini-mailing list wants a copy, let me know):

I guess I can accept that the power-ring's effect of freeing the will of a 
roboticized invidivual will work on others besides Uncle Chuck, but then 
the effect shouldn't have worn off like it did (actually, I assume 
Mech-Tail permanently regained his will at the end through sheer willpower 
like Uncle Chuck did too, so I guess that worked after all...)

I'm somewhat surprised that Packbell took orders from Snively the way he 
did...

I don't know if I can believe the combination of an exploding roboticizer 
and a used power ring can _unroboticize_ somebody (which is what I assume 
the end meant).  However, here's an idea for your next story: yes, this is 
what happened, but the process left MechTail charged with an unstable 
energy (insert Tech-babble here) that will kill him unless taken care of -
one choice would be re-robotization (or is is re-roboticization?), another 
would be a noble sacrifice saving the others, and there's the quasi-happy 
ending whereby he's cured, but the total process won't work again for 
anybody else (standard plot device...)

You might have wanted to put your note about your spelling and grammar 
needing work at the front of the story, that way Dan Drazen would save some 
ink in his editor's pen :^)

All in all, not bad - bring on the next one!

I was at Bookshire's page and saw all the stories there, what I'm wondering
is what is the order they should be read in story wise.

I realize that it might not make a difference with stories by different
authors, but some authors have used other others characters and I'd like to
know the order they should be read in. Thanks.

I did compress it. I used the same compression format that was used ont he
Wheezer.avi from the Win95 cd. Used Digital Video Prodicer ot edit the AVI.
Was 52 megs in uncompressed AVI. *shrugs* I coudl try it again, but it cant

That's a pretty tall order, Michael!  I'm not sure I can even remember 
all the stories!  There is one recommendation I can make, though: read 
"Tolouse's (sp?) Story", "Run With the Fox", and "On my Mother's Grave" 
in that order and before you read "Nothing for Granted".

Oh yeah, read "Starship Down" before reading "Everything Changes" or 
"This Island Floating (I think that's the title, anyway)".  After 
"Starship Down", there are one or two other stories featuring Joseph, a 
character introduced in "Starship Down", that you should read before 
reading the latter two.  Unfortunately, I can't remember their titles.  I 
hope this helps!

Top downwards, this is the order in which they were more or less created..=

Like I said before sorry about the spelling and grammer.
I do better in my next story.
Anyways the effects of be de-roboticized like that can happen only once.
It would be too hard to recreate the accedent anyways.  The power ring he
been intergrated into his nerves system and has stablized more or less for
now that may change.  After all has a power ring ever killed anyone.

I remembered that about 8 hours after I sent my message - oops....
I don't know whether this is a negative or neutral observation, but the 
story read so much like a pre-Doomsday story that I forgot that it wasn't 
supposed to be one...

Hi I have been wondering for a long time if what i heard was a dream!

I could have sworn that the intro theme for the sat. show.. changed.

I seem to remember a different version.. of it. same graphics. but 
different music..

i have a copy of the current theme.  

This particular one.. was in the major key.. all the way through.

Take a look and listen to the current one..   When Bunnie pulls the grate off
it changes key to the more upbeat major key..   

i used to i think have this theme (major all the way) but now i cant find it..


does it exist?  if so can some kind soul do it at 44khz stereo and let me know!


Thank you.. 

I can be reached at the email address below or 
as Sally on furrymuck or Furtoonia!

Thanks in advance..  I want this mystery solved!

	Nope, you aren't dreaming....there is one episode, that has a 
slightly different theme song to it.  It was one of the first eps aired 
on ABC.  If they've changed it or not now I have no idea because of the 
visually disabled country I live in.  (No USA network)  Anyway, the song is 
sung in a slightly different key, and has a really weird style to it.  IMO I'm 
glad they changed it.  I'll see what I can do about making a wav of 
it...pretty sure I have it someplace.

All uploads for rat.org should go to the /incoming directory.  If you 
don't have ftp access, you can mail your file to rat@rat.org.  All 
uploads are subject to approval.

Well, according to just about every single fantasy story I've ever read (at
least all the ones that included dragons), dragons live for millenia, and
thus, grow pretty slowly.  So, for all we know, Dulcy could be 10 times the
age of everyone else, but still less mature.

<Shrugs> IMHO, it's not about ANY of the facts that have been posted here.
The way I see it, furry sex is pretty tasteless, and the only thing that
ticked me off about the pix' removal was the idea that we might lose the
fanfic and other pix as well.  Of course, that's just MY opin, and if
anyone out there happens to be turned on by naked cartoon animals, that's
not my biz.                             ><

Well all I can say about that is.
The only pevrs stuff around is located at Furry Muck.
Another sight I can't seem to get anyware with use to be at www.ripco.com.
I think most of the sights have been cleaned up.
Almost no way and no how is anyone going to find pevrs Sonic stuff.

I have the opening theme as a .wav file.  However, its only 11khz mono (I 
have an old soundcard).  I haven't noticed any changes in the theme.  
But, of course, I haven't been listening for them.  I'll have to keep my 
ears peeled from now on!  Though, I can't see any reason anyone would 
want to change the theme song.

By the way, I think you can download the theme song as a .wav from 
http://rat.org.  The file's called (I think) sonic-th.zip.

This is a good example of an off topic post.
Anything regarding the technical workings of my site (note it's spelled SITE,
like "launch site" and "construction site") should be directed to me and not
the list.
Nobody reply to this on the list. Thanks.

That's the question I wrestled with as well.  My solution, as spelled
out in Chapter 2 of my fanfic "Capture The Flag," was that Knothole had
been thought of as a safe haven, then a royal retreat once the tide of
battle had turned.  I never got around to saying so, but Robotnik (dba
Julian) wasn't in the loop, though Sir Charles Hedgehog was.  That also
explains how the ring generator got there.

The business with the list, OTOH, is a serious plot hole.

There is no "Westewrn" group mentioned in the TV series: the "list" is
supposed to have included the names of 5 groups -- don't know whether
Knothole is even ON the list.  Aside from the Wolfpack, Southern and
Eastern groups are specifically mentioned in the Doomsday ep (their
representatives, respectively, were Paolo and Dirk).  If you want to
include the Archie comics, we've run across the Forty Fathom Freedom
Fighters and the Downunda Freedom Fighters in the course of the Tails
miniseries.

Always room for one more, right?

I would be disappointed by those additional years of partial 
roboticization getting put upon her if that had been true.  Sure, she 
makes some use of her robotic limbs, but surely you don't want her to be 
roboticized, do you?  You can see Bunnie in a "Bot On The Spot" portable 
roboticizer in the Archie comics.  I don't remember the issue number but 
I think it's somewhere 1-10.  In that issue, she is clearly not a little kid.

Hello again!
     During the past couple of weeks I thought up of a couple of
ideas (maybe they are even good enough for your FAQ Dan).

     First of all, I have an opinion on Sonic's speed:
He was born the same as he is now, except for his speed (Blue
hedgehog with a cool attitude, but with normal speed). Then, one
day, he came in contact with a very strong power source (This
happened before he was five, since in "Blast to the Past" he
already had his speed <Chuck's ring prototype?>). His body got
filled with energy, and to keep themselves from disintegrating(?),
his cells had to mutate (there was plenty of energy to do that).
First of all, the cells reconfigured themselves to be able to take
in energy at great speed (thus no fatigue from running too fast),
and they also needed a safe way of getting rid of that energy.
Giving it off as heat energy would probably burn the body
(literally), so the next best method it could think of was KINETIC
ENERGY! (the muscle cells now can expand and contract very quickly,
thus burn off anergy safely, quickly, and at the same time, kick
some fat butt). Now the only problem that Sonic has, is that
"addiction" to chilli dogs, junk food, and any other fatty foods
that can provide a lot of calories (hey! another explanation!).

     I got my copy of the tapes last saturday (thanks Ron), and I
couldn't find the map that's printed out so clearly in my head (in
fact, I can recall every detail of the picture). Also I was
disappointed when in Blast to the Past, I saw that Bunny was not
robotisized when she was a kid. I also had a "snap-shot" of her
being robotisized as a kid in my head, and believed 100 percent
that that was true. I also believe 100 percent that Sally is about
2 month older that Sonic, but can't find any proof (I feel about
that about as much as I feel about birds being able to fly). And
last, I really think that after Doomsday, and Robotnik's thought
off defeat, Robotnik will come back in about two month (very
disfigured, but nothing a little plastic surgery can't fix). Am I
so obsessed with Sonic that my brain attracts information directly
form Mobius? (sounds like an episode of X-Files) I have no idea.
The only thing I know is that I just all of a sudden know some part
of that world, and can't get it out of me.

     One more thing. In the episode Heads or Tails (the very badly
drawn one in comparison to others), Sally Alicia looks exactly like
the one in the game Sonic Spinball (what was made first, DiC
episodes, or the game? And what was based on what? And why the heck
is there Sally <and Bunny, and the rest of the gang> in the game,
but there is no Knothole, Snively, or anything else we've come to
admire? And why am I taking up all your valuable time with all
these questions?)

     Thank you for your time (are you actually still reading?)

Visions in the Wind: Beginnings

by Ed Becerra.

-----------------------------------

   A rolling prairie, somewhere on Mobius.

   It's nighttime.

   A coyote is sitting in the grass, legs crossed, in front of a small,
dying fire.  He looks up, to the distant stars.  His eyes glow with a
brilliant golden light.

   He hasn't taken either food or water for some days now.  He's been
fasting, for a spiritual quest.  His name is Edward Anthony Coyote, but for
some time now, the rest of the Wild Pack has simply called him "Kickaha".
It means 'Trickster' in the old tongue.  They had a good reason for it.

   Kickaha's spirit isn't here.  That's what the fasting is supposed to do.
Free the spirit from the body.  Right now, Edward's spirit is speaking with
his guide.

   Somewhere else...

   *Alright, alright, already!  I'm here.  Whaddaya want this time?*

   #There's someone new on Mobius.  Someone I want to meet.#

   *There's someone new on Mobius every day.  They're called "babies".
<snicker>*

   #I _meant_, there is someone new on Mobius, who isn't _FROM_ Mobius.
He's from the Earth.  I think he's one of my children.#

   *Hey, you got enough children to fill a sports stadium.  What do ya need
with this one?*

   #I believe he's one of _us_.#

   *Uh-oh.*

   #Uh-huh.#

   *So...  Why haven't you spoken to him about it?*

   #I've tried.  He can't hear me.  Somebody needs to tell him about me, an=
d
point him in the right direction.  Towards me.#

   *Lemme guess.  I'm elected.*

   #Bright boy!  Give that coyote a peace pipe and tell him what he's won.#

   *If I know you, it's a no-expenses paid trip to the other side of
Mobius.*

   #Right the first time.  So here's what I want you to do.  You're going t=
o
travel to the Great Forest, and find a hidden village called Knothole.
That's where Princess Sally's Freedom Fighters live.  When you get there,
find the tall fox with the robotic arm called Davey Crockett.  He's the
one.#

   *I thought you said he was from Earth.  They only have humans there.*

   #It's a long story.#

   *Right.  Figures.  So I'm supposed to guide him to you, the way the
shaman did with me?*

   #Yes.#

   *Fifty Mobians says it's a VERY long walk.*

   #You'd win that bet, if I'd taken it.  So you'd better get back to your
body, and get started.#

   *Just my luck.  How am I supposed to recognize him?*

   #He's got a cyborg arm.  How hard can it be?#

   *_That's_ a stupid question, Old Man.  You're a spirit of mischief.
Murphy's your beer buddy and poker pal.  Whatever CAN go wrong is definitel=
y
GONNA go wrong.  You think I haven't noticed?  With our luck, there's
probably five hundred cyborg foxes out there.*

   #<embarrassed look> Never mind that.  Just go.  With your injuries,
you're going to need all the head start that you can get.  Besides, there's
a surprise in it for you.#

   *What?*

   #If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.  Now go.#

   *All right.  But you're going to owe me for this one.  Big time.*

   There is a quiet moment.

   #Thank you...  Grandson.#

   *Don't mention it...  Grandfather.*

    =20
   Back on the prairie...

   Kickaha rises painfully, and if there were anyone watching they'd notice
his twisted back as he stands.  The golden light fades from his eyes.  He
reaches for the ironwood throwing cane lying beside him.  He ties up his
bedroll, and lashes it to his pack.  He carefully puts out the coals of his
campfire and throws his pack across his shoulders.  Taking his cane in his
right paw, he limps off into the starry night.

   "Now, if I can only remember which way the Great Forest is..." he
mutters.  "Rassafrassin' furshlugginer felgercarbin' @#^$=A2=A4*%&!...  "

   His voice fades into the silence.

   To Be Continued...

Visions in the Wind: Walkabout

by Ed Becerra.

-----------------------------------

   Some days later...

   "So this is what things looks like when you've got rain on a regular
basis.  Kinda beautiful." said Edward Anthony Coyote.  "Bit damp for the
likes of me, though.  Funny to see _green_ grass everywhere, instead of
brown buffalo grass, cactus, and tumble weeds."

   Kickaha had left his native dry, wind-swept desert prairie far behind
him, and had just reached the edge of the Great Plains that lay next to the
Great Forest.  He still had a ways to go before he reached the forest and
could start looking for the village of Knothole and it's famous Freedom
Fighters.

   He lifted his muzzle and sniffed at the wind.

   "I smell water.  Good thing, too.  Been a long way since that last water
hole.  Cain't hardly eat jerky without water.  Gotta refill my water skin.
Hmmm...  Smells like it's in that direction."

   He turned in the direction the scent was coming from, and limped slowly
off towards it.  He was moving a little stiffly.  His back and legs were
bothering him again.  It was the damp climate.

   He looked around.  "Better start looking out for those furshlugginer
SWATbots.  I'm a lot closer to Robotopolis, now.  Probably got regular
patrols out this way, hunting for any poor fool dumb enough to leave the
protection of the forest.  And right now, that means _me_.  I wonder why I
haven't seen any already.  Robotnik's usually quite the paranoid.  Used to
be he'd have 'bots patroling out along the edge of the prairie.  But that
stopped some time ago.  Something's happened.  But what?  He's evil and a
more than a little stupid, but not careless."

   Kickaha pondered these thoughts as he walked, his cane thumping
rythmically on the ground beside him.  The scent of water was growing
closer.  The conclusions he was coming to worried him.  He didn't like that.

   "Dammit!  The tribes just don't have enough information on how the
rebellion is going.  I _told_ the shaman that, more than once.  We need
connections to groups who are closer to the fighting.  Well, once I get
ahold of this 'Davey Crockett' Old Man Coyote wants to talk to, maybe I can
convince Princess Sally to share what her freedom fighters know with the
Wild Pack." he growled to himself.

   He sighed.  One more job to do.  Didn't the work _ever_ end?  Wasn't it
enough that he was mashed up in that stupid accident?  Hadn't he done
enough, already?  He snarled angrily.  All he ever really wanted out of life
were a few good books and a little time to read them.  But duty called, in a
tone he couldn't resist.

   He could hear the babbling of the small creek now.  And, in the distance,
an odd, whining noise that was rapidly coming closer.

   *Crud!  That's a hovercycle!  SWATbots for sure!*
     
   He yanked a camoflauge tarp from his pack, wrapping it around himself.
He dropped to the ground, looking for all the world like a clump of grass
and dirt.  He gripped his cane tightly.

   *Okay, maybe they haven't noticed me yet.  If so, then I've got the
advantage of surprise.  Best use it for all it's worth.  One coyote against
several Swats ain't good odds.* he thought.  *Gonna need every advantage I
can get.*

   Looking underneath the edge of the tarp, Kickaha could see the cycle
coming in for a landing near the edge of the small creek.  The whining sound
stopped, as the Swat piloting it shut down the engine.  There were two of
them, the pilot and one Swat riding shotgun behind it.  REALLY riding
shotgun!

   *Damn!  That's gotta be the biggest shotgun I've ever seen!  From here,
looks like a USAS-12 12-guage fully automatic assault shotgun.  With a
ten-round clip, at that.  And it's carrying plenty of extra clips.  Old Man
Coyote is REALLY gonna owe me for this one.  I'm not a fighter anymore, just
a crippled-up ex-soldier and shaman-in-training.  Oooh...  just wait 'til he
gets my bill!  I'm gonna demand an entire library for this one!  May the
fleas of a thousand prairie dogs infest his fur!  May he...  Whoops, here
comes one!*

   The SWATbot with the big shotgun dismounted from the hovercycle, and
started circling around it, searching the area in an ever widening pattern.

   *They must have spotted me, or they wouldn't have landed and started a
search.  But they're not certain where I am.  That gives me a chance.  Not
much, but it's better than nothing.  Better let the Swat come to me.*

   He could hear the clanking of the SWATbot's joints as it approached his
hiding place.  *Heh.  It's joints sound even noisier than mine.  Guess it
could use a little oil.  Well, so could mine.  It's almost here.  Get
ready...  Get set...  * he thought.

   Then something happened.  A huge black raven swooped out of the sky,
pecking at the Swat's eyes.  The SWATbot raised it's shotgun and turned to
fire at the attacking bird.

   *HEY!  It's back is to me!* This thought flashed through his mind as he
leaped from under the tarp, gripping his cane with both paws.  One claw
touched a stud hidden among the carvings that decorated it.  A twelve inch
long steel spike with razor sharp edges shot out from the base of the staff.
He jumped up behind the Swat, swinging his cane overhead, like the short
spear that it had become.  A heartbeat later, the Swat had a full foot of
blade buried through the back of it's head.

   Kickaha looked down at the dead 'bot.  *I really must remember to thank
the Timber Wolf tribe for this cane.  And compliment them on the quality of
the steel they make.  They _said_ it would cut right through a SWATbot.  And
they were right.* Pulling his cane out of the swat's head, he pressed the
stud again, retracting the blade.  He took note of the weapon the 'bot had
dropped when he had spiked it.  *Humph.  Be a cryin' shame to let a
perfectly good shotgun like this go to waste.* He picked it up, and
unbuckled the belt full of extra ammo clips the 'bot had around it's chest.
He slung the ammo belt over one shoulder, and checked the weapon.

   *Hey, HEY, hey!  There's a round chambered, the clip's full, and the
safety's...  off.  Whoa!  Lucky for me it didn't go off when it hit the
ground.  Thank the Great Spirit for grip safeties.  And the selector
switch's set to full auto.  Stupid 'bot.* He reset it to single shot.
*Guess they just don't program SWATbots like they used to.  Now to go 'bot
hunting!*

   He dropped his pack to the ground.  The raven who'd saved his life hopped
over to it, and pecked at it.

   "Quiet, bird!" he whispered.  "Do ya want that other 'bot ta blow yer
head off?"

   He slipped into the tall grass on the bank of the creek, circling in the
opposite direction from the defunct SWATbot.  Moving slowly, cautiously, he
spotted the remaining swat waiting with robotic patience on the cycle.

   *Can you say `Dead Meat', Mr. Swatbot?  Good.  I knew you could!*

   He stepped out of the concealing grass with the shotgun raised.  The 'bot
on the cycle whirled around when it sensed his approach.  But not fast
enough.  Kickaha pulled the trigger three times.  The slugs hammered the
swat's chest in, knocking it backwards over the seat of the hovercycle.
When it tried feebly to rise, he let it have four more rounds.  These shots
ripped completely through the 'bot's body shattering it's chest, and tearing
the 'bot apart.

   "Hey, HEY, hey!  Looks like I can _ride_ the rest of the way to the Great
Forest.  Finally, a little good luck, for a change!" he gloated.  He walked
forward to dump the second swat's body from the seat.  Suddenly, he heard a
hissing, crackling noise coming from it's corpse.

   "Oh, crud!  Not again!" he growled, dropping to the ground, and rolling
quickly into the nearby creek.

   ! ! ! B O O O O M ! ! !

   The SWATbot, and it's hovercycle, exploded in a fireball of destruction.
When the flames died down, there was nothing left but a few small pieces of
metal, a lot of ashes, and a small crater near the banks of the creek.

   Edward crawled out of the small creek, covered in water weeds and mud,
his fur soaking wet.  He still gripped his cane and the SWATbot's shotgun,
though.  _Kickaha's_ shotgun, now.  He bent painfully, and fished the ammo
belt from the bottom of the stream.

   He turned toward the smoking crater, and gave it a dirty look.  "Damn!
Must have hit the power supply.  Or a booby trap.  Guess it's still the old
Leather Personel Carrier for me.  Well, no use crying over spilled oil.  At
least I came out of this with more than I came in with.  This shotgun's
gonna be pretty useful if I run into more SWATbots.  Speakin' o' which,
gotta grab my gear and get going.  If that blast didn't get the attention of
every SWATbot within ten miles, then I'm Snivley's brother-in-law!" He shook
the water and mud from his fur as best he could, and headed towards his
backpack.  "I _hate_ walking, I do, I really, really do." he muttered.
"Well, that's not true.  I _like_ walking.  It's the back pain that I really
_HATE_!"

   When he got to the spot where he'd left his pack, he saw the large black
raven was still there, perched on top of it.

   "Hey, guy!  Thanks for the help, but I gotta run now.  And so should you.
Pretty soon, this place is gonna be hip-deep in SWATbots." He reached for
the pack, folding up the camo tarp and stuffing it inside.  He turned to say
goodbye to the raven, but when he saw what was happening to the bird, he
couldn't get out a single word.

   The bird's body was blurring, stretching, and changing.  A golden light
surrounded it.  It grew larger.

   Before Kickaha stood a four-legged coyote, as large as a small pony.
Then it changed again.  From four legs, it went to two.  It's fur peeled
back.  It was as if a human was crawling out of a cocoon of coyote skin.
When it was done, a man stood there, wearing what seemed to be a coyote-skin
headdress, complete with the coyote's head.  He smirked at Ed.

   "The Cheyenne call me Wihio, the Sioux, Iktome.  The Blackfeet call me
Napi Old Man.  The Cree call me Saultaux, the Micmac, Glooscap.  I am the
Great Hare on the East Coast and Raven on the West.  But you can just call
me..."

   "...Old Man Coyote!  What are you doing here?!  I'm already _doing_ what
you asked!" Edward growled angrily.  "You didn't need to check up on me!  I
keep my word and pay my debts, Old Man.  You _know_ that."

   "I'm not checking up, I'm apologizing."

   "... huh ...?"

   "Those swatbots were my fault.  I knew you were still having trouble
walking.  So, I decoyed one here so you could count coup, and take his
hovercycle.  But two showed up, instead.  Two swatbots again one coyote with
a bad back is unfair odds, so I lent a hand.  But I didn't plan on the cycle
exploding."

   "Oh.  Heh!  Well, neither did it!  I'm not hurt, I counted two 'bots, and
I've taken trophy from one." He held up the shotgun and ammo belt.  "I've
lived with the pain before, and it hasn't stopped me yet.  So, I might as
well get a move on.  There's a Great Plain to cross before I can reach
Knothole and find Davey Crockett." Kickaha shrugged, picked up his pack,
slung the shotgun and turned to go.  "But it's nice to know you still
care...  Grandfather."

   He trudged off towards the Great Forest, cane in paw.  Coyote watched him
go.  Kickaha was almost out of sight, when Old Man Coyote left.  He blurred
into the form of a large black crow.  And as it flew away, the wind
whispered...

   "Take care of yourself... Grandson."

	Ok, I have way to much time on my hands right now so I'm writing this to 
sort of talk and get a few questions awnsered.
	40 Freedom Fighter Groups!!!! (in the comic and our own)....I never knew 
there were so many. Robotnik has a lot against him doesn't he? If I were him, 
I'd have given up a long time ago and nuked the Great Forest and be done with 
it. (Then I would nuke the rest of the world to be on the safe side)
	Is it me, or are Stealthbots unreliable? Anyone could work wonders with 
them but Robotnik hardly uses them. Mass an army of them and as stated above, 
nuke the world. (Ok, it's not that realistic, but it would be fun!)
	Last comment/question: Will someone give me comments, suggestions, at 
least something on my RPG? I would like to perfect it before Ratman gets a copy 
of it. I know you probably don't have much time (or mabye you do) on you hands, 
but it only takes a minute (err...hour or two) to play a game. 
	But that really isn't why I'm here, so I'll shut up.
		Thanks,

I was trying to clean out old mail (and old cancelled 'attempts' at mailing)
and accidently sent that month-old letter to the list.

I could go on to describe exactly what and why but its just not worth the
bother.

By the way.... Anyone get Sonic #33 yet (I think its 33... it could be
32... its the one with Sonic being attacked by slimy stuff on the cover?)
I got my copy about a week ago from the comic shop and haven't heard anyone
talk about it yet.

Now that I got that out of the way.  Time to start the story.
Yes right where the story MECHTAIL left off.
I have fixed up all the mistakes I could find, but there is a chance I missed
some.  I'm getting better at this, really.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gray squirrel can be seen laying down next to a tree, he is warring a brown 
jacket.  "Ohh my head where am I?"  The squirrel sat up.  "Man I have a 
headache this big a is screaming for aspirin."  He scratched his head.  
"What fur?"  The squirrel look at his paw and sreached out his fingers.  
"How?  I was metal and now flesh."  The squirrel pulled on some fur on his 
leg.  "Ouch I'm not dreaming."  He stood up smiling.  "Yes!  I'm Back!"  
The squirrel looked at him self.  "Well more or less I am."  He then ran 
around and jumped here and there.  "Boy I have missed feeling alive.  How
did this happen?  It's as if some one has given me another chance at life." 
He looked around "Where to now?  The sun sets in the west I think, and rises 
in the east.  He looked at the sky. "Or is it the other way around on this 
planet."  The squirrel shook his head.  "I have been on here too long."  He
said as he walked away into the great forest.

Two weeks later.  "Face it MechTail your lost."  He look around. "I'm back to 
where I started.  Where's a map when you need one?"  The squirrel pulled out 
some nuts and berries from his pockets.  "Man where's a McDonalds when you 
need one.  I'm getting sick of eating nuts." He ate what he had and sat down.
*\Oh boy what now.  Maybe some one around here can point me in the right
direction."  "FREEZE FREEDOM FIGHTER!"  He looked around but no Swatbots.
Some blasters can be heard from a distance.  "HELP!"  MechTail jumped up an 
ran towards the noise.  He poked his head through the bushes and saw a young 
male hedgehog being dragged by a Swatbot.  *\I've got to do something but 
what?\*  MechTail made up it's mind and jumped out in front of the Swatbots.  
"LET HIM GO!"  He yelled.  The Swatbots turned to face the Squirrel.  
"SURRENDER FREEDOM FIGHTER!"  "I don't think so!"  Mechtail said as he lunged 
forward.  One Swatbot fired, Mechtail jumped out of the way.  Then he made 
another run at the Swatbots.  Again a Swatbot fired just missed his head.  
Mechtail attacked the closest bot he could see, he ran towards the bot and 
tried to ram it.  'TANG'  "OUCH!"  The bot landed on its but.  Mechtail landed 
face first on the ground.  He sat up holding his right shoulder.  "You 
stupid.  I'm not metal anymore."  The Swatbot got up and grabbed Mechtail, 
but grabbed his hurt shoulder.  "AAAAAA! THAT HURTS!  LET ME GOOOO!"  The 
squirrel's eyes started glowing, it was a golden glow that became brighter.  
Mechtail's voice changed, it be came deeper.  "I SAID LET ME GO!"  The 
Swatbot holding Mechtail exploded into pieces.  The squirrel's paws started 
glowing also.  Energy from his body flowed into his hands.  Mechtail stood up 
looking at the bots with rage.  The Swatbots fired.  The beams hit him and he 
fell to the ground, then he stood up again.  The beams have been azorbed and 
the energy channeled back into his hands.  Energy surged through out 
MechTail's body as he raised his hand almost instinctively.  A blast of energy 
flowed out of MechTail's hands and blasted the hole group of bot's into 
shrapnel.  Only one Swatbot remained, the bot was guarding the small hedgehog.  
Mechtail turned towards the Swatbot and walk towards it.  The small hedgehog 
could see that the tall squirrel with glowing eyes was headed towards him, he 
was struck with fear.  The Swatbot grabbed his laser rifle and fired at 
Mechtail, no effect he keep coming closer and closer.  I looked like a seen 
from T2.  The hedgehog started yelling.  The Swatbot fired again.  Mechtail 
walked up to the Swatbot and touched it.  "Tag your it!."  The Swatbot shorted 
out and fell dead on the ground.  The hedgehog whimpered.  "Da. ..da don't 
hurt me."  Mechtail stopped his eyes changed back to normal.  He was silent 
for a moment, he was trying to understand what just happened.  He then looked 
around at the picese of Swatbot's scatered around the feild.  He then looked 
at the trembling hedgehog who was covering his eyes.  "It's ok now the danger 
has passed."  MechTail said.  The hedgehog opened his eyes and looked at the 
squirrel smiling at him.  "You.. your eyes they glowed and you blasted the 
bots with your paws,  I..I thought you where going to blast me."  Mechtail 
looked at the hedgehog.  "I would never do a thing like that.  Now go home 
before any more Swats show up."  The hedgehog jumped out of the hover craft 
and ran into the bush.

Mechtail was alone again.  He looked around at the trashed bots.  "Now how 
did I do that?"  He then looked at his paws.  */It has to be a side effect
of the roboticizer, when it exploded.\*  Mechtail had a bit of a smile on his 
face.  He then looked at the hover craft and walked into it.  "Now where is
that navigation panel?"  Mechtail looked at the controls.  "A ha."  He pushed
some buttons and the computer came to life.  "COMPUTER BRING UP A MAP OF THE 
GREAT FOREST AND PRINT OUT A HARD COPY."  The computer spoke back.  "Require
access code?"  Mechtail look at the keyboard, and thought for a minute.
"Hmm.... Oh yes I remember now."  'TAP, TAP, TAP, TAP'  "Access granted."
*/It's a good thing they haven't changed it yet.\*  The computer printed out
a very big map.  He looked it over there was still allot of unmarked spots on 
in.  "Hmmm must be allot of rough terrain."  Mechtail folded the map the best 
he could and shoved into his jacket.  He then ran out of the hover craft and 
stopped a distance away.  He then turned around, then looked at his hands 
and consecrated.  His eyes started glowing again as he lifted his hands and 
aimed them at the craft.  A burst of energy engulfed it, the hover craft 
exploded.  Mechtail smiled as he turned around and walked back into the 
great forest.  "LOOK OUT PAC MAN I'M BACK!"

The End.

At what time and in what satellite tv channel does the sonic show airs. I 
look for it in T1/21 and there was nothing at 7 am. I heard that the show 
was cancelled, is that true? if not could you tell me where I can find 
the feed?

	Who says you can't make hot dogs out of fish?  All the hot dogs
that Sonic scarfs down could be made of ground fish meal, flavored to taste
like beef.

	Or are the fish of Mobius non-sentient?  I know the dolphins, 
walses and some others are sentient, but what about the common fish?  
(like, say, the tuna fish?)  That could be where all the meat is coming from.
(Interesting thought, here.)

	Anybody else got any ideas about this?

	Ed Becerra


	P.S.  Anybody read my "Visions in the Wind" yet?  Looking for 
some feedback.

	Who would want to like on a ball of radioactive mud?  I've seen 
the results you get, trying something like that.  [MILITARY CLASSIFIED 
MATERIAL CENSORED HERE]  I don't think even Robotnik is _THAT_ stupid.

	Yeah, I'll buy this.  But when you mass an army of mechs, you got 
a support and supply problem that just won't quit.  Believe me, I've seen 
that as well. [MORE MILITARY CENSORSHIP HERE]

	Uhhh, sorry about the censorship, folks.  It isn't a joke.  There 
are _still_ a few things I'm not supposed to talk about, now that I'm out 
of the military.

	Anyway, Robotnik, Snivley & Co. seem to have a fair regard for 
their own skin.  Otherwise, they'd have started in on some of the more 
_exotic_ methods of warefare know to exist.  Nukes, chemicals, 
bio-warfare (ugh!), kinetic energy weapons, you name it.  Biowarfare 
would seem especially useful when you're fighting a different race 
altogether!  After all, any biologist/genetic engineer worth his salt 
would find it dead easy to come up with a new disease that avoided 
humans, but struck down other animals.  There are plenty of 
species-specific  plagues out there.  

	The problem with this, is that you get into the whole total war 
concept.  Dangerous.  Gets people _REALLY_ pissed.  Just ask the Nazi's.
Even _they_ were afraid of trying this for fear of retaliation.  It's all 
too easy to get out of control on _both_ sides.  Result?

	One _dead_ and _sterile_ planet.  No good to either side.  
(that's assuming anyone's still left alive to be called the winner!)

	Trust me.  This is something I'm _ALL_ too familiar with.  You 
_really_ don't want my nightmares, folks.

	So I have to say that barring Robotnik/Snivley losing it 
completely, such weapons will likely remain unused.  

	(Can you say `Balance of Terror', children?  Good.  I knew you could.)
 

	Guess that's all for now.

	Thanks for listening....

	Fortuna bless and keep you.....

Ed,

Pretty serious post there.  

You're my kind of fan!

You have to figure someone like Robotnik has enough gray matter, however
corrupt, to avoid any long-term mass destruction.  Then again, he also
seems like the kind of guy who, with his back to the wall, just might
torch an entire planet out of spite.  For as long as the show ran (and
the comic runs), the two sides seem to be holding each other in check.

To flip the strategic question, the byword for Knothole operations seems
to be "surgical precision."  OK, that's two words, but you get my drift.
Sally doesn't seem to go in for the Massive Assault(tm) when strategic
crippling of Robotnik's infrastructure will do just as well.

What would happen if that were to ever change?  Kanterovich & Penders
hinted at it in the beginning of "Night Of A Thousand Sonics" [Sonic
#19].  The alternative Mobius described by the Borg Sonic (with more
than a faint bow to the Terminator movies) would require a bit more
firepower and a bit more crank on the part of the resistance.  On THAT
Mobius, I could picture "Life During Wartime" by Talking Heads as part
of the soundtrack.

Just my $.02:

Hi there pals!
I was watching the childish Sonic tv series and I discovered on a chapter
that there is a cow.So Sonic eats beef meat on the chili-dogs.If you check
the chapter Momma Robotnik returns you will see a cow on the beginning.Well
this is my stupid answer.

Bye!

The following stories are now available on my web page and in Ratman's 
FTP site:

By Ryan Huber:		The Other Side
By Pat Carson:		Seeing Stars
By Joseph DeLaCroix:	Awakenings
By Don Weatherwax:	Tail
By Thaddeus Boyd:	The Hunt
By Robert Haynie:	Other Sonics

FANFIC FACT (try saying that 3x fast): Every now and again you see 
Bookshire or Rotor or somebody using Cryptosmasher software.  I was the 
first author to use it and others have followed.  So where did I get the 
idea?  From the John Hughes Movie 'Weird Science'.  In it, the two guys 
use Cryptosmasher to break into a company mainframe.


Keep reading and long live Sonic the Hedgehog!

Subject: Great Unknown Too boring to explore.
Sender: owner-sonic@bort.mv.net

Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

Hiya all,

Another mystery..

Why hasn't the great unknown been explored?=20

* They had space age technology before the take over.
* They'd been around with high technology for a good while.(+500 years at=
 least)

My guesses are these:

In the one story of "Postcards from Mobius", Dulcy exclaims that the Great
Unknown was extremely boring and that was probably why it had never been
explored. It's a possibility..

Perhaps the war kept anyone from going out into the great unknown. (The
danger of being blown to little floating pieces of carbon) Of course, before
the war, there might have been the danger of ending up as a dragons snack.
(Dragons as they would be the best equipted for moving in/over the area)

Perhaps the are is avoided because of Myths? Yes, even with all their
technology, they seem to have some religion or something that keeps them
happy. (Look at 'Garden City', and remember that it's level N technology..
then look at Robotropolis.. and know that that's also level N.) So, perhaps
the same religon/morals/ideals that kept home tidy, kept them out of the
Unknown.

-----
Just a quick tip: If you want the Sonic intro avi to start up every time you
run Windows, edit win.ini and in the 'run=3D' part towards the top of the=
 file
put the path and name of the AVI. For example:
run =3Dc:\avi\sonintro.avi
If you want it full screen, then from mediaplayer.. load an avi and select
Configure. Select 2X, select Fullscreen. Then click -- Set Default
<ADVERT> Check my home page.

Cheers :)

	Good points, but it could also be that 'The Great Unknown' is just a 
name and it could have been explored before. (mabye the records were lost????)
	Also, some weird thing that could only be explained in a Sci-Fi show 
blocks all forms of exploration equipment.

Visions in the Wind: Transitions

by Ed Becerra
-----------------------------------

   Kickaha woke with a start.  *Whaaa..., Oh!  I must have fallen asleep in
Davey's chair.  I never realized what a blessing it would be to have the
pain taken from me.  I've got to find some way to thank Sonia Hedgehog.
I've lived with this stupid back for so long, I'd forgotten what life was
like without the pain.  I owe her a lot.  Hmm...  Gotta think of something
nice to do for her.*

   He reached down for his cane.  "I <hack, hack> should take a walk and
stretch, before I get stiff again.  Besides, I wanna see what Knothole looks
like.  Seems like a pretty place.  I should get to know it better.  If Old
Man is right, I'm going to be here for some time.  Guess it's going to be my
home, for a while."

   He walked out the door, carefully shutting it behind him.  *I'm Davey's
guest.  Behoves me to be thoughtful.*

   The late day sun shone brightly, reminding Kickaha of his native prairie.
He felt a little homesick.  All those trees, so close together!  And the
grass.  It was green, not the proper brown buffalo grass of home.  Nor was
it nearly tall enough.  He looked around.  Not a yucca plant or prickly pear
cactus to be seen.  He sighed.

   "This had better be worth it, Old Man.  You know I don't belong here.
Ain't natural.  I belong to the Rockies and the Plains.  Coyotes just ain't
made for civilization."

   He wandered around Knothole, greeting the inhabitants, and learning the
village layout.  As he drifted through the streets, he happened to pass by
Princess Sally's place.

   "Hello, Kickaha!"

   "Oh, hello, Princess!  I didn't see you there.  Is there anything I can
do for you?" Kickaha asked.

   "Not right now.  But there IS something we can do for you.  We're getting
together some volunteers to put up a hut for you.  I know you're having
trouble with your back right now, so you don't have to join in, if you don't
want to." Sally smiled at him.  But she didn't get the response she
expected.  Kickaha was shaking his head frantically.

   "Aahhhh...  No, no, no thank you, Princess.  Don't put yourself out.
I'll find someplace in the forest to den up in.  Don't trouble yourself.  No
problem.  Don't really need a hut.  Everything's okay.  Really.  Yeah.
Don't need a hut..." All of this was coming out at a high-speed babble that
surprised Sally.  Kickaha was backing away from her as though he'd just seen
Robotnik rise from the grave.  Suddenly, he turned and ran.  She could see
from his awkward stride how it hurt him to run that quickly.  But why was he
running?  And from what?

   She watched as he stopped just inside the edge of the forest, and leaned
against a tree, propped up by his cane, panting.  Something was wrong here,
she thought.  But what?  It didn't seem like a case of Outsider mood.  At
least, not one she was familiar with.  He seemed...  afraid.  But of a hut?
She turned to look for Nicole.  Perhaps the computer might have the answers
she needed.

                                 ***
   
   At the edge of the forest...

   "A-huh, a-huh, a-huh..." panted Kickaha.  *Oh, yeah* he thought, *behave
like some savage from the wilderness.  Smooth move, stupid.* He shuddered,
and sat down suddenly at the base of the tree.  *Oh, Fortuna, I didn't think
it would hit me that quickly!  What am I going to do?  What am I going to
tell them?  That I _can't_ live inside Knothole?  They'll think me
ungrateful.  Or even a spy for Snively.  I don't know what to do!  Help me,
Great Spirit!*

   His breathing eased, and his panic subsided, but his worry remained.

                                 ***
     
   At Princess Sally's hut...

   A cute girl bobcat was speaking with Sally.

   "There's not a great deal in the database about the Wild Pack tribes,
Princess, and what is there dates from before the Great War and Robotnik's
coup.  What I have found does seem to answer your question, however.  You
said he seemed to panic when you mentioned putting up a hut for him?"

   "That's right," answered Sally.  "Until then, he seemed all right.  But
when I brought up the matter of the hut, he began to shiver, then ran into
the forest.  He stopped running once he reached the edge, though.  The last
I saw of him, he was sitting beneath a tree, shaking violently."

   "... Demophobia ..." said Nicole.

   "What's that?"

   "An unreasoning fear of being surrounded by crowds of people.  It seems
that the coyote tribes share a great deal with their unevolved kin.  Like
them, the coyote people form loose, widely spread family groups, with only a
few in each pack.  They prefer to live underground, in burrows dug into the
sides of small hills.  And they feel extremely uncomfortable when surrounded
by large numbers of people.  In many cases, as time passes, this feeling
becomes demophobia.  In fact, many coyotes become hermits." Nicole blinked.
"From your description, Princess, I'd say he's having an unusually strong
reaction to the number of people living in Knothole."

   "Is there anything we can do to help him?" asked Sally.

   "Well, moving him as close as possible to the edge of the village would
help.  The fewer the people near to him, the better.  And we should try to
make him feel at home.  The unfamiliar setting of Knothole is probably what
triggered his panic attack.  The Great Forest looks nothing like the High
Prairies that were his home.  There is very little here that would seem
familiar to him." Nicole told her.

   "Familiar settings.  Hmm...  Nicole, you wouldn't happen to have any
pictures of what a typical coyote burrow looks like?  Or any descriptions 
of them?"

   "Checking...  There are several descriptions, and a few sketches of a
traditional coyote lodge that were made by a researcher from the University
of Mobotropolis before the Great War.  The paper he wrote contains them,
along with brief descriptions of how it was furnished and what living in one
was like." Nicole looked at Sally.  "They are somewhat dated.  But they are
the best I can come up with."

   "Good.  They'll do.  Print out several copies.  I've got to go speak with
Rotor.  I think I have a solution to this." Sally turned and headed to
Rotor's workshop.  "When you've got the copies made, bring them to me.  I'll
be at Rotor's place.  And see if Dulcy's available.  I'd like to talk with
her."

                                 ***

   An hour later, a nervous coyote wandered back into Knothole, headed for
Davey Crockett's hut.

   *Maybe if I get a good night's sleep, I can deal with this.  But I really
dread the thought of having to explain things to Princess Sally.  She's
gonna think I'm the most ungrateful cur since...  since...  Fortuna!  I
can't _think_ of anyone that ungrateful!*

   As he walked toward the hut, Bear caught up with him.  "Hey there,
Kickaha!  How are you?  Feeling any better?  Sally said you were having a
few problems settling in.  Nothing serious, I hope."

   "Uh..  Yeah..  Right..  Nothing serious.  Just a little nervous, a new
setting, far away from home, all that stuff.  Yeah.  That's it.  No big
deal." Kickaha chattered.

   Bear could see how nervous the coyote seemed.  Maybe...  Yes.  He touched
the coyote on the shoulder.  "Don't worry about it.  Besides, I hear
Princess Sally has something she wants to show you tomorrow morning.  I
understand that your folk are nocturnal, so you might want to get some rest.
Sunrise comes pretty early in the morning around here."

   "All right.  You're right.  I need sleep.  Yeah.  That's the ticket.
Sleep.  Good idea.  Good night." Despite his fur and the warmth of the
evening, Kickaha was shivering.  He went inside the hut and went straight to
bed.

   Bear turned toward his own hut.  *He's having a hard time with this.  If
there ever was a born hermit, he's one.  I hope Sally's idea works.
Otherwise, his only hope is to live out in the forest, like Sandra
Nightweaver.*

                                 ***

   As the morning sun shone through the windows of Davey's hut, it lit up
the cot Kickaha lay upon.  The coyote wasn't sleeping easily.  He was
twitching and growling in his sleep.  Every now and then, he let out a small
snarl.  Davey noticed this, but thought it best to leave him be for the
moment.

   *I'll just let him sleep for now.  If he doesn't wake up before breakfast
is over, then I'll get him up myself.  I wouldn't want him to miss Sally's
surprise.*

   After eating, Davey headed back to his hut, carrying a tray of food for
Kickaha.  He set it down on a table, and looked over at the cot.  He was
still asleep, and still dreaming.  Davey went to shake him by the shoulder.
To his surprise, he was almost bitten for his trouble.  Kickaha snarled and
snapped at him without even opening his eyes.

   "RAAAGGGHHH!!  YOU BAST...  Oh, Fortuna!  Oh, David!  I'm sorry!  So
sorry!  I thought...  I didn't realize...  oh, crud." Kickaha put a paw to
his head.  He had a mortified expression on his face.  "Ah, gods, I'm so
sorry."

   "Bad dreams, huh?  Ah been there myself, once or twice.  Must be pretty
bad if you wake up in a kill-without-warning kinda mood.  Wanna talk about
it sometime?  It can help, to have a friend to share the load." Davey smiled
at him.  "I've had good friends here help me get through my problems.  They
can help you, too."

   "I don't know if I have that right, David.  I don't want to lay my guilt
on anyone.  No one deserves that." Kickaha was silent for a moment.  A look
of ancient sorrow crossed his face.  "No one but me."

   "Hey now, Kicker!  Ah thought I was the one carrying around all the blame
around here.  After all, Sally's been constantly telling me nobody blames me
for being a Kintobor.  Quit tryin' ta hog all the guilt, guy." Davey put a
paw on Kickaha's shoulder.  "These are good folk, here.  They'll help you if
you let them.  Now eat some breakfast.  I got a surprise to show you when
you're done."

   "What's that?  A hut?" Kickaha started to shiver slightly.  "I don't need
a hut, I really don't, I can live out in the forest..." He'd begun to
chatter again.

   "Naw, no hut.  Something different.  It wouldn't be a surprise if I told
what it was, now would it?  You just eat up.  Don't want to keep Princess
Sally waiting, do ya?" David pushed him over to the table and sat him down
in front of the breakfast tray.  "Besides, Nicole told us 'bout your
`problem'.  Seems it's a coyote kind of thing.  Don't worry about it.  We
can handle it together.  Now EAT, already!"

                                 ***
                                 
   Breakfast had been finished, and Kickaha and David were walking toward
the Power Ring Pool.  Kickaha was becoming more curious by the second.  As
they'd walked, he noted that Knothole seemed rather quiet.  He hadn't seen
anyone in the streets.  Something was going on, but what?

   When they reached the pool, David turned off towards a small trail that
led off through the underbrush on the far side of the small pool.  "Come on,
Kicker.  It's this way."

   "What's this way?!  Come on, Dave!  If you leave me hanging like this for
much longer, I swear I'm gonna sneak up on you tonight and super-glue your
mechanical arm to your cot!  I KNOW where you live.  I KNOW where you sleep.
AND I know where I can get a few thousand Nerf bricks, real cheap!" Kickaha
threatened.  Davey laughed at that.

   Kickaha wasn't feeling as nasty as he sounded, though.  The further they
got into the forest around Knothole, the better he felt.  He knew why, too.
*It may not be the High Prairie, but at least there aren't many people here.
It's quiet and lonely, just like home.* Something deep inside him unknotted
and relaxed.  He let out a deep sigh of contentment.

   "Almost there, Kick." Davey was a few feet ahead of him, and the cyberfox
was a foot or so taller than he was, to begin with.  Kickaha couldn't see
past him.  And jumping up to see over him seemed a little undignified.

   "Here we are!  Take a good look, Kicker.  Tell us what you think!" Davey
had an ear to ear grin.  (Which is something to see on a fox.)

   They'd just come upon a small clearing.  From the looks of it, a large
tree had fallen, years ago, and knocked down a number of others.  Running
along side of the clearing's edge was a tiny stream.  Near the center stood
Sally, Rotor, Bookshire, Dulcy and a number of others.  they were standing
next to what seemed to be a large hole in the ground.  There was a large
pile of cut sod nearby.

   Kickaha could hear Rotor saying, "No, no, the fire pit goes in the center
of the Great Room, not to the side.  The sleeping cabinets are what go on
the sides.  And remember to lay the granite tiles in the fire pit, first."

   Kickaha's jaw dropped.  He couldn't believe what he was seeing.  He
walked forward.  It was real.  "Whaaa...  How...  Why...  This...  this
looks just like the lodge of Three Young Buffalo.  How did you...?"

   Sally laughed.  "Nicole told us what the trouble was, and she had
pictures of the sort of home you were used to living in.  All we had to do
was find a small clearing on the edge of the village.  Tails had seen this
one from the air, and Sonic checked it out.  Near enough to be safe, and far
enough away for a coyote."

   Rotor turned toward him.  "We don't have enough sod to cover the entire
burrow, but the mages all say that a spell to make grass seed grow fast is
an easy thing to do.  It'll be ready to live in by the day after tommorrow.
Within the week, it will look just like the pictures Nicole found.  Two
weeks from now, you won't be able to tell it from any other small grassy
hill."

   "I..  I..  I don't know what to say.  I don't know how I can repay
you..."

   "Just do what you can to help overthrow Robotropolis and further the
cause of freedom, Kickaha.  That's all anyone needs to do." Sally told him.
"Oh, don't forget to schedule an appointment with Sir Charles.  You need to
take care of that back.  Remember what I said about people who wouldn't
listen to good advice?" With that, she shot Davey another one of her
_looks_.  He flinched, and held up both paws.

   "I'll be good, Sally, honest I will!" Davey whined.  "I promise!"

   Sally humphed.  "You'd better.  Or I'll set Sonia on you.  And you know
_SHE_ won't take any excuses from you." At that, Davey went white under his
fur.

   Now it was Kickaha's turn to laugh.  "Looks like she's got you by the
shorts, good buddy.  I'd advise a quick surrender before it's too late.
After all, you know females never take prisoners.  I thought you knew that."
He snickered uncontrollably.  "The girls are _always_ more dangerous than
the guys.  Ah learned that a looong time ago.  Hey, come on, let's go see if
they can use any help putting my lodge together."

   And with that, David and Kickaha trooped over to lend a hand.

Visions in the Wind: Friends Well Met.

by Ed Becerra

-----------------------------------

   Somewhere between Robotopolis and the Great Forest...

   "Aaargh!  I gotta take a rest.  If I don't, I swear my spine's gonna jump
right outta my body and beat me to death, just to put an end to the back
pain." muttered Edward Coyote.  "I don't care how badly Old Man wants to
talk to this Davey Crockett guy.  I can't do the job, if I can't bloody
_walk_, now can I?  And if he's got any complaints, well, they can just wait
'til AFTER I rest."

   He spotted a clump of trees a short distance away.

   "Yeah, that's the ticket.  Cover, concealment, and some shade.  Just what
I need.  Now if I can just get there without falling on my face..."

   A few minutes later, Kickaha had reached the small patch of trees, and
had found a mid-sized one to rest underneath.  He shed his pack, and laid
the shotgun he'd jacked from the SWATbot down beside it.  Holding tightly to
his ironwood cane, he carefully eased himself down to the ground.

   He leaned back against the trunk.  "Aaaahhhhh!  That's... good, soooo...
good.  Yeah.  That helps.  That helps _a lot_!" He let out a sigh.  "I'll
just rest here for a little bit." he said tiredly.  "Just a few minutes,
that's all.  I'll just sit here a few minutes, only a few.  No more than
that.  Just a few minutes."

   A little while later...

   Small non-sentient animals were running in sheer terror from the hideous
sounds coming from the nearby trees.  Birds and winged insects were flying
for their lives.  Even the plants were doing their best to cringe in pain.
Was Packbell torturing a Freedom Fighter?  Was some poor innocent caught in
one of Snivley's death traps?  What horrible thing had happened under the
trees?

   Kickaha had fallen asleep.  All of his tribe, indeed, most of the Wild
Pack had told him that he snored.  Loudly.  Badly.  In tones that could bend
metal and shatter glass.  He refused to believe them.  Now he was asleep and
snoring again.  Too bad for the poor creatures around him.


   Some hours later...

   The sizzling lightning-bolt whipcracks of electro-magnetic pulse blasts
echoing through the trees woke Kickaha from his slumber.  He spared no time
in blaming himself for falling asleep.  There were more important things at
hand, right now.

   "Gunfire?!  Combat?!  Somebody threw a firefight and forgot to invite
me?!!  I am seriously _TICKED OFF_!  How DARE they have a battle and not
include me?!  Aaaarrgh!  SOMEONE WILL PAY FOR THIS!" Edward was _not_
amused.  He'd missed out on too many fights, already.

   He grabbed his pack, then hefted his shotgun and checked it's status.
*Full magazine, round in the chamber, safety off.  Right, then.  Time to 
see just what the FUBAR is goin' on here!*

   He hobbled quickly towards the sounds of battle.  "If it's them damn
Swats again, I am definitely gonna get me a cycle _this_ time." he growled.
"I AM SICK AND TIRED OF WALKING!!  AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!"

   A few moments later, he'd reached a small clearing, where he was able to
get a good look at what was going on.  From where he stood, it looked like a
band of Freedom Fighters were beating the living crud out of one of
Robotnik's Hover Bots.  And Kickaha was missing out on all the fun.  Damn.

   By this time, a hovercycle had somehow moored itself to the side of the
Hover Bot.  Ed heard two shots fired from a weapon he was unfamiliar with,
and then watched as a number of rebels boarded the Hover Bot and stripped it
of the supplies it was carrying.

   *Hey!* thought Kickaha.  *Maybe this group can tell me where I can find
Princess Sally and her village.  After all, I can't wander around aimlessly
like this forever.  If I can just catch up with them, or even follow them
back to their base, that'll solve a lot of problems.  Even if they can't
help me, I can still use fresh supplies, a little R & R, and a few nights in
a place with indoor plumbing!*

   About then, he noticed that the rebels had abandoned the Hover Bot, and
caught sight of a tall fox leaping aboard the cycle and high-tailing it hell
for leather.  The Hover Bot then destroyed itself in an example of
pyro-technic Chain-Reaction-Ultra-Destruction that warmed Kickaha's heart.

   *Beauty!  Wonder what explosive they used?  And where I can score some
for myself.  I haven't set a good booby-trap in ages.  I start feeling a
little cranky when I haven't blown something up recently... Hey!  What in
the name of the Great Spirit is THAT?!*

   THAT, as Kickaha put it, was a shooting star, and a peculiar looking one
at that.  First, it was glowing bright green!  Second, it _wasn't_ burning
up in the atmosphere, like most shooting stars.  And finally, it was going
to hit in this general area... in about... 15 SECONDS?!

   *AAAAHHHHH!!!!  RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!*
     
   Meanwhile, the fox on the Hovercycle was going one on one with a pack of
Swats.  It hadn't noticed the eerie green glow coming from the strange
shooting star.  It was yelling at the top of it's voice, "RRRRRRAAAAAAAA!"
The fox, a Swatbot, and the star all met at the same spot.

   "Ouch!" said Ed.  *He's gonna feel _that_ in the morning!* he thought.

   Then the blast wave caught Kickaha, as well.  He had time enough for one
last thought, before it blew him into the trees.

   *Bet _this_ is gonna leave a mark!*

***********************************

   "Hey!  Princess!  Dere's somebody over 'ere!  An' it looks like 'e got
clocked real good!  Hey, you dere!  You okay?"

   "... unnhhh ..."

   The other rebels had left the tavern that had caught the fox who'd been
riding the now-wrecked hovercycle.  They headed over to where Speed had
apparently found another casualty of the battle.

   The purple hedgehog shook the shoulders of the middle-aged coyote she'd
found sprawled unconscious beneath a nearby tree.  "Hey, you!  Ennybody in
dere?  Wake up, awready!  Da fight's over."

   ".... nO mOrE puLquE fOr mE, tHaNkS.  i'M dRiViNg ...."
     
   By this time Princess Sally was standing beside them.  Since it didn't
look like the coyote was going to regain his senses anytime soon, she gave
orders to have him taken back with them to Knothole, after being thoroughly
searched for hidden transmitters that could lead Snivley to the hidden
village.

   They gathered up his belongings, and as they did, Ryan noted that the
coyote was carrying a shotgun taken from a SWATbot.

   "Hey, Davey, scope this!" Ryan held up the shotgun.  "Do you think he's
working for Snively?"

   "Not unless he's _really_ stupid.  I don't think there's anyone on Mobius
that trusts Snively as far as they can throw him.  Not even Packbell.
Especially not Packbell."

   "Good point!  Heh-heh.  Snively's a butthead!  Heh-heh."

   "No, I'm Butthead, you're Bevis.  Snively's the idiot.  Huh-huh-huh.  I
made a joke.  Jokes are cool.  Huh-huh-huh." Davey snickered, rubbing a sore
neck from the fall.

   Elizabeth Raccoon rolled her eyes.  "Oil all over the place, and now bad
jokes.  So mature.  NOT!"

   They loaded the injured coyote aboard the transport they'd brought to
carry the supplies, and headed back for Knothole.

***********************************

   Davey was riding back to Knothole in the transport with their unexpected
guest.  Sally had insisted, after the spill he'd taken.  He looked at the
semi-conscious passenger curiously.  He'd seen plenty of other Mobians, but
never a coyote before.

   "Princess, I don't recall seeing any coyotes among the Freedom Fighters.
Why is that?"

   Sally looked back at him.  "They don't seem to mix much, and those few
who were around Mobotropolis before the coup were pretty quiet, as a rule.
They didn't talk much, and tended to stick with their own tribes, out near
the Rocky Mountains and the High Prairie.  That's some distance from here.
It's a bit surprising to see one of them this far away from their native
lands."

   "Hmmm...  You don't say." There was something vaguely familiar about this
coyote to Davey.  But he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

   *Well, I can always find out later, when we get back.* he thought.  *If
it's important, I'll remember it, eventually.*

   "... uuhhhgg ... did anybody get... the licence plate... of that
SWATbot... uunnnhh..." This from the coyote, who seemed to be coming
around.  He looked a little confused.

   Davey spoke to him, calmingly.  "You're going to be O.K.  Everthing's all
right.  You just took a bit of a blow back there."

   "oooohhhh.... man, what a head I've got.  Excedrin headache Number
3.1415927.  Anybody... uggh... got an aspirin?"

   "Do you know who you are?  Do you remember your name?" asked Sally, who
was worried about possible head injuries.

   "Kickaha.  Edward Anthony Coyote.  I think.  Tell the guy with the
jackhammer to lay off my head, willya?  Ow!  And who are you?  Where am I?
Last thing I remember, I was in the forest watching some rebels stomp a
Hover Bot flat." he groaned.

   "That was us.  We found you unconscious under a tree.  It looked like the
explosion slammed you into a trunk and knocked you out." she said.

   "Figures.  Just my luck.  Say, can you folks help me?  I used to be a
rebel, a long time ago.  I'm looking for Princess Sally and her Freedom
Fighters, and a fox named Davey Crockett.  Would you know where they are, 
or how I can get in touch with them?"

   Princess Sally looked a little startled.  "I think we need to have a
talk, Kickaha."

   He looked around at them.  "Oh, no!" he moaned.  "Don't tell me.  Lemme
guess." He pointed at her.  "You're Princess Sally." He turned to look at
Davey.  "And you're David Kintobor, aka Davey Crockett." He buried his face
in his paws.  "Old Man, you done it to me again.  Ah'm gonna get you fer
this one."

   He began to rise, then collapsed to the floor in a heap.  Davey and Sally
started towards him, worry written on their faces.

   "No!  Don't!  It's just my back.  I had an old injury, and I've been
walking for weeks, making it worse.  I'll be okay.  Just... don't move me,
please?  That'll make it worse."

   "All right.  But when we get to Knothole, you're going straight to the
infirmary.  Don't try and fight me on this." Sally's expression was stern.
"I've had enough trouble from people who won't listen to good advice." She
gave Davey a _look_.  "I don't need another one on my hands."

   "... owch ... you're getting no complaints from me, Princess.  I'm ...
aahh ...  in no position to complain.  Heh.  Just don't move me 'till we get
there.  Please?"

**********************************

   In the infirmary...

   Two cots were side by side.  Davey was sitting on one, with Kickaha lying
on the other.  They'd had to bring him in on a stretcher.  He looked like a
pretzel, he was so twisted.

   Davey was feeling curious, and wanted to take Ed's mind off his problem,
so he thought he'd ask him a few questions

   "So, Kickaha--that's the name?--how'd you become a Freedom Fighter?"

   "Early in your father's coup.  I happened to be around Mobotropolis when
it started, so I became one of the early rebels.  I didn't last long though.
.."

Flashback:

   Inside an armored mortar carrier, first year of the coup.  Kickaha's
trying to repair a balky swivel plate on the mortar.

   "Hey Obie!  Pass the toolbox an' the baseplate over here, Please?"

   "Sure thing, Kickaha."

   With a _kick_, the toolbox was sent *flying* into the carrier.

   "Ow!!  Hey!!"

   The baseplate, a round flat piece of steel shaped like a thick manhole
cover, came next.

   "AAAAAAAAAA!!"

   It landed on top of Ed.

   CRUNCH!

   "uuuuuh. . . my hero . . . pele . . . "

End Flashback:

   "Lucky me, my back didn't break.  It went bad nonetheless.  Got weak legs
and a bad case of Rheumatism as well, thanks to Mr.  World Cup champ!  I got
a medical discharge and returned to my Wild Pack tribe."

   "Wild Pack, you say." Davey said as he listened.  Scoping the coyote at
the infirmary cot next to him, he saw the stuff Kickaha brought with him--a
Dream Catcher, a ceremonial pipe, various amulets and a medicine bag on a
necklace--that reminded Davey of a race of people he calls 'Native
Americans.' This 'Wild Pack' must be Mobius' answer to that culture, or so
Davey surmised.  "How'd you been going all this time?"

   "Oh, I lived day by day, following the wind, listening to the spirits,
Wild Pack stuff." Kickaha smirked at Davey.  "I don't know if you'd be
interested." *Gotcha!  But I gotta be careful he doesn't slip the hook.  Old
Man 'll have my hide for his headdress if I blow this one.*

   "I could.  Your culture reminds me of a similar culture from my planet.
I had a book of their stories that I really loved as a kid."

   Right about then a tall, good looking cyber-hedgehog entered the room.
She headed straight for Davey.

   "Davey!  How ya doing?" She hugged and kissed the tall fox.  "Speed told
me all about that Chaos Emerald that almost nailed ya."

   "Huh?  I mean, Excuse me?" Kickaha was a little puzzled.  "What Chaos
Emerald?"

   Kickaha then got the instant replay of what things had looked like from
Davey's point of view, courtesy of Davey's holo-projector.  While this took
place, Suni examined her man.  Except for a slight case of whiplash that she
quickly healed, Davey was unharmed.

   "Wow!  All that happened around you and you walked without a scratch?!?
Looks like some of our spirits are starting to like you!" Kickaha laughed.
*Damn, you work fast, Old Man!  Or was that even you?  I'd better check.*

   "You ask me, I'd say it's just the worst case of Bad Karma on two
planets." said Davey in pessimistic tones.

   While Suni worked on her man, Kickaha took a closer look at Davey.  *By
the Great Horn Spoon!  I haven't see an aura like that for some time.  You
were right, Old Man, he _is_ one of us.  And _very_ powerful.  This could
present some problems.  I've got to think on this.*

   He quirked an eyebrow at David from the cot.  "What Bad Karma?  The Bad
Karma you got from your Daddy?  I beg to differ, my friend."

   Princess Sally entered the infirmary right then.  She didn't look at all
happy with Davey.

   "As do I.  I'm going to keep repeating this; I ordered all of Knothole to
repeat it, until it gets into that thick stubborn head of yours." She got in
Davey's face, grabbed him by the ears, and raised her voice.  "You are not
to answer for the crimes of your father, David Jim Kintobor.  Not by us, not
by our gods, and not by your own damn guilty conscious.  Not if I can help
it!  I'd bop you on that thick head of yours with a very large hammer to
give you amnesia, but Suni would kill me if I did, so I have to shout it
into that thick head of yours and let it rattle in what you use for a brain
every now and then until it finally sticks!" She let go of him, then.
"Besides, we've gotta talk about what Julian found.  Is he going to be fine,
Suni, as least, relatively?"

   "He's gonna be fine.  You don't have to worry about Davey's inner
demons." She hugged Davey and stroked his pelt.  "I'll take care of them.
You go now, Hon."

   Kickaha was thinking, *Better not push it right now.  Besides, looks like
the Healer, what was her name?  Oh, yeah.  Sonia.  Looks like I'm next on
her list.*

   He waved as Davey left the room.  "We'll continue this later ..."

***********************************

   "I don't know how much I can do for you, Edward.  Your injuries are so
old, so much a part of you, your body's accepted them as what's natural for
you.  But I can ease the pain somewhat, and reduce the swelling." Sonia
frowned.  She didn't like being unable to help a patient.

   "Don't distress yourself, lass.  I accepted my lot a long time ago.  And
easing the pain is a blessing." He smiled at her.  "Just do your best, and
you'll have nothing to feel sorry for.  And please, call me Kickaha."

   *The spirits are strong with this one.  Mother Earth is a force within
her.  Well, she IS a healer.  But I sense _fire_, as well!  She bears
watching.*

   "But there may be _another_ way, Ed..  urr..  Kickaha."

   "Eh?  What might that be?"

   Sonia explained the modifications King Acorn and David had made to Sir
Charles's Roboticizer.

   "Hmmm.  Sounds like just the ticket.  I'll look into it.  Thank you."

***********************************

   After being treated by Sonia, Kickaha was moved into Davey's hut, until
Knothole could build him one of his own.  He was mobile again, with the help
of his cane, and went looking for Davey.  He found him gathering together a
raiding party.

   "I'd love to join in, but I don't think I'd do you any good right now.
At the moment, a stunned snail could outrace me.  I've heard of this more
original design of Chuck's prized machine you've perfected, Dave, and I feel
that it'll do me good.  Can't wait to be a Borg." Ed chuckled.  "Go Borg
them one for me!"

   Davey flicked his fingers on the brim of his cap.  "Will do, Kickaha."
Then he headed off for Robotroplis.

   Ed returned to the hut to rest.  As he entered, he heard the soft brush
of feathers behind him.  He turned to look over his shoulder and saw a large
black crow on Davey's windowsill.

   "So, Old Man.  Think Davey's got potential?"

   "I dunno," the crow answered.  "You told him about me yet?"

   "Not yet.  He said that he's interested in some stories about you,
though."

   "Good.  Let me meet him first, Kickaha.  And then, when he's curious,
he'll come to you.  Let him know then." The crow spread his wings and took
flight, following David.

   He watched as the crow landed on Dave's shoulder, then turned to find a
soft chair to rest in.  He moved it so he could look out at Knothole as he
sat.  He started to laugh.

   "I wonder if Knothole knows what it's gotten itself into now?  Well, Old
Man, you _did_ keep your word to me.  Life's been a lot of things since you
walked into mine, all those years ago, but it's never been _dull_!!"

   He laughed softly for some time, then quietly fell asleep in the chair.
His dreams were...  interesting.

Nothing worth saying, IMHO :^|  It'll be interesting to see Dan's flame, 
er, review of it...  Here are my comments:  (spoiler warning)

The cover is the most interesting part of the whole issue, IMHO...

Story art by Manak and Harvo; enough said...

The story is clearly geared for the kiddies and others who can suspend 
belief enough to accept anthropomorphic germs and antibodies.  Not much 
more to say about it...

The never-ending Knuckles story: another mystery figure joins the "plot"...

The hockey game with Snively: barely the best of the issue, but you'd think 
the FFers would've realized Robotnik wouldn't honor his bet if he lost, 
thus why take the risk of _them_ losing?  (It wasn't clear that they had no 
choice...)  And Snively seemed out of character from the show...

At least Dan will be happy there's no office humor (but no letters page 
either) in this issue; instead, it was replaced with the annual legal 
hooey, which is actually rather interesting once you learn how to read it 
(or scary, if I read it right - comments from insider Paul Castiglia would 
be appreciated):

"average" in the following is for the preceding 12 months, 
"actual" is the issue published nearest to the filing date:

15A: Total No. Copies:  			Ave.: 202902, actual: 196690
15B: Paid and/or requested circulation:
     1.  Sales through dealers and carriers, 
         street vendors and counter sales:    	Ave.:  57996, actual:  65080
     2.  Paid or requested mail subscriptions:  ave.:   5671, actual:   5516 
15C: Total paid and/or requested circulation:   ave.:  63667, actual:  70596 
15D: Free distribution by mail; samples, 
     complimentary, and other free: 		ave.:    468, actual:    542 
15F: Total distribution: 			ave.:  64135, actual:  71138
15G: Total not distributed: 
     1.  office use, leftovers, spoiled: 	ave.:   7898, actual:   7862 
     2.  Returns from news agents: 		ave.: 130869, actual: 117690 
15I: Total: 					ave.: 202902, actual: 196690 
     Percent paid and/or requested circulation: ave.:  99.3%, actual:  99.3%

My question to Paul is the following: is over a two-thirds return rate 
normal and/or acceptable, or is this bad news for Sonic?

The lead story tonight, "Lets Get Small" is a Gallagher and Manak
combo.  Well lets say it's not one of those stories you'll be able
to consider seriously or will satisfy the Mobian story followers.
I'm easily amused though, so I think it's one of the fun ones.
(I would be annoyed if this where an expensive comic..) Be thankful
that Chris Riccarrdi or Mike Kazaleh don't work for Archie. :)

Avoiding any spoilers, an interesting thing is this month's
Dastardly Robotnik Plan uses "Microbionics", what we on the list
have referred to as Nanites.

No Sonicgrams (or Office Joke) this issue.

Story #2 is another suspense-filled two page installment from the
Knuckles saga.  I'm just shaking with anticipation for the
conclusion of this one.  (Come back Office Joke! All is forgiven!)
What's the equivalent of a "FFF" for a comic?  Look at the hand
in the second panel on the second page.

The third and final story is probably the most interesting for what
it's worth-- we get to see a bit more of Snively's character ...it
clashes a bit with everyone's previous proposals..

To Ron Bauerle (and all interested):

Regarding your question concerning Sonic's circulation ("is over a two-thirds
return rate normal and/or acceptable, or is this bad news for Sonic"?):

The answer is: don't worry!  Sonic is in fine shape.  Just the other day, we
were looking at total numbers for Sonic (including newsstand outlets, comic
shops, subscriptions, Toys-R-Us packs, bookstores, and foreign sales--
English language copies make it into such places as Australia, India and
Malaysia) and the average sale is a number that most comic publishers would
love their titles to have (and this includes many once mighty Marvel and DC
titles whose sales have dropped way below Sonic).  All things considered, I
think it's fair to say that Sonic is one of the best-selling titles on the
market.  In fact, we are now meeting to decide what Sonic specials we should
publish this year (any suggestions?)...

Hope this calms your fears...

Best regards,

Paul Castiglia

Rec.arts.comics.marvel-universe has been a bit busy lately :^)
And DC should worry too, since the only titles I was buying from them were 
the Star Trek comics, and now that Paramount's yanked that away from them, 
they won't be getting any of my business... (the recent Superman's haven't 
looked too bad from the skimming I've done, but I really don't want to 
learn a whole new post-Crisis continuity, that still tries to suck in the 
pre-Crisis stuff and does a bad job of it).  But I'm getting off-topic...

I can't help but compare Marvel's and DC's problems to the Hollywood 
situation: even though the box office shows that the general public 
prefers G/PG-rated family-type movies over the R-rated blood and boobs 
slop, they still keep churning out the latter - I guess it's low budget 
enough that it makes enough money to justify it.  I think there's a similar 
parallel to the superhero stuff: I liked the 60s/70s/early 80s stuff but 
all this "relevancy" and "grim" stuff turns me off - if I want that, I'll 
watch the news or read the paper...

>All things considered, I think it's fair to say that Sonic is one of the

More stuff like Princess Sally's miniseries!!!  More Bunnie!!!  More action 
tales and not kid stuff like the germ story in #33!  I'm rather neutral on 
stuff like Knuckels/Chaotix - I find it detracts from rather than enhances 
the Freedom Fighter theme, but if the Sega-heads out there (er, no offense :^))
want it, that's OK I guess...

Assuming the Sonic Sat. AM show is gone for good, why not pick up where it 
left off?  Maybe you can get a hold of the writers for it (Allee and Hurst?) 
and see where they were planning to take it?  But maybe that's a bit much, 
since you'd have to deal with a post-Robotnik universe, and I don't know 
that you're out of ideas for the one we've got now (but please do better 
than "McRobos" :^))

>Hope this calms your fears...

It does; thanks!

 I think you should put out a book made of a compilation of the comics #1
through whatever (I don't remember what these are called so I called it a book).

Sort of like what the original TMNT comics did.

Hi everybody! I'm abck, and have about 4 pages of things to say.
     I was off the wires(?) for two weeks (financial AOL problems
:'( ), and now have 111 messages (71 left to read). I am not
complaining, I actually expected more. I am going to answer all of
the messages for the first week in this letter, so if something was
answered last week, don't think of me as being annoying. Anywayz:

I think that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being obsessed
(coming from a guy who cuts on Sonic's pictures from catalogs, and
pastes them on the wall :') ). Especially not with Sonic. I for one
am very tied up to the whole "Mobian Theory" (that's how I like to
describe it), because it is VERY similar to my own life, and has
brought me a lot of joy (a big group of people who I can talk to,
and who understand me, for one). Also, if you're not "obsessed"
with
something, then what do you do with your life, rot away in one
place doing absolutely nothing? Everyone needs a hobby. And to
close things up, my obsession has taught me something very
valuable: You are your own world, and what is outside of it, does
not necessarily have to affect it. (In other words, who cares about
what others think about you. You like what you like)

I hope that was not too much off topic, and that that helped a lot
of people feel really better.

I got it,(have absolutely no idea what i am supposed to do with it,

dead the thought (I actually get that). It's just that "Brown

The short, pointy tail, facial, and belly markings are very similar
to that of a chipmunk, but I really don't see what's so weird about
her father being a fox, and her mother being a squirrel. I think it
fits very well with super-sonic blue hedgehogs, ice-breathing
dragons, and the entire creature feature of the first season of
StH. (Just feeling left out and wanting to add something).

Who says evil would be kicked out. What about Snively? And even
after Snively, you have thousands of swat bots to deal with (sort
of like a "Terminator" theme), and maybe, some of the survivors (or
someone period) would take the opportunity to take Mobius while
it's in it's weak stages of rebuilding. Besides, I HATE endings.
Whenever a good story ends, I always feel like I want more (anyone
agree?). That's why a part of me is glad that the third season
didn't go in effect (so call me a rebel). The 3rd season not being
made forced a lot of the good writers to make stories of possible
outcomes of the Mobius. (P.S. give credit to Archie for not coming
even close to a conclusion).

In my opinion, no. Robotnik was responsible for taking over the
planet, building the roboticiser, designing war plans, etc.
Snively was only a lackey. True, he did notice Robotnik's mistakes,
but Robotnik was under "hedgehog" stress all the time, so maybe he
couldn't think straight. Snively would be under the same stress
when he comes to power. Also, Robotnik looks to me to be more
clever
than Snively. "Spyhog" gave a lot of credit to Robotnik in that
when Snively wanted to destroy the spy bug, Robotnik told him to
rip out a diode, and put it back. This way, when the spy comes to
replace it, they will be able to catch him (that was to make sure
whoever didn't see the episodes, wasn't in the dark).

In my opinion, Mobius girls and pink do not mix. I am still upset
about Archie's Bunnie Rabbot (I got my second comic, #32,
yesterday,
and Bunnie just doesn't seem to have her charm), and Amy Rose,
well, either she is rose, or I just don't approve of her very much.

Actually, I don't think I've seen it posted to r.a.a. lately either.
All that gets posted to the mailing list these days are updates to the
reviews/summaries of the comics.  The whole FAQs were getting too big,
and I think people got tired of grinding through them just for the new stuff.

If people were really interested, I could repost the updates here, but
given the level of traffic here, I'm not sure it's worth it...

Mickey Mouse is around 60.

Superman, ditto.

LIttle Orphan Annie... let's just say her growth is SEVERELY stunted.

Bart Simpson has been in the fourth (or is it fifth now?) and Maggie
has been in diapers for *years* now.

Calvin was six years old when the strip began... and he was six years old
when the strip ended, 10 years later.

Charlie Brown... 'nuff said.

In fact, in the realm of cartoons, comic books, and newspaper comic strips,
I have seen only one instance of things progressing in real time:
Baby Blues.

Now tell me, do you *really* expect Sonic and company to age? :)

     Well, I suppose there are a couple of ways to look at this. In most of
the fan-fic which is written by all of the Sonic fans, the storyline is very
serious and plausible. (IMHO, these stories seem to work better.) Because of
this serious tone and parallel to our reality, I assume that, if the stories
went on for a long enough time, the characters would age, grow, and
eventually die. ("Bloodlines" is a good example of this. If there are others
which follow this trend, I apologize to the respective authors, as I haven't
had time to read them yet.) However, in the Archie series, the games, and
the other "official" Sonic fare, no one ever seems to age. Perhaps it's
because the creators and authors adopt the standard cartoon character ideas
and eliminate aging all together. Think about it. Out of all of the cartoon
characters out there, how many have ever aged? Sure, some have had
birthdays, but never on a regualr basis , plus they never change otherwise. 
    One example to the contrary would be "For Better or For Worse", the
syndicated comic strip. The characters age just as realistically and
perfectly as their real-life counterparts. On the other hand, Garfield has
birthdays every year but doesn't really change. He technically should have
died a few years back from old age. (He's turning 18 in a few months.) From
Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin always goes on summer vacation, yet always goes
back to First grade with Susie Derkins and Miss Wormwood. (Alas, no longer.)
Many of the other cartoons which have been on the comic pages for decades
haven't changed much at all. (Beetle Bailey, Hagar the Horrible, Etc.) 
     Even though i said up above that I prefer the stories with a serious
tone(I am NOT flaming the other authors. Their work is equally enjoyable,
but on a different level. I could only hope to write so well.), I'm not sure
I would want Sonic to age very much. If he grew older, he would gain
maturity at the expense of his natural spunk and cool attitude which define
the character we all love. We all change with time. Maybe the characters'
creators didn't want them to change because they liked them the way they are? 

Just my thoughts...

-Matt

The new story Tail in Bookshire is about Tails growing pains.
It's rated PG-13 which I think is almost too light of a rating.
Man and I thought SEX class in school was bad.

Not aging is an ancient convention in the comics.  It makes the
characters easier to draw when you don't have to change the models.
There have been exceptions [strips such as "Gasoline Alley" and "For
Better Or For Worse" but they're in the minority.

Let's just say that a lot happens to these characters in the course of a
year and that they therefore lead Very Full Lives ;-).

In a sense, I agree that it might have been just as well we didn't get a
third season: I fully expected a LOT of overacting from Snively.  But
endings are possible -- I'm still drafting my "Mobius Apocalypse."

Sarcasm mode ON: oh goodie, time to start another TTBS flame war... (for 
those who don't know about TTBS, hang out on alt.tv.tiny-toon.fandom for a 
while...)

Mode OFF (partially?):  thanks for the warning, I'll be sure to give this 
one a pass (at least people are starting to put ratings on their stories; 
maybe they should be assigned by people other than the authors).

I'm probably going to sound like a prude and/or a Peter Pan, but this sort 
of stuff is _not_ what I look for in comics and fan-fic; there's enough of 
it in real life...  But I suppose I should admit (at the risk of being a 
hyprocrite too) that Tails's experiences along this line in his miniseries 
weren't too bad, mainly because they didn't get into any messy 
physical/moral details; i.e., it was just the _concept_ of growing up that 
was explored, not the _implementation_ of it.  The latter I feel is a 
private matter best left up to the individuals (whether fictional or not) 
to resolve.

One final note: I am _not_ calling for censorship; I feel people should be 
free to write stuff like this (though I'll stay out of the 
copyright/trademark discussion for now).  I'm just saying _I_ don't want to 
see this stuff, thus I want it clearly marked as such before I start 
reading it (and stuff not suitable for kids shouldn't be readily accessible 
by them either).

No, actually, the author tells me that's not happening until the sequel 
to this story...which he has yet to send me. ;)

Before all this get's too far out of hand, I would like to strongly 
stress that same thing I stress in the warning I put at the beginning of 
the story (NO, I did NOT write the story, I simply gave it the rating as 
a public service)  For the first and LAST time...it is NOT some X-Rated, 
TTBS reminicent piece of fanfic...in fact, there's no actual sex in it 
ANYwhere...so everybody get over it.  It's about Tails maturing...what's 
so wrong with that?

And, as a note to the people at SEGA, since the above is, in fact, the 
case...I don't want to hear a single word out of you.

Well, it took a little longer than I thought to find the time to cobble
this together, but here's yet another helping of fanfic.  Enjoy.

Almost happened in the comics with Fiona. Well, I seriously don't think 
they would cover that in Archie comics, but it's the direction they were 
heading. Too bad she wasn't a real fox.

p.s. I love this demented thread. :-)

     This was the part Sonic always hated.
     He didn't mind checking in with his Uncle Chuck, who worked
for the Freedom Fighters as a spy in Robotnik's midst.  He
enjoyed seeing him, despite the fact that Uncle Chuck's body had
been roboticized.  What he hated was leaving.
     "One of these days, Uncle Chuck, I'm checkin' you out of
this dump and gettin' you back to Knothole so we can deroboticize
you."
     "Nobody's looking forward to it more than I am, Sonie, but
until they've got the bugs worked out of the system, I'm needed
here."
     "I know.  But it still stinks!"
     "That's what I get for building a hideout in a garbage
dump," he smiled.  "Now scoot."
     Sonic gave his Uncle a hug, said "Be cool!" and jammed off
into the twilight streets of Robotropolis.
     As he ran the well-known streets to the edge of the city,
Sonic wondered how soon it would be before he could make good on
his promise to Uncle Chuck.  Some days, it seemed as if the
Freedom Fighters of Mobius weren't making any headway against
Robotnik.  They were able to slow down Robotnik and his spoiling
of the planet, but there still didn't seem to be a way of rolling
it back and returning things to the way they were.
     These thoughts so preoccupied Sonic that he almost didn't
hear the approaching whine of SWATbot patrols.  He ducked down an
alley just in time.  He could hear the SWATbot intercom:
      "ALL UNITS IN SECTORS D4, D6, AND D7.  ASSISTANCE NEEDED IN
SECTOR D5.  RESPOND IMMEDIATELY!"
     Strange.  Usually there were enough SWATbots patrolling a
given area to take care of anything.  If they needed that much
backup, they must be up against something big!  Sonic couldn't
resist--he had to check this out!
     Following the SWATbot hover unit from a discreet distance,
Sonic trailed it to an area adjacent to the trash heap that was
one of the Freedom Fighter rendezvous points.  Afraid that one of
his comrades was in danger, he cautiously approached to get a
better look.
     He saw a number of SWATbots...at least a dozen...converging
on someone, someone Sonic didn't recognize.  It was a badger.  He
was tall and built like a barrel.  Two leatherlike straps crossed
his muscular chest and held up a belt from which hung two small
hatchets.  The badger was using a third ax--a double-headed ax on
a long, stout pole--to ward off the SWATbots.  He'd already
destroyed several SWATbots with it, judging from the pieces on
the ground.
     Sonic had heard that there were few things on Mobius as
impressive as a badger in combat, but he hadn't really believed
it until now.  The badger didn't just lash out blindly as the
SWATbots tried to approach.  He made the most of every move,
making sure that every backswing was at least as effective and as
lethal as every thrust.  But it was clear that the badger was
beginning to tire and that the SWATbots would soon have him.  The
fact that the badger hadn't been blasted meant that he was
supposed to be taken alive.
     Not if Sonic the Hedgehog had anything to say about it!
     "It's time to play 'Bowling for Bots!'" Sonic announced. 
The SWATbots turned.
     "HEDGEHOG--PRIORITY ONE!  APPREHEND...."
     But the SWATbot never finished his sentence, for Sonic had
gone into Sonic Spin mode and simply plowed into the SWATbots.  A
second later, only two were standing.
     "Stand back, big guy," Sonic said to the badger, "I've got
to pick up the spare."
     Using the spin again, Sonic plowed into one bot, ricocheted
off him and took out the other one.  He turned back to the
badger.
     "Are you OK?"
     But the badger didn't answer.  Instead, his eyes narrowed
and he pulled one of the smaller hatchets from his belt.  Before
Sonic could say or do anything, the badger hurled it in Sonic's
direction.   It missed the hedgehog, sailing over his head.  The
next thing Sonic knew, he heard a dull, metallic CLANG.  He
turned to see one of the SWATbots he thought he had taken out
still standing, but it now had a badger hatchet buried in its
head.  It shuddered for an instant and then fell to the ground. 
Sonic turned to the badger, extending a hand.
     "Whoa, I owe you one, fella!"
     But the badger didn't say anything right away.  He only
looked at Sonic with a curious expression, as if he were coming
out of a trance.
     "Sonic?  Sonic Hedgehog?" he finally asked in a deep, smooth voice.
     "That's my name--don't wear it out."
     A broad smile slowly crossed the badger's face. "Sonic...
Sonic, it's me!  Spartacus!"
     The hedgehog's eyes widened.  "No way!" he squealed.
     "Yes way!"
     The two embraced, which was easier for the badger who was half again 
as tall as Sonic.  It was rather like a child hugging a doll, and Sonic
came off the worse for it.  When the badger
loosened his grip, Sonic was still gasping for air.  "Man," Sonic
finally said, "you've gotten...HUGE!"
     "You think I'm big, you should see Adonis!"
     "Hey, we'd better get out of here before we tangle with any
more bots."
     Sonic led Spartacus through the dump, down the twisting path
known to the Knothole Freedom Fighters.  Several minutes later,
Sonic and Spartacus paused in the evening shade at the edge of
the Great Forest.  Waiting in the shadows were two figures: Tails
and Antoine.
     "Sonique, what is the meandering of this?  Who is this
stranger?"
     "This 'stranger' was once my best bud when I was a kid. 
Spartacus, this is my pal, Tails.  And that's Antoine."
     "Hi!" Tails said as he shook the badger's massive hand. 
Antoine, however, seemed even stiffer and more aloof than usual. 
     "And wherefore were you doing in the dumps?" he asked the
badger.
     "Making a mistake I'll never make again!  For the last four
months now, we badgers haven't been able to work our traditional
mines in the hills north of the Great Forest because of increased
SWATbot activity.  As a result, we haven't been able to fashion
new weapons.  I thought I could find some high-quality metal to
bring back to our smiths to forge into ax heads.  Instead all I
found was scrap.  And then the SWATbots found me.  I was fighting
them off when Sonic showed up and saved my life."
     "How is it you are knowing Sonique?"
     "We go way back, Ant," Sonic began.  "We were both like five
years old when he came to Mobotropolis."
     "My family lived deep in the Great Forest with the other
badgers of our clan.  But about that time my father got very
sick, and it was more than our healers could handle.  So my
mother, my brother Adonis and I brought our father to
Mobotropolis, to the hospital."
     "And did they help him get better?" Tails asked.
     "My father was in the hospital for three months, but he
never seemed to get better.  Finally he died.  That's when I got
this," he said as he indicated a long diagonal scar across his
chest.  "I was cut to mourn his passing.
     "I'd never been in the city before and I guess it showed.  I
got teased pretty badly by some of the other kids.  Until Sonic
stood up for me."
     "Hey, it just seemed to me like you needed a friend."
     "And you were a good friend, Sonic.  I...I only wish I could
have told you when my father died.  But we left Mobotropolis with his
body at the first opportunity, to bury him with his fathers. 
This is our way.  And as it turned out, we left the city two days
before Robotnik took over."
     "Talk about your great timing!" Sonic said.  "I wondered
what happened to you; it was like you just disappeared."
     "When a badger dies, his family turns its back on the world for a
time of mourning.  But what about yourself, Sonic?  How have you fared?"
     "Better than fair.  We're freedom fighters, living in
Knothole."
     The badger's brow furrowed.  "Knothole?  I've never heard of
it."
     "It is just as well, for we are needing to keep it a
secretion," Antoine said with more than a hint of nervousness in
his voice.  "In factuality, we must be returning there *tout
suite*!"
     "But..." Sonic began.
     "I understand," Spartacus said.  "I have to get back to the
clan myself.  But can you meet me here tomorrow at noon?  So we
can catch up on old times?"
     "No prob!" Sonic said, getting in a quick elbow shot to
Antoine's ribs to prevent further interruption.
     "Fine.  It really is good to see you again, Sonic.  Until
tomorrow, then."  And with that, the badger turned and walked
into the Great Forest.  He moved with a speed and a quietness
that belied his size, and he was soon lost from sight.
     "Hey, Ant!  Who put the starch in YOUR shorts?"
     "About what are you talking?"
     "You know about what I'm talking!  Spartacus was my bud, and
you treated him like pond scum!"
     "We will see what the Princess has to be saying about this!"
 And with that, Antoine turned and headed back for Knothole.
     "Wow!" Tails whispered.  "I've never seen Antoine so uptight
before!"
     "Aw, he's just being his usual obnoxious self.  Let's give
him a head start; I'll bet you BOTH of us can still beat him back
to Knothole."

     
     If Sonic had hoped that Sally would be more understanding
than Antoine, he was in for a surprise when he returned to
Knothole (after having left Antoine in his dust) and told Sally
about his reunion with Spartacus.
     "And you believed his story?" was what Sally said.  Sonic
was shocked.
     "Of course I believed it!"
     Sally's brow furrowed.  She consulted her hand-held
computer.  "Nicole, verify."
     "LATEST INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE INCREASED ACTIVITY BY
ROBOTNIK IN THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF THE GREAT FOREST.  HIGH
PROBABILITY THAT SUCH ACTIVITY WOULD DISRUPT TRADITIONAL BADGER
MINING...."
     "That's enough, Nicole," Sally said as she closed up the
computer.
     "So where's my apology, Sal?"
     "Don't hold your breath waiting for it, Sonic."
     "What's with you, Sal?  This isn't like the time when we ran
into Ari -- I KNOW Spartacus!"
     "Sonic, I don't want to believe you've forgotten EVERYTHING
you ever learned.  Don't you remember anything about the Clan
Wars?"
     "The who?"
     "This is hopeless!  Between the 24th and 28th centuries, the
badger clans were split into two factions.  One faction
challenged the legitimacy of the House of Acorn to rule Mobius
and waged war against it.  The other faction defended the House
of Acorn."
     "OK, so some of the badger clans and the House of Acorn
didn't get along; so what?"
     "So during that time, there were six attempts made against
the lives of members of the House of Acorn; four of them
succeeded."
     "Sal, this is ancient history!  What's all this got to do
with Spartacus?"
     Sally paused for a moment.  "Look, just promise me one
thing: don't tell him or show him where Knothole is located."
     "C'mon, Sal, you know I'd never do anything stupid like that!"
     "Just promise, OK?"
     "OK, OK!  All of a sudden I need some fresh air," he added
as he dashed out of Sally's hut and headed for the pond.
     Antoine, who had heard most of the conversation, sat down on a
nearby chair.  "You were handling that very well, my Princess."
     "No I didn't." Sally sat down on the edge of her bed, her chin
resting in her hands.  "I totally blew it!"
     "What was it to be blowing?"
     "Antoine...I was afraid."
     "But you were having every reason...."
     "But what if Sonic's right?  What if it IS all ancient
history?"
     "Then I am supposing you are not having anything to be
worried about to meet this friend of Sonique's."
     "Antoine, you're absolutely right!"  Sally rose and, after
giving Antoine a kiss on the cheek, left her hut to find Sonic. 
Antoine was confused by Sally's meaning, but having been on the
receiving end of a kiss from her he didn't care that much.


     "Tell me again why you're doing this. Sal."  
     Sonic and Sally arrived at the appointed spot just before
noon.  Sonic had been just as confused as Antoine about Sally's
about-face on Sonic's meeting with Spartacus, but Sally still hadn't
explained why she now insisted on accompanying Sonic to the rendezvous.
     "If I thought you could understand...."
     "Hey, try me!"
     "Not yet.  When is your friend, uh..."
     "Spartacus."
     "Spartacus.  When's he supposed to be here?"
     "I'm here now."
     Both Sonic and Sally jumped at the voice behind them.  It
was indeed Spartacus, this time with only one hatchet hanging
from his belt.
     "Man, where'd you learn to be so quiet?  And where'd you
come from, anyway?"
     "Part of it is training in stalking; the rest comes
naturally.  As for where I came from, I came down that trail."
     Sonic looked for several seconds.  "WHAT trail?" he finally
asked.
     "There's always a trail, if you know how to look for one. 
It's all part of my training as a tracer -- one who follows
tracks through the forest.  The elders tell me I'm pretty good at
it.  But enough about me; who's your friend?"
     "Spartacus, this is Sally."
     "Pleased to meet you."  For several seconds, Sally could
only stare at him while three words ran through her mind: "Drop
dead gorgeous!"
     "Likewise," she said finally.
     "I didn't know that you'd be bringing her, Sonic.  Are you
two...?"
     "No way!"
     "Spartacus," Sally broke in, "I came with Sonic because I
need to know something.  I need to know how your clan feels about
the House of Acorn."
     Spartacus paused for several seconds.  Sonic was sure he
could see his old friend's face flush crimson.
     "It's to our...shame...that some badgers still want to
fight the old battles.  They're mostly old badgers who entertain
old notions.  The younger warriors, those of my generation, know
that Robotnik is the true enemy.  Why do you ask?"
     "Because I loved, and have lost, someone very close to the
throne of the last Acorn King.  And if this should get in the way
of your friendship with Sonic...."
     "Don't worry about it," Spartacus said gently, resting a
massive paw reassuringly on her shoulder.  "When I deal with
Sonic, I see only him.  And when I deal with Sonic's friends, I
see only that friendship and I respect it."
     "Thank you, Spartacus."
     "So, what is this 'Knothole' place you mentioned?"
     For the next several hours, Sonic and Spartacus reviewed for
each other the lives they had lived since their parting as
children.  Sonic mentioned as much as he could about Knothole
without giving away its position.  He also failed to mention that
Sally was, herself, of the House of Acorn, and that she had been
speaking of her father earlier on when she spoke of her loss.
     Spartacus, for his part, described life among a badger clan.
It was a rugged life with few physical comforts -- fewer, even,
than Knothole -- and one given over to preserving the old ways of
the clan.  Yet Sally detected a note of disenchantment in
Spartacus's voice.
     "I sometimes ask myself," Spartacus told her, "what the
point is of learning to fight if there's no opponent to fight. 
Sonic told you of my encounter with the SWATbots; in some ways I
was unprepared to fight them."
     "You didn't look that unprepared to ME!" Sonic chimed in.
     "Thanks, but we've never really trained to fight Robotnik or
his forces.  I feel there's much we can learn from your
experiences."
     "Then why not fight by our side, and learn from us?" Sally
asked.
     "Such a matter would have to come before our clan elders,
many of whom still think the House of Acorn is the true enemy of
badgers.  They consider Robotnik to be something best left
alone."
     "Well, why don't you kick some of those old guys out of
their jobs?"
     "You don't know our ways, Sonic.  The power they hold over
the clan is due to their length of days and experience in combat.
It will be a while before enough of them rest with their fathers
for the old prejudice to become the minority view."
     "Man, I'd sure like to tell those old guys what's really
happening to Mobius!"
     "Why don't you?"
     "Huh?"
     "Come visit the clan tomorrow evening, as my guests and as
my friends.  Put your case before them.  The worst that can
happen is that they'll reject your proposal."
     "Will they let us in?" Sally asked.  "We ARE outsiders, and
not of the clan."
     "You have also fought against Robotnik most of your lives. 
They will respect you for that, if for no other reason."
     Sally considered it for a few seconds.  "Very well, then:
tomorrow evening."  She extended a hand and Spartacus took hold
of it.
     "Agreed.  Meet me back here an hour before sunset; I'll
guide you to the clan myself."
     Soon, Spartacus had once more melted back into the Great
Forest.
     "Come on, Sonic, let's get back to Knothole."
     "Nothin' doin', Sal."  Sonic stayed rooted to the spot, his
arms crossed in front of him.
     "Now what?"
     "Seems to me that someone here owes someone else here an
apology."
     "You're right," Sally admitted, "I'm sorry I distrusted your
friend.  I shouldn't have been so suspicious."
     "That's better!  Now, why can't you say that more often?"
     "Why can't you be right more often?"
     And the banter continued all the way back to Knothole.

     The following evening, there were four Knothole freedom
fighters waiting for Spartacus.  Sonic and Sally were joined by
Bunnie and Antoine.  Sally thought that the badger clan might not
appreciate what would happen if they were to let Robotnik
continue unchecked.  So Bunnie was along as sort of a visual aid.
Antoine, who had shared Sally's apprehension that the badgers
would continue to keep the old grudge alive and might attempt to
harm Sally if they learned she was of the House of Acorn,
insisted on going along to protect Sally.  Sally finally relented
(over Sonic's strenuous objections).  This was actually a second
reason why Bunnie was coming along: to keep an eye on Antoine as
he kept an eye on Sally.
     At the appointed time, Spartacus stepped noiselessly into
the clearing.
     "Ooo-wee!" Bunnie whispered.  "Sally-girl, you weren't half-
kiddin' about them badgers!  Ah hope they got a few more like
this one!"
     "He DID say he has a brother."
     "You've brought quite a few friends, Sonic," Spartacus
observed.
     "Yeah, well, we're kind of a team.  You've met Sal and
Antoine; this is Bunnie."
     Spartacus shook her hand and stared at her for a few
seconds.  "I don't understand; where's the rest of your armor?"
     "This ain't armor, sugar.  This is little ol' me after
Robotnik got his hands on me."
     "We were able to save Bunnie, but not before Robotnik did
his share of damage.  I'm hoping to convince the elders of the
clan that they can avert this danger."
     Spartacus considered Bunnie for a few more seconds.  "It may
be difficult; some badgers would consider this an improvement."
     "It's not what you think.  How can I put this so you'll
understand?  When a creature is roboticized, they're given a
warrior's body but they're robbed of a warrior's heart."
     "Is this true?"
     "Yes.  Once you're roboticized, you no longer have a will of
your own; you can only carry out the bidding of Robotnik."
     "That IS a consideration.  As long as you put it in those
terms, there may be a chance the elders will listen to you."
     "Way to go, Sal!" Sonic whispered.
     "Thanks, but we haven't made our case yet."
     They walked on through the Great Forest, with Spartacus
leading the way.  Though the light was beginning to fail, the
Knothole Freedom Fighters instantly recognized a small clearing
they passed through several minutes later.  Spartacus said
nothing about it, but the others knew that they had just crossed
a seldom-used trail that was a shortcut back to Knothole.  They
kept it in mind for future reference.
     It was just as the sun was setting that they heard sounds up
ahead: deep and gruff voices speaking a strange tongue, the high-
pitched cries and shouts of small children, and someone telling a
cadenced story to the accompaniment of a simple skin drum.  They
knew from the way Spartacus lengthened his stride that they were
nearing his home.
     The badger settlement was a seemingly haphazard array of
stick-and-mud lodges built so that their doorways faced a central
clearing.  Small cooking fires burned in front of many of them,
boiling the contents of iron pots.
     As Spartacus entered the clearing, conversation dimmed and
all eyes turned on his guests.  The Knothole Freedom Fighters
didn't exactly feel welcome as the badgers silently scrutinized
them.  Sally saw one small boy, a mere toddler, holding tightly
to one of his mother's leg with one hand while in the other hand
he brandished a wooden spoon as if it were a sword.
     "Not exactly the red carpet treatment, is it?" Sally
whispered to Bunnie.
     The mood changed appreciably as they were directed to
Spartacus' hut.  Outside, bent over a fire, was an elderly female
badger who gave the travellers the first kind look they'd
received so far.  Forgetting about the contents of the pot, she
walked up to them and took Sonic's hands in one of her own.
     "So your old friend has grown up, my son."
     "Yes, Mother.  This is my mother, Diana."
     "Yeah, I remember you from when you were in Mobotropolis."
     "That was too many sunsets ago, I'm afraid," she chuckled. 
"But let's get your friends something to eat.  Adonis!"
     Out of the hut stepped the impossible: a badger even larger
and more powerful-looking than Spartacus.  "Adonis, your
brother's friends are here.  Fetch bowls for them."
     "But Mother, I was on my way to target practice."
     "You can hurl axes with your friends after you've showed our
guests some common courtesy."
     "They're not MY guests," he muttered as he retreated back
into the lodge.  He emerged a few seconds later with a stack of
carved wooden bowls.  Diana began ladling a thick stew into them
and passing them to the Freedom Fighters.  Sally noticed that
there weren't any spoons or forks being passed around; a quick
glance at some other families taking their evening meal confirmed
her suspicion, and she began to scoop the contents out of the
bowl with her hand, bringing it to her mouth.  The others
followed suit, the fastidious Antoine with the greatest
reluctance.
     "This is very good, Diana," Sally said.
     "Thank you, child.  And you may call me 'Mother' if it
pleases you."
     "It's a common way of showing respect," Spartacus added.
     "Thank you, but it's because of what has happened to our own
mothers and fathers that we're here.  Spartacus, when can we
speak to the clan elders?"
     "It's customary to wait until after the evening's
festivities."
     "And even then you may not be heard!" someone croaked. 
Everyone turned around.
     An extremely old badger shuffled toward them, so old that
two young males held up his arms on either side to enable him
to walk.  He stared at the Knothole residents with dark, beady
eyes.
     "Sophocles!" Diana scolded, "you just about scared the life
out of my son's guests."
     "As if that gives them the right to address the clan elders!
I know why you're here.  You can't fight your own battles, so you
want us to do your work for you.  Well, you'll get no help from
us, I assure you!"  He motioned with one hand to move off in
another direction, and the two younger badgers changed course.
     "It's because we fight better than any animal on Mobius.  We
fight better.  We hunt better.  I can still smell a member of the
cursed House of Acorn a mile away!"  He rambled on in a similar
vein until he was out of earshot.  The Knothole Freedom Fighters
exchanged a glance that communicated the same message: "It's a
good thing he can't smell one any closer!"
     "Pay no mind to Sophocles," Diana assured the others.  "When
it comes to remembering the old glory of the clan, he's the worst
of the lot."
     "I take it he's a clan elder," Sally observed, handing her
bowl to Diana for a second helping.
     "The head elder.  Who's the elder of your clan?"
     "We have none.  We live together and fight against Robotnik
together."
     "What is a 'Robotnik'?"
     "Robotnik isn't a what, he's a...."
     "Save it for the elders, Sal," Sonic said.


     The meal continued with polite conversation; the Freedom
Fighters made sure the subject of Robotnik didn't come up again. 
It was going to be a hard enough sell to the elders if the rest
of them were anything like Sophocles.  Sonic helped Spartacus
clean up after the meal -- the badgers considered this "sons'
work" -- while the others left to take part in the evening's
festivities before the meeting.
     The "festivities" of the evening, like every other evening,
weren't organized.  Some badgers took ax in hand and used a
designated tree for target practice.  Others engaged in a tug-of-
war with a stout rope.  Bunnie and Sally wandered over to a
crowd of badgers and saw that they were arm-wrestling on an old
tree stump.  Adonis was among them.
     "You!" he barked, pointing to Bunnie.  "Let's see what that
arm can do."
     Amid the cheers of the badgers, Sally tried walking away.
     "C'mon, Sally-girl!  They asked for it!"
     Bunnie demurely seated herself on one side of the stump
while Adonis knelt on the other side.  She offered her left hand
to Adonis, who wrapped his own around it.  At a signal, the
contest began.
     At first it seemed as if neither contestant had heard the
signal.  But after a few seconds the crowd realized that both
contestants were exerting equal strength and that neither had an
advantage.  Then the action began in earnest.  For the next three
minutes the momentum shifted from one to the other; just when
Bunnie seemed about to pin Adonis, the badger would let out a
roar and raise his hand from the stump, or Bunnie, her hand an
inch away from the surface, would raise it up as slowly as a
sunrise.  One of the badgers tried declaring the contest a draw;
most of the watching crowd disapproved of his attempt.  They
wanted a fight to the finish.  Finally, after five minutes that
seemed like an eternity, Adonis slowly worked Bunnie's hand to
the stump.  It barely grazed the wood but it was enough; Adonis
was declared the winner to the cheers of the crowd.  Adonis
extended a hand to Bunnie, who shook it, then got up and began
walking back to Diana's hut with Sally walking beside her.     
     "That was very gracious of you, Bunnie," Sally whispered.
     "'Gracious,' mah bunny behind!  Ah just about blew a
gasket!"
     "You mean he actually beat you?"
     "Sally-girl, you do NOT want to get on the bad side of these
here badgers!  Sorry Ah let our team down," she added.
     "Look on the bright side; maybe they won't think your
'armor' is such a good thing after all."
     Antoine, meanwhile, had been content to watch several
badgers engage in target practice using hatchets.  Unfortunately,
he was not content to simply watch.
     "Hey, Blue Coat!" one of the badgers yelled.  "Let's see
what you got!"
     "*Certainment*!" Antoine replied.  He walked up to the line
where the badgers had been standing; the target tree suddenly
looked a mile away.  Someone handed him a hatchet.
     It was then that Antoine discovered that a badger hatchet
was a large ax to most Mobians.  The thing must have weighed at
least as much as he himself.  But to his credit, he tried. 
Grabbing the handle with both hands, he hurled it with all his
might.  Unfortunately, all his might didn't amount to much and he
managed to sink the axhead into the ground in front of him.  He
struggled to maintain his composure while the badgers around him
roared with laughter.
     "You may have better luck with that one!" one badger said,
pointing to a nearby ax resting on the ground, handle pointing
straight upward.  Determined to better his last performance,
Antoine walked over to it,  reached over behind his head, seized
the handle and gave a tremendous heave.
     But Antoine's string of bad luck remained unbroken.  The ax
was a trick; the handle was only loosely fitted into the axhead
and it came out cleanly.  The momentum of Antoine's heave carried
him forward and he landed flat on his face as the badgers once
more burst into gales of laughter.
     Antoine still tried to salvage a measure of dignity from
the debacle.  "You are having some activities that are a bit more
...philosophical?" 
     At this, a badger named Brutus laughed heartily.  "Oh, so
it's something 'philosophical' you want.  Perhaps you'd like to
engage in a little something we badgers call 'squaring the
circle.'"
     "Ah, the geometricals!  *Oui*, I would be enjoying that very
much more."
     The badgers cleared a spot between four stout trees.  Tying
a rope to the trunk of one tree, they ran it around the other
trees until it had formed a rough square.  Brutus then stepped
through the ropes into the center, motioning for Antoine to
follow.  As he did so, a crowd of badgers gathered around.
     Only then did Antoine discover that what the badgers called
"squaring the circle" was a euphemism for no-holds-barred
wrestling.  Antoine scrambled to get out of the ring, but he was
either pulled back in by Brutus, or if he did managed to get even
halfway out another badger would pick him up by the scruff of the
neck and throw him back in.
     Sonic, having finished helping Diana clear away the dishes,
worked his way to the edge of the ring, where Sally joined him a
second later.  They had both heard Antoine's all-too-familiar
scream, a signal that he had once more gotten in over his head.
     "Oh my gosh!  Sonic, we've got to do something; he'll get
killed in there!"
     At that moment, however, Antoine became aware that Sally was
at ringside.  In accordance with the logic of chivalry, this was
Antoine's cue to attempt the impossible for the sake of his
princess.  He ran straight for Brutus, as if to tackle him.
     Antoine's attempt came to nothing; the badger simply put
Antoine into a bear hug and practically squeezed the life out of
him, then followed that up with a belly-to-belly suplex.  The
three-count to signal the end of the match was a formality.
     While Brutus acknowledged the cheers of the crowd, Antoine
was picked up by the scruff of the neck and placed outside the
ring.  Sonic and Sally ran up to him, picked him up into an
uncertain yet upright pose, and guided him back to Diana's
hut.  His eyes were wide open but unfocused.
     "Yo, Ant!  You OK?"
     "*Sachez que je suis a votre disposition.*"
     "Say what!?"
     "*Je pars dans quelques moments.*"  Having said that, he
passed out.
     "Antoine!"
     "Forget it, Sal, nobody's home."
     They left Antoine to sleep it off and resumed watching the
next wrestling match, this one between two badgers of similar
size and strength.  After a few seconds, though, someone stepped
in front of them to block their view.  It was Sophocles.
     "You thought I'd forgotten about you two," he croaked.  "I
may be old, but my memory is still good."
     "I'm sure it is," Sally said in a bid to be diplomatic.
     "I remember.  I especially remember every injustice we
badgers have suffered at the hand of the Acorn kings."
     "I'm sure other badgers have other memories," she replied
coolly as she turned her attention to the match.
     "Yes, they remember the time before the Acorn kings, when
the throne of Mobius was held in honor."  Sophocles, too, kept
his eyes on the ring.
     "Mobius hasn't been cursed with evil rulers; not until
Robotnik, at any rate."
     "Even his rule is preferable to the cowards of the House of
Acorn."
     "Then you'd rather see Robotnik on the throne than a member
of the House of Acorn?"
     "I'd rather see the throne smashed!  The Acorn Kings have
thoroughly corrupted it!"
     It was a curious conversation that they engaged in.  Both
Sally and Sophocles kept their eyes on the wrestlers, never
making eye contact with each other.  This style -- known as "side
talk" -- had evolved into a ritual language of mutual insults in
the royal court of Mobius.  If cool heads prevailed, such a
conversation would NOT be a prelude to a duel.
     Clearly, however, this wasn't happening.  Eventually, only a
handful of badgers and the two wrestlers hadn't stopped to listen
to the conversation.  Antoine, who had sufficiently recovered his
wits, had joined Sonic and Bunnie to listen as well.  Both of
them noticed that Antoine was pale with fright.
     "The House of Acorn has never been, and never will be, an
honorable one!  Only little cowards like yourselves would think
otherwise!"
     That did it.  Sally broke off the side talk, walked in front
of Sophocles and looked him in the eye.  "Then if only to shut
your old mouth, I'm willing to take up the honor of the House of
Acorn!"
     "A typical Acorn stratagem: to issue a challenge to an old
badger!"
     "Then you can name your champion if I can name the place and
time!"
     "Done!  Adonis will be our champion.  Name the place and
time!"
     "In the ring!  Right now!"
     Barely managing to control her temper, Sally pulled off her
vest, unclipped Nicole from the top of her boot, wrapped the
handheld computer in the vest and handed it to Bunnie.
     "Sally-girl, have y'all lost your mind!?"
     "Yeah, Sal, you saw what that one goon did to Ant!  And
Adonis is even bigger!!  I say we juice!"
     "Relax," she whispered, "I know what I'm doing."
     "Girl, Ah hope so."
     Sally stepped into the ring where Adonis was waiting. 
Without any signal that the match had begun, Adonis charged
straight for her.  Antoine covered his eyes.  A second later,
however, the crowd of badgers let out a roar.  Fearfully, Antoine
looked up.
     Sally was still upright, knees slightly bent, her body tense
and ready.  Adonis was in one corner, flat on his back under one
of the trees.
     "Sacre bleu cheese!  What has been happened?"
     He got a chance to see what had happened, for Adonis charged
at Sally once again.  And just as the time before, Sally deftly
stepped aside and, grabbing Adonis as he passed her, used his own
momentum to propel him toward the far corner.  Sonic and Bunnie
resisted the urge to high-five each other.
     After two more tosses, Adonis found himself down on both
knees.  As he tried to get up, he put one arm behind him for
balance.  That was Sally's cue.  Grabbing his wrist with one
hand, she used her other hand to put pressure on his elbow,
forcing it to bend in a direction it wasn't meant to bend. 
Adonis howled in pain; the crowd of badgers let out another roar.
Sally knew that Adonis wouldn't submit to a simple armbar; she
did it mainly to buy a few seconds of time to figure out what to
do next.
     What she had to do next, however, was duck a rock that
someone in the crowd had thrown at her.  That was enough to cause
her to release Adonis from the armbar.
     "Hey!  That's not fair!" Sonic yelled out.  But before he
could say or do anything else, a number of badgers in the crowd
turned toward him with very unfriendly looks.  Sonic realized
that if he said or did anything now he'd be in the middle of a
full-scale badger melee.  He shot a quick glance at Spartacus,
who shook his head slightly.  It was his way of telling Sonic
that it would be a bad idea to say something like that again. 
Seething, Sonic backed off a step.  Satisfied that Sonic wasn't
going to protest further, the badgers turned their attention back
to the ring.
     The situation inside the squared circle hadn't changed. 
Adonis continued to attempt a direct assault on Sally.  And Sally
continued to either duck out of the way or else use Adonis's
momentum to hurl him to the ground.
     After about a minute more of this, Adonis let out a roar of
frustration.  The crowd of badgers grew silent.  Then Adonis
bellowed out one word which electrified the badger crowd: "Claw!"
     "What the hoo-ha's a claw?" Bunnie asked.
     "THAT," Spartacus said in a hushed tone, "is the Claw."
     A badger handed Adonis a cruel-looking metal glove, covered
on the back with shining metal spikes.  Adonis made a fist; to
Sonic, it appeared that the Claw had more spikes than he had
quills!  Another badger poured a clear liquid over the Claw, as
if to anoint it.
     "What's that stuff?" Sonic asked Spartacus.
     "Fire water."
     "What's it for?"
     "Just hope your friend doesn't find out."
     Another badger was now offering a second Claw to Sally.  She
took it from him and slipped it on; it practically came up to her
elbow.
     "Sonic," Spartacus whispered, "if your friend continues the
match now, she's either very brave or out of her mind."
     Just as another badger was about to pour fire water on
Sally's Claw, however, she motioned him away with her free hand. 
Then, the tossed the Claw through the ropes to the outside of the
ring, where its spikes drove into the ground.
     "That settles it, then.  Your friend's out of her mind."
     Once more Sally faced off against Adonis.  Adonis wasted no
time; he lunged at Sally, swinging the Claw from side to side. 
Once Sonic thought that Sally had been cut, but she stayed on her
feet.
     Finally, with a roar of frustration, Adonis raised the Claw
high in the air and brought it down toward Sally, who again
managed to dodge out of the way just in time.  But Adonis had
swung with such force that he buried the spikes of the Claw in
the ground.  He tugged at it once, but it wouldn't budge.
     Adonis was on his knees, his eyes level with Sally's.  Sally
knew she had to work fast.  She hit Adonis with three spin kicks
to the head in rapid succession, followed by a standing drop kick
to the head.  Adonis slumped to the ground unconscious, and his
hand loosed its grip on the inside of the Claw.  That signalled
the end of the fight.
     Sally stepped out of the ring, to the sullen silence of the
crowd.  She started putting on her vest.
     "Let's get out of here," she said softly to the others.  "I
think I just wore out our welcome."
     Sonic turned and looked at Spartacus.  The badger nodded his
head slightly.
     And then the taunts started.
     "Get back here, runts!"
     "Finish what you started!"
     "Just like an Acorn to run away from a fight!"
     "Coward!"
     This last was the unmistakable voice of Sophocles.  Sonic
had heard enough.  He was about to turn around and confront the
old badger when Sally grabbed him tightly by the upper arm.
     "Let it go," she whispered through clenched teeth.  "Just
keep walking!"
     On they walked, Sally maintaining a fast pace.  Finally she
asked: "You think we're beyond their hearing?"
     "I think so, Sal, but...."
     "One, two, three four," she said as she began counting her
steps out loud.
     "What's the deal, Sal?"
     "Just making sure, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
     At the count of twenty, Sally let out a cry like a pup and
dropped to the ground, holding her abdomen.  Her face was pinched
in agony and tears flowed from her eyes.  Her breath came in
gasps and pants.
     "Sal!  What's wrong?"
     "What is happening to you, my Princess?"
     But Sally was clearly in too much pain to answer.  So Sonic
scooped her up in his arms and, with Antoine hanging onto his
neck and Bunnie hanging onto Antoine's, he juiced back to
Knothole.

     Knothole apeared empty when they arrived, for everyone was
inside fast asleep.  Sonic skidded to a halt.  He didn't dare let
go of Sally, who was still trembling like a leaf in his arms. 
"Hey!  Somebody!  Anybody!  It's Sally!  She needs help!!"
     "We need help!"
     "Assistance!  Assistance!"
     Light came on in some of the huts and freedom fighters came
running.  A crowd gathered around Sally, who seemed to be unaware
of what was going on around her; she was aware only of her pain. 
Finally, Bookshire Draftwood managed to push his way through the
crowd.  "Get back!" he yelled.  "Give her some room!  Sonic, what
happened?"
     "It happened all of a sudden.  We were walking away from the
badger village when it hit her...WHATEVER it is!"
     "She's holding her stomach.  What did she eat when she was
there?"
     "Nothing that Ant and Sonic and me didn't have as well,"
Bunnie answered.
     "OK, so it's probably not food poisoning.  What else
happened?"
     "Sal got in a fight with a badger."
     "What kind of fight?"  So Sonic gave a short account of the
wrestling match.  When he spoke of the use of the Claw, however,
Bookshire became even more interested.
     "Did you notice if the spikes on the Claw were coated with
anything?"
     "Yeah, with some kind of water."
     "I was afraid of that.  Sonic, Rotor, Bunnie, Antoine,
you'll have to hold down Sally's limbs.  If I'm right...."
     The four of them dropped to their knees, pinning Sally's
arms and legs to the ground.  Bookshire called for someone to
bring a light, and Rotor handed him a flashlight from his
toolbelt.  Then the raccoon began gently parting the fur on
Sally's belly.
     Immediately Sally started screaming at the top of her lungs,
as if she were in the worst agony of her life.  Bunnie was so
frightened she was on the verge of crying herself.
     Finally, Bookshire found what he was looking for: three
superficial scratches on Sally's abdomen, each one not more than
an inch or two in length.  The skin around them was a fiery red
and blistered.
     "I thought so.  We've got to get her to the pool!"
     The pool where the power ring generator was located was fed
by several streams.  The largest and most powerful stream
cascaded over rocks rounded to smoothness by years of wear.  It
was to this point above the pool that Sally was taken.
     On Bookshire's orders, Sally was laid in the stream so that
her body bore the full brunt of the stream.  She gasped for
breath for the first two minutes as only her head remained above
the cold water.
     "Easy, Princess," Bookshire said gently, "try to slow your
breathing.  You don't need to hyperventilate."  Gradually her
breathing eased.
     "Man, what was THAT all about?" Sonic asked.
     "When you told me that they poured some sort of liquid on
the Claw, that was the clue.  The badgers call that liquid 'fire
water.'  It's distilled from a mixture of woodland leaves and
berries and yields a powerful neurotoxin...."
     "Hey, you're starting to sound like Nicole!"
     "Is she gonna be all right, Booker?"
     "She'll be OK, Bunnie, but she'll have to stay in the stream
until we're sure that the Fire Water under her skin has been
diluted or flushed away.  That could take a day or two.  There's
no known counteragent and no medicine strong enough to overcome
the pain of the fire water."
     "It's not like a...poison or anything, is it?"
     "No, it's used to disable an opponent by distracting him
with pain.  It's not powerful enough to kill you, but just
powerful enough to make you WISH that you were dead.  It's
probably not all that strong if you're a badger."
     "Well after seein' what they did to Sally, all Ah can say is
Ah'm glad Ah ain't!"
     "Bunnie, you'd better stay with Sally until her condition
stabilizes."
     "Try keepin' me away, Booker!"


     Bunnie didn't sleep the rest of that night as she kept watch
over Sally as she lay in the stream.  Sally's body might have
adjusted to the cold water, but her mind was still overshadowed
by pain.  Occasionally Sally would cry out after moving too much,
but she would soon settle back down again.  Finally, toward
morning, Sally was worn out from her physical ordeal, and the
pain from the fire water had subsided enough to allow her to
drift off to sleep.  Even then, Bunnie kept watch over her
friend.  It was midday when Sally awoke.
     "Bunnie, where am I?" she murmured.
     "Doctor's orders, Sally-girl.  Booker wants you to stay here
until that fire water they put on the Claw is out of your system. 
How you feelin'?"
     "Like Robotnik's been sitting on me.  I also feel incredibly
stupid.  How could I let Sophocles get to me like that?"
     "Girl, Ah'd have done the same if anybody'd trash-talked
about MAH kin like that.  Ah'm just glad to have you back."
     For the rest of the day, the two spent their time in
conversation.  So much of their lives was taken up in the fight
against Robotnik that time to simply socialize was a luxury they
couldn't always afford.  Bookshire was their only other visitor,
for he had cautioned the others to leave Sally alone until she
was well enough to return to Knothole on her own.
     By the next morning, Sally was looking and sounding like
her old self.  Bookshire told them that Sally had apparently
weathered the storm and could return to Knothole.  Sally stiffly
rose up out of the water, climbed to the bank where Bunnie had
left Sally's boots and vest, shook herself as dry as she could,
then lay down on a flat rock in the sunlight to finish drying
off.  Sally began to chuckle.
     "What're you laughin' at, Sally-girl?"
     "I was just remembering the last time I was here.  It must
have been...four summers ago, wasn't it?"
     "Yeah, Ah remember.  That had to be the hottest summer
Mobius ever had!"
     "I remember feeling so miserable in the heat, and I knew
that my fur wasn't going to get any thinner.  Finally I couldn't
stand it any more and I came up here to lay down in the water. 
I'm not a water animal myself, but even I have to admit that it
felt so good just to lie here and be out of the heat!  It was so
comfortable I must have drifted off to sleep.
     "The next thing I knew, Sonic and Tails came by to collect
the day's power ring.  I was so startled when Tails said 'Hi!' I
jumped up out of the water.  And then I saw Sonic staring at me
like he'd never seen me before.  Then I realized why: my fur--or
what was left of it--was clinging to me like another skin.  I've
never been so embarrassed in my life!"
     "Ah guess poor Tails was too young to appreciate what he was
seein'."
     "What about Sonic?  He couldn't look me in the eye for three
days after that!"  And both Sally and Bunnie dissolved into
laughter.
     "Oh, Bunnie," Sally said at last, "I needed a good laugh!"
     "After what them badgers put you through, Ah'd need one,
too!"
     "I don't get it, though.  I've been going over the whole
situation with the Clan Wars in my mind.  There have been clashes
in the past and misunderstandings, but there have also been
individual badgers who have been fiercely loyal to the Royal
House and who served it with honor, even to the death.  But even
during the Clan Wars, no badger ever went so far as to suggest
that the monarchy be dissolved!  I just can't get over Sophocles'
saying that the Acorn Throne was corrupted and might as well be
smashed.  Something about his words just doesn't sound right, but
I can't figure out what."
     "Well, like Sugar-hog said, it's all ancient history."
     "By the way, where IS Sonic?"


     Sonic was walking at a slow pace.  That in itself was a
novelty.  But he didn't feel like running.
     He was walking back toward the clearing on the edge of the
Great Forest where he had met with Spartacus.  He remembered how
happy he was to be reunited with his childhood friend; then he
remembered how everything had gone sour in the badger camp.  Even
if the news was good and Sally was going to recover, Sonic still
couldn't understand why things had gone so wrong.
     He approached the clearing, so depressed that he didn't look
to see if anyone was in there.  He stopped short, because someone
was in there.  It was Spartacus, seated on the trunk of a fallen
tree.
     "Spartacus?  What're YOU doing here?"
     "Sonic, I was hoping you'd come.  Is your friend Sally all
right?"
     "Yeah, she's gonna be OK.  How long you been here?"
     "Since yesterday morning."
     "Say what!?"
     "Sonic, I feel just awful about what happened.  I had no
idea that Sophocles had become so inflexible."
     "Yeah, well, I didn't know Sally would get in the ring with
your brother.  How's he doing?"
     "He's fine.  He told me that he respected your friends'
abilities in combat."
     "He said that?"
     "No, what he said was: 'Too bad they're not badgers.' 
That's the closest he's ever come to paying a non-badger a
complement."
     "Anyone else feel that way?"  Spartacus' silence was all the
answer Sonic needed.
     "Here," Spartacus finally said, "give this to Sally when you
see her."  With that, he handed Sonic a rough-woven canvas bag,
tied with string at the top.  A paper tag hung from the end of
the string.
     "What's in this thing?"
     "I'd rather you give it to Sally as is."
     "Oh. OK."  Sonic turned to go.
     "Sonic!"
     "Yeah, what?"
     "I...I'm truly sorry."
     "Hey, it's cool.  Later."


     Sonic arrived back at Knothole a short time later, but
nobody seemed to be interested.  Instead, everyone was clustering
around Princess Sally, whom Bunnie had accompanied from the pool.
Even though Bunnie and Antoine had each answered dozens of
questions about the badgers and about the fight, everyone wanted
to hear about it from Sally.  What she said wasn't exactly good
news:
     "No, I don't think we can rely on the badgers of that clan
as freedom fighters.  Not only do they live pretty much to
themselves, but their hatred of the House of Acorn appears to be
as deep as ever."
     "Yo, Sal!" Sonic called out.  The crowd of Mobians
surrounding Sally parted and Sonic walked toward her.  "You
feeling OK?"
     "Much better, thanks.  Where have you been?"
     "I was talking with Spartacus in the clearing.  He was
really bummed by what happened, and he said for me to give you
this."  Sonic handed the bag to Sally.  She spotted the paper tag
at the bag's neck.  She tore it off and set the bag down on the
ground.
     "Sonic, how come there's no writing on this tag?"
     "Huh?"
     "What's in that bag, anyway?"
     "He didn't say."
     "Anyone else smell that?"  Bookshire asked.
     "Yeah," Tails said.  "What IS that?"
     Rotor sniffed the air.  "Smells like...pine tar."
     "Pine tar?"  Bookshire picked up the bag.  He placed his
hand against it and immediately jerked it away.
     "Everybody back off!  This thing's hot!"
     Everyone backed away.  Everyone, that is, except Sonic. 
Taking the bag from Bookshire, he bolted from the clearing,
returning two seconds later.
     "No problemo, guys.  I pitched that thing into the Great
Swamp."
     Everyone started to congratulate Sonic, but Sally seemed
lost in thought.  Then, borrowing a rangefinder from Rotor, she
ran toward a nearby tree.
     "Where do you think you're going?" Bookshire called after
her.
     "You SAID I needed some exercise after all that time flat on
my back!" she called back as she began climbing.  In a few
seconds she was lost from sight, only to reappear a few more
seconds later on her way down.
     "What was THAT all about, Sal?" Sonic asked.
     "We've got trouble, Sonic."
     "Hey, I ditched that bomb, remember?"
     "I wondered why we hadn't heard an explosion if that really
was a bomb, so I went up to have a look."
     "So what'ja see?"
     "I saw a huge column of black smoke rising from the Great
Swamp.  I also saw two of Robotnik's hover units converging on
the site, and another two on the horizon.
     "Sonic, I don't think that bomb was meant to blow up and
harm anyone.  I believe it was a smoke bomb, meant to betray our
position to Robotnik and to lead those hover units straight to
Knothole."
     This was sobering news to the residents of Knothole, for
whom the secrecy of their location was a tactical strength. 
Sonic took the news hard.  His expression went from shock to deep
hurt to boiling anger.  "OK, THAT'S IT!!" he yelled, and tore off
into the woods without a word of warning.  The others began to
pick themselves up off the ground, having been left in Sonic's
wake.
     "Oh my gosh," Sally said, "I've never seen Sonic so angry
about ANYTHING before!"
     "Ah'd hate to be those badgers when Sugar-hog gets there!"
     "I think Sonic's going to be the least of the badgers'
worries," Bookshire observed.
     "Why?" Sally asked.
     "Because if that smoke bomb was indeed Robotnik's idea, and
if Robotnik has four hover units loaded with SWATbots in the
area, those badgers are going to have some explaining to do."


     "INCOMPETENT!" Sophocles roared at Spartacus.  "Your mission
failed!"
     Sophocles stood in the center of the assembled badgers of
the clan.  That morning, when Spartacus had returned without the
sack, the badger elder had issued a call to arms for all able-
bodies badgers of the clan.  The call went through the clan like
a bolt of lightning.  Weapons were gathered and sharpened,
anticipation ran high.  But now two young scouts had reported
that the smoke column they had been sent to follow originated,
not in some village, but in the heart of the Great Swamp. 
Sophocles didn't take the news well.
     "It failed!" he repeated.  "How then are we to have our
revenge against those who sympathize with the House of Acorn?"
     "Revenge!?" Adonis spoke up, as all eyes turned to him. 
"Revenge for what?  They harmed no one here except myself, and
even then the damage was only to my pride.  What cause have we to
fight them?"
     "Because they represent the House of Acorn.  They are an
impediment to the rule of Mobius by its rightful overlord."
     "And just who is this rightful overlord, Sophocles? 
Yourself?"
     "I speak of...Ivo Robotnik."
     There were several seconds of stunned silence.  That name
had never crossed the lips of Sophocles before.  Adonis, baring
all his teeth in a snarl, picked up a nearby ax.  "You withered
old traitor!" he yelled as he hurled the ax at the old badger.
     Sophocles, however, tossed aside the two younger badgers who
had been supporting him as if they were nothing.  He caught the
ax in mid-flight before it could strike him.  Then, with no
warning, he hurled it back at Adonis, where it struck him in the
chest.  He was dead before he hit the ground.
     Diana began to scream, as did every other badger.  Anyone
who could pick up a weapon did so and began to rush toward
Sophocles.  It was a badger melee.
     But the melee was short-lived, for suddenly the woods
surrounding the badger encampment erupted with blaster fire. 
SWATbots began emerging from the woods, shoulder to shoulder. 
The melee ended as swiftly as it had started, with five more
badgers dead.
     Sophocles now strode to one of the SWATbots with a youthful
vigor the badgers had never seen before.  The SWATbot carried a
communicator, and Sophocles began speaking into it: "Can you hear
me, Dr. Robotnik?"
     Those badgers close enough to Sophocles could hear
Robotnik's malevolent voice on the communicator: "Have you begun
the attack on Knothole yet?"
     "Negative.  The smoke bomb was diverted to the Great Swamp,
and resistance to you among the badgers is still strong.  I had
to order the SWATbots to attack the village.  Your plan appears
to be infeasible."
     "BLAST IT!" Robotnik cursed, then spoke in a more measured
voice: "Never mind, then.  Select the strongest of the badgers
and roboticize them; if they won't fight for me, they'll at least
slave for me."
     "And the others, Dr. Robotnik?"
     There was a pause.  "Do you think I really care what happens
to the others?"
     "Understood, Sir."
     Handing the communicator back to the SWATbot, Sophocles
strode to Spartacus who, like Diana, was bent over the fallen
Adonis.  He seized Spartacus by the throat and lifted him to his
feet.
     "Now you shall pay for your incompetence!"
     He released Spartacus, who was grabbed by two SWATbots. 
Spartacus was too overcome by shock and grief to resist.  The
SWATbots took him to the edge of the village, where a portable
roboticizer unit had been set up.  They began to raise the glass
chamber to place Spartacus inside.
     Suddenly the glass shattered into a thousand shards as
something passed through it at incredible speed--something
indistinct excerpt for its color.  It was a deep blue.
     Whatever it was didn't stop as it ricocheted off one SWATbot
after another with sufficient force to knock it to pieces.  The
SWATbots found it impossible to target the object in order to
blast it.  None of the badgers could follow it with their eyes.  
     Finally, all of the SWATbots lay in pieces on the forest
floor.  The blue blur came to a stop a few feet in front of
Sophocles.  It was Sonic.  Sophocles swiftly took up a nearby
battle-ax.  Sonic simply fixed a stare filled with hate at
Sophocles.  
     "Take your best shot!"
     Sophocles raised the battle ax above his head.  The instant
he did, however, Sonic went into spin mode and ran not just into
but through Sophocles' body.  And now the badgers could see that
Sophocles was no badger, but a replicant--a mechanical likeness. 
The body twitched and sparked and leaked hydraulic fluid onto the
ground.  Sonic returned to the body, took the battle ax from
Sophocles, said: "This one's for Acorn!", cut off the replicant's
head and drop-kicked it into a nearby fire.
     The badgers were silent as Sonic looked around him.  "Don't
everybody thank me at once!"
     He might as well have said: "Don't anybody thank me at all,"
for that's just what the badgers did.  They paid no attention to
Sonic.  Instead, they looked to another elder of the clan, named
Eumenides.
     "We must leave this place.  We will establish a new home in
the Great Forest.  Let us be off.  Leave no trace."
     Immediately, silently, the badgers began gathering their
weapons and their household goods, dismantling their lodges and
extinguishing their fires.  Sonic couldn't believe it!  He turned
to Spartacus.
     Spartacus' eyes--eyes full of anguish--met Sonic's.  In his
hand, Spartacus held a small hatchet, its blade dulled with fresh
blood.  And across his chest a fresh scar bled freely.  Then, as
if there were nothing more to say, he bent down next to Diana and
helped to bury his brother.
     Sonic stayed in the clearing for the entire five minutes it
took for the badgers to break camp.  Spartacus, with Diana
leaning on his arm, was the last to leave.  He looked back at
Sonic as if to say something, then turned away.  Sonic was left
alone, surrounded by pieces of SWATbots and by the graves of the
badger dead, buried where they had fallen.
     

     No sound could be heard inside the hut except for the
scratch of a pencil on paper.  Sally was at work decoding a
message from Uncle Chuck.  When she had finished, she took the
piece of paper and went outside.  The first person she saw was
Tails.
     "Do you know where Sonic is, Tails?"
     "Uh-huh.  He's at the pond.  You want me to get him?"
     "No, I want to talk to him myself.  I just got a message
from Uncle Chuck."
     "You think it'll cheer him up?"
     "I hope so, honey."
     Sally found Sonic sitting by the pool, looking at nothing in
particular.  Just as he'd been doing for most of the past seven
days, ever since he walked sullenly back into Knothole with his
account of the fight in the badger village.  Sally sat down next
to him.
     "Sonic, I just received a reply to my message from Uncle
Chuck."  Sonic continued staring at the pond, as if he hadn't
heard.
     "He says that according to the computer records he was able
to search, a badger answering the description of Sophocles was
apprehended by SWATbots three months ago.  And he reports that
Robotnik had indeed prepared a replicant to take his place in the
clan."
     Sonic continued ignoring Sally.  She seated herself directly
in front of him.
     "Sonic, this means that Robotnik fooled all of us, including
the badgers of the clan.  He must have wanted to infiltrate the
clan, win them over by persuasion, and have the makings of an
army of roboticized badgers at his command.  You broke up his
plan just in time."
     Sonic continued to ignore her as he simply sat and stared. 
Sally realized that Sonic wasn't about to reply.  She decided to
sit next to him.  He'd talk when he was ready, which was a couple
of minutes later.
     "Sal, I...I can't figure out why.  I thought we could be
friends again, like when we were kids.  He must have known about
the smoke bomb.  I...we were supposed to be friends.  Why did he
do it?"
     "I don't know, Sonic.  The Sophocles replicant probably
convinced him that what he was doing was for the good of the
clan."
     "C'mon, Sal, that's a bogus reason to do anything like...."
     "Like betray a friend?"  Sonic nodded.
     "Maybe to us it is, but I think I know what he must have
been going through."
     "Oh, yeah?  How?"
     "Remember, I grew up being told that I'd one day have to
make decisions that would affect all of Mobius.  Even in
Knothole, Julayla wouldn't let me forget.  Believe me, it's not
as easy as it looks.  I don't think it was any easier for
Spartacus, either."
     "Get real, Sal!  It's not the same thing."
     "When you get right down to it, it is.  It all comes down to
making choices.  And some are more difficult than others."
     "Yeah, well..."
     Sally got to her feet.  "Come on, let's rejoin the others."
     Silently, Sonic got to his feet and began walking with
Sally back to Knothole.
     "Hey, Sal, you never told me you knew how to wrestle like
that."
     In reply, Sally hooked her right arm around Sonic's left
arm, and swept his left leg out from under him with her right. 
They both fell backwards onto the ground, but while Sonic was
still recovering from the surprise Sally sprang to her feet.
     "You never asked," she said.  Then laughing like a
schoolgirl, she began running back toward Knothole.  
     "Oh, so you want to play!"  Sonic got to his feet and
prepared to run rings around the Princess.
     "Sonic!  Sally!"
     It was Tails, heading toward them from Knothole.  From the
tone of his voice, Sonic knew something was wrong.
     "What's up, big guy?"
     "The bridge.  Hurry!" was all Tails said.
     Sonic didn't waste time with further questions, but sped
toward the bridge.  When he got there, he stopped.
     A small cluster of freedom fighters stood near the end of
the bridge.  On the other side across the river stood a stranger.
This was an alarming development, since Knothole was supposed to
be a secret.
     But the figure at the far end of the bridge just stood
there.  And he wasn't a stranger to everyone there.
     It was Spartacus.
     To Sally, there was something intensely sad about him; he
looked smaller and more vulnerable than when she had seen him
before.  He had two hatchets hanging from his belt and held a
battle ax in his hand, but the battle ax trailed behind him like
the tail of a wounded animal.  In fact, that was the word that
flashed across Sally's mind as she looked at him: wounded.
     Sonic, however, bristled at the sight of him.  Pushing his
way through the crowd of freedom fighters gathered at the near
side of the bridge--a discourtesy he had never shown before--he
strode across the bridge.  Sally, sensing what was about to
happen, motioned for Bunnie to follow her back to her hut.
     "What do YOU want?" Sonic asked Spartacus.  There was no
mistaking the contempt in his voice.
     In answer, Spartacus knelt on the ground before Sonic, a
gesture no badger would make to any other animal.  "Your
forgiveness."
     "You think you can get off that easy?  You sold me and my
friends out to Robuttnik, or you TRIED to!"
     "I know; I don't deserve..."
     "What I deserve is the Fathead of the Year Award, for
thinking we were still friends."
     "Sonic, please...."
     "You KNEW there was a smoke bomb in that bag!  You KNEW that
Robuttnik was looking for us!  And you still acted like...like we
were still buds!" Sonic's voice began to choke up.
     "Yes, I admit I knew about the bomb, but..."
     "No 'buts.'  Get out of here and go back to the rest of the
badgers."
     "I can't."
     "What do you mean, you can't?"
     "I...I've renounced the clan."
     "What's this supposed to be, another scam?"
     "This is no trick, Sonic.  I've renounced my ties to the
badgers of our clan."
     "And I suppose that made Diana real happy!" he said
sarcastically.
     "It was for her sake that I did it.  The clan elders were
preparing to denounce our family as sympathizers with the House
of Acorn.  My self-imposed exile was the only way to prevent
that."
     "Gimme a break!"
     "It's the truth!"
     "So now you found us.  What're you gonna do, rat on us to
Robuttnik the first chance you get?"
     "No!"
     "How...how can I trust you anymore?  I've got a whole
village full of people here I've come to trust.  And if I thought
there was a chance of you betraying us one more time, I swear
I'd...."
     Sonic let the sentence go unfinished, not only because he
struggled with what he was going to say--that he would kill
Spartacus himself to keep him from betraying Knothole--but
because he noticed that Spartacus' expression had changed.  He no
longer looked forlorn and helpless; now he looked like he had
just seen a ghost.
     Sonic turned around and followed Spartacus' gaze.  The crowd
of freedom fighters gathered at the other side of the bridge
parted and Sally walked through them.  But this was a Sally Sonic
had never seen before...or, if he had, it was only in his dreams.
She wore a long blue hooded robe lined with scarlet and
embroidered with gold thread.  The wind caught the cape and
swirled it around, and Sonic could see that embroidered on the
back as well as over the heart was the symbol of the planet
Mobius: a serpent embowed about to bite its own tail.  On her
head was a simple golden tiara.  These were items that Sally
hadn't planned on wearing until her coronation, but she wore them
now with a gravity that filled everyone with awe.
     Sally approached the two, then brushed past Sonic as if he
weren't there.  She looked hard at Spartacus and said nothing.
     "You mean you're...?" Spartacus began.
     "You are addressing Sally Alicia, Princess Royal of the
House of Acorn and heir to the throne of Mobius."  It was the
formal language of the court.
     Spartacus was at a loss for words.  "Princess, I...I didn't
know...."
     "Silence!  You sought to deliver the Princess Royal into the
hand of our enemies.  Your actions have been treasonous.  How do
you plan to atone?"
     Spartacus said nothing.  He reached to draw an axe from his
belt and several Mobians gasped.  Yet Spartacus offered the axe,
handle first, to Sally, before kneeling on the ground before her
with head bowed low.  He bared his neck in the process.  Just as
suddenly, without saying a word, Sally raised the axe and brought
it down with a resounding thud...
     ...an inch from the badger's head.
     "Please get up," Sally said gently as she touched Spartacus'
shoulder.  The badger lifted his head.
     "You were ready to give your life to prove your sincerity,
and I accept the offer.  You have a home here."
     Spartacus rose to his feet.  "If you wish it," Sally
continued, "we can get a message to the new badger settlement for
Diana, telling her that you are well and that you have joined our
fight against Robotnik.  Your mother shouldn't have to mourn the
loss of both her sons."
     "Thank you," he whispered.  "I only wish I knew of a way to
persuade the other badgers."
     "There's only one way: by fighting together against
Robotnik, we'll prove the elders wrong."
     They made their way toward Sonic, still standing dumbfounded
at the end of the bridge.  "Until we can find you permament
quarters," Sally said, "you'll need to lodge with one of our most
experienced freedom fighters: Sonic the Hedgehog."
     "Uh, Sal, I don't think I..."
     "You'll learn!" Sally snapped.  Without another word, she
strode back across the bridge, passed the stunned freedom
fighters who had gathered on the far side, entered her hut and
closed the door.
     "Quick," she said to Bunnie once she was inside, "tell me
what they're doing?  I can't bear to look."
     "Well, neither of them are saying anything.  They're just
kinda lookin' around.  Now Sugar-hog is saying something Ah can't
make out, and Spartacus is sayin' somethin' back, and now Sonic
is saying something."
     "Is that it?"
     "Wait a minute.  Now they're crossing the bridge. 
Together."
     Sally sighed with relief and let herself lean backwards
against the door.  
     "You wanna tell me what the hoo-ha you were doin' out
there?"
     "I remembered something I said to Sonic a while ago: that I
should have trusted his taste in friends.  Something told me that
Sonic would never have befriended a badger who was an undying
enemy of the House of Acorn.  I needed to know for myself, and to
demonstrate to Sonic, that that was so.  So I put these on to
gauge Spartacus' true feelings."
     "Well, Ah'm just glad to see Sugar-hog not lookin' like he'd
lost his best friend."
     "He almost had.  Now help me out of these things.  I really
don't feel comfortable wearing them."
     "If you ask me, Sally-girl, they fit you perfect."


                                  THE END

Sigh... that's it.  I've had enough.

We had a good thing going on here, but in my eyes, we blew it.  Several
times over.

When I first got into Sonic stuff, just over a year ago, we had a great
cartoon show, a decent comic book, some great fan-fic stories written by
a handful of authors, and a developing RP saga on FurToonia.

What do we have now?  The show is gone, the RPing is in, what, it's third
attempt now, and still coming apart at the seams?  And the fan-fic?  *sigh*
The fan-fic has a reputation that, in case you don't realize, extends pretty
far out into the net.world.  Several RL friends around me, who are not
into Sonic and don't know much about it, have had plenty of stories and
rumors to circulate.  I asked one of them what all he'd heard.  He knew
I had written some of these stories myself, so his answer was, "You don't want
to know, but it would be a good idea to quit now."  So many people have
jumped on the bandwagon intent on throwing their own characters (if
not *themselves*) into the bunch, that there are all these stories out there
that serve as little more than a cry of "Hey, look at me, I'm here too now!"
or maybe a cry of, "I'm better than Sonic!  I can save Mobius by myself!"
 
I had a talk with a friend of mine once about what makes good fan-fic. 
It's the same thing that make the original material good:  decent
storywriting and a decent plot that involves the characters we all know and
love, not all these add-ons.  Maybe that's why many people here site
"Bloodlines" (Dan Drazen) and "The Temporal Syndrome" (Shawn Wolski) as their
favorite stories:  they are some of the best examples of writing that I have
seen, and they revolve around Sonic, Robotnik, and the other central
characters.  Any additional characters (such as Sandy) are there for the
story, not the other way around.  But is this what most of the recent fan-fic
has been like?  No.  Even my first stories don't fit this mold.  I was
caught up in it with the rest of us.  

And now, it seems there are authors who want to explore what the
Sonic characters might be doing (or will be doing) in their bedrooms. 
WHY??  Good grief, is it *that* titillating?  That's not what these
characters were created for, and, whether it's legal or not, if I was the
person or one of the people that created Sonic, Sally, Tails, and the other
characters, I would be insulted by this to no end.  It would really baffle
me that these people can't create their own characters and their own
universes to write these fantasies about, that they have to go and use my
characters, whom I had created for the purpose of telling G-rated stories, 
to get their kicks.

Well, like I said, I've had enough, and if nothing else, you won't have to
hear me rant and rave about this any more.

Ratman, please unsubscribe me from this list.

As for the furtonia RP, the big problem with it being like the show, is
because some of the main character names are being used, and those using
them either arent on or just do not wish to TP. :/

...Guess you're right on that part... I made Kain, but not to get him all
the attention away from Sonic or the others... Thats why i'm taking so long
on making another story: I want the stories to be more focused on Sonic and
the crew; not Kain.

Actually, it seemed to me he was pointing out what he thought was wrong 
with the Sonic fan scene in specific terms which falls within the 
guidelines for posting to this list correct? Certainly more than this post 
and too many others to bother counting. And it was less inflammatory 
than your reply was. 

I don't understand the fascination people seem to have with twisting well-
defined characters into a perverted reflection of their own adolescent 
fantasies either. The Sonic characters were originally developed for kids 
(the creation of the universe after the game I mean,) so let's try and 
keep them that way so that many more may enjoy them.

Hey, people.

I figured (since I've wandered into the risque' on a few occasions)
that I'd better set forth my hat into the ring before the iron gets
cold, knowwhutImean?

IMO, a healthy boyfriend-girlfriend (or whatever) relationship is not
purely mental in basis.  Sure, it's usually best if such a relationship
*is* grounded firmly in mutual interests and whatnot, but let's face 
facts; we're mammals.  We don't reproduce by budding, okay?  We're
sexual animals, after all, and we all feel the primal urge at one time
or another.  Naturally, this should be fodder in any realistic look
at Mobius for a few stories.

I'm not saying that should be *all* that one focuses on, before you get
the revolver out and plug me...but you can't just *ignore* it, either.
It's a part of human (and Mobian) nature to desire physical and mental
love, fellas.  Unless you're a monk or a professional harem guard,
you're gonna eventually feel Nature's tug when the vixen^H^H^H^H^H
mate of your dreams walks by.

Also, there's a difference between a good sexual drama and "smut".
Smut is stuff you see in "Hustler" and "Penthouse" in the letters
section.  All sex, no backstory, pure smut.  A sex drama has sex in
it, sure...but there's a *reason* for it in the story.  That, and
it's written in a bit more tasteful fashion.  (Every stroke of
the male organ and every yelp from said mate isn't quite necessary
to make a story "sexy".  It just makes it "nauseating".)

And, IMO, "Tail" was written well enough to qualify as a coming-of-age
story in its own right.  It didn't get overly detailed about some of
the aspects of sexual reproduction, it didn't make one's stomach turn...
hell, it was pretty friggin' funny in a few places.  Kudos to the author
of it; I wish *I* could have written it first.

And that's all I've got to say about that.

Joe.

But that isn't what these characters were created for.  Understand this:
Mobius and its inhabitants exist in *fiction*.  How they act and what they
do is entirely up to the creators of these characters.  To fly off the
handle and have these characters doing what the authors never intended for
them to do, and then try to cover it in the shroud of 'realism'... that feels
very cold.
 
> I'm not saying that should be *all* that one focuses on, before you get

If the original creators choose to ignore it, it is ignored.  If you want
a more 'realistic' look at how a a sentient male hedgehog and a sentient
female squirrel would react to each other, then how about creating your
own characters to do so?  Leave Sonic and Sally out of it.

> It's a part of human (and Mobian) nature to desire physical and mental

I'll believe that when the characters creators say that.

Maybe so.  Again I feel the it should have been written with original
characters.

ditto!  Sonic fandom is getting to be quite embarrassing lately...this is 
not what I'm here for.  I haven't read ANY fan-fic since bloodlines...and 
by the sounds of it...anything after that isn't worth reading except for 
the minute few.

It ain't that hard people....if you are creative enough to write the 
story, you can invent your own characters.

Cut it out people or I'm leaving too....and that goes for all the

supporting any more of this garbage.  Appologies to those who have been 
doing the 'proper' type of fan-fic...(the presentable kind)  Do not

Heh, now Kris knows I am one to LOVE a good argument <smirk>

But I gotta totally agree with him on his entire sentiment.  I just can't
imagine the creators of these charcters wanting to even KNOW that their
characters are being warped in peoples minds this way.

This is also one of the reasons why I made my OWN characters for drawing and
such--for one, they're MINE! :)  Secondly so that I wouldn't hafta draw
Sonic in his USUAL poses and expressions.  If I wanted something a bit tired
looking or depressed--well, my OWN character(s) can be that way and it
wouldn't be totally out of character for them since *I* made them and know
them best.

I can imagine my own character, Miles, gutting out a computer and building a
new and improved Commodore VIC-2000.  <snicker>   But Sonic?  Would be as
out of character for him to do that as some of these fanfics have gotten. :P

My 2 cents, folks!  :) 

OH!  also, gotta side with Kris on this one too, Rat dewd. :P  Seems to me

Okay, I'll accept some of that.  One shouldn't try to completely change
around the direction of the character when one writes a story about
him/her, after all.  That's just common sense.

What I *do* think is "fair use" is trying to make their relationships
a bit more real, and make them act a bit more mature than the usual
Manak fare.  Yes, it has gone a bit over the edge at times, but
"Tail" (at least in MY opinion) was pretty pedestrian compared to
what it COULD have done.

However, I see where you're coming from, Kris.  You have a certain
perception of the Sonic universe; I have my own, Bookshire has his,
etc etc.  If you don't like a fanfic story, you can always not read it.
Nobody's forcing you to download it, or page through it, or even look
at the title.  The little warning label was there at the top of the
story, in the description, and in the blurb the author posted to the
list.

Censorship is bad.  Even though I didn't like the porno pics, I'm quite
angry that Bookshire had to take them off.  Even though I don't like
all of the stories on his page, I'd yowl like a speared cat if so much
as *one* was taken off because of content.  And I'm sure you wouldn't
want THAT.

Kris, the "original creators" of Sonic the Hedgehog were a bunch of crusty
coder-dudes in Redmond (or whereever) that were making a cool game to
keep Sega from getting whooped by Nintendo.  Everything else sort of
branched out of that.  C'mon, Kris, Sonic was just a corporate sponsor
before us fanfic people started giving him *soul*.  We have done most of
the maturation of the characters; yes, Archie and Fleetway have paved
the way for us, but we continually take these characters to new levels
of...well, coolness on a monthly basis.

I really don't understand why you're becoming so irate about this.  I can
see the reasoning, I can understand the argument, but I can't understand
*why* this one fanfic story has lit your candle so.

The people who made these characters are probably off working on

Yes why...
The cartoon was great, nothing came close to it.
The first sesion was darker then the second.  Robotnik was dark and evil, 
very smart, just one problem the freedom fighters.  The cartoon went on freedom
fighters aganst robots.  Even through they could blow up a station or two
the problem still remained.  Swatbots where replaced as fast as they where
distroyed, bulidings took longer.  Some freedom fighters ever so often got
cault and roboticized.  It looks like there was little hope in this war.
The only thing that keep them from giving up was a hedghog named Sonic and a
Princess by his side named Sally.  They where the main driving force of this
battle, they would never give up.  They would die if needed to save Mobus.

Aside from that it was fun.  Bunnie a victum of an incomplete roboticization,
uses her disfigured body to fight along side the freedom fighters.
The first sesion has alot of Bunnie.  The second session very little she became
a player in the back ground.
Rotor uses his skill to help them in the both and second session equaly.
Antione a very usless wind bag who is used as comic relif most of the time.
Tails was keeped a bit in the back ground, because he was too young to fight
alond side Sonic.  The second session he does more.

The second session seem to focus on Sonic, Sally and a bit of Robotnik.
It was used as a history lession most of the time.
Robotnik has lost most of his self control in this session.  It appears that
Sonic and the freedom fights are realy starting to get on his nerves.

There is a big battle at the end, and it looks like Robotnik is gone for good.
Snively his helper takes over of whats left of Robotnik's empire.

The TV show get cut short of answering that burning question. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

And people wonder why people like us don't just give up on this hole Sonic
bussiness.

Because we don't want to.

Every wants to get into the story by creating storys.  Some write true Sonic
story others write there virsion.  Even some create storys that include them
selves.  I find that there is nothing wrong with this idea.

If you don't want to read them then don't.  I like a good story as much as every
one else.  Weather it be true Sonic or not.

My only wish is that ARCHIE improves SONIC storys.  After all TMNT is better
then the show ever was.  Why can't this happen with SONIC, what is holding
them back?  If they would only read Bookshires storys and page.  And use this
as a starting point for the comic.

The freedom fighters start chearing.  "FOR A BETTER SONIC COMIC!"

I feel better now thank you for listening.

I don't think I like this childish trend of "if I don't get what I want, I'm
leaving, and taking my ball and going home". 
It's your right to complain about it, but it's just plain annoying to try 
to throw your power around. Talk to the authors of the offending fanfic. 
They might even agree with you!

If you don't like the way some fanfic is being written, why not just NOT READ
IT? Complain to the author of the story, don't take it out on the list. 

And as far as your unreleased Sonic pics, I'd love to have them, but 
don't hold them hostage. That's just stupid.

I don't see what the big deal is. Why can't people have imaginations? Why do
fanfic writers have to stick with what the origional authors intended?  I can
understand you not wanting to read about it, but you are acting like it's
somehow "wrong" that fanfic writers get off course.

Again, why does it matter what the creators say?
Would it be better if they put a big disclaimer at the top saying 
"non-standard Sonic universe" ?

I, personally, am not all that intrested in exploring the more intimate 
aspects of Sonic's and Sally's relationship.  I know there would likely 
be intimacy if they were live beings and chose to marry each other, but 
I'll let them enjoy their relationship in the privacy of their bedroom.  
But my lack of interest does not give me the authority to make up someone 
else's mind on the subject.  It's OK to suggest an opinion to someone and 
attempt to sell them on the idea, but don't make their decision for them.

I think the original creators' wishes (if known, not second-guessed) 
should be respected, but you have to remember that the characters are 
"out there".  If you're so attached to your character that you can't bear 
the thought someone might use him/her/hir/it in a way other than what you 
intended, you should probably reconsider exposing that character to the 
public.  You can't stop someone from thinking "naughty" thoughts about 
your character (short of killing them) even if you could stop them from 
writing or drawing your character into compromising positions.

If Sonic's original creators were to speak up and tell us they are 
repulsed by the "plain brown wrapper" material, those of us who respect 
their original work need only gather 'round and support the writers and 
artists who also respect the creators' wishes and spurn those who don't.
 
> The people who made these characters are probably off working on 
> "Virtua Fighter II" or something.  Cut us some slack.

You're probably right.  Sega isn't really developing Sonic et. al., and 
DIC certainly isn't.  Archie and Fleetway are, but only at a trickle with 
a few issues per year and made none easier by difficult international 
availability of both publishers' books.  Any new books from Troll 
Associates?  Not that I know of.  If the characters aren't developed  
by "official" persons to satisfy the fans (read: market), someone is 
going to come along and do it -- and you can't depend upon third party 
developers making the same decisions you would when implementing your 
characters.  The fan writers are sort of in the same league as those who 
developed Linux, except they write for humans instead of a CPU chip.  And 
whether it's Sonic or Unix, they're freely offering their time and effort 
to contribute to a universe (or operating system) not of their original 
design.  I don't think AT&T (the original creators of Unix) would agree 
with everything that's been done in Linux  -- especially Linux's price 
(free).  The fan writers fill in the gaps left by the "orginal" sources 
just as Linux opens Unix to those who don't want to (or can't) drop 
hundreds or thousands of dollars for a copy of "real" Unix; both fulfill 
a need that had not before been satisfied.

Well, ther are already boy- and girl-friends in the Sonic universe, as 
well as kissing and "babes", so it just seems a natural expansion. You 
may ignore it if you wish.

If you leave yourself out of it, everyone involved would be happy, the

Tails has to come of age one day or another, he's already 10.

>But that isn't what these characters were created for. 

Who are we kidding? The characters were created for one purpose only: To
make money. When Sonic was first introduced back in '91, what do you think
the Sega executives were thinking about? How to create a cute, magical,
wonderful character in order to make the world a better place? I think not.
They wanted us to enjoy it, because: our enjoyment=their profits.

If somebody else were actually doing something progressive with these
characters, I might agree with you. However, since the games have been put
on hold and the show has been cancelled, I really don't think the creators
would care what we do with them now. Does anybody even know who these people
are? I really don't think it makes any difference, considering that SEGA
owns the rights to them, anyway. Also, how do you know what the creators
originally intended? For all we know, SEGA bought the rights to the
characters from some cartoonist who was using them as logos for his
on-the-side pornographic video store. As ridiculous as this sounds, the
question remains, how do we know?

I disagree again. If everything which is considered different, new or
invalid were ignored, the human race would never had advanced anywhere. Do
you think that the famous inventors in history just had a brilliant flash
and went and built something? Of course not. They tried many, many different
things, often using discarded ideas of others. That's the key to all of
this. The fan-fic authors are trying new ideas, which no one has done
before, or ideas which someone MIGHT have thought of before.  Whether
someone agrees with the content or not is everyone's own personal choice. 

     I haven't read the story yet, so I cannot make a judgement on it. I can
enjoy any story, from Jack and Jill to War and Peace. If a story is
pornographic, fine. If it's content is intended for "mature" audiences,
fine. It just better have the story to back it up. This is true whether a
story is controversial or not. If it's good, I like it. If the plot is full
of holes and the story is just uninteresting, I don't like it. Sex adds
points to the plot, it doesn't create the plot. 

Based on what I've heard, the story "Tail" involves Tails coming of age,
including the aspects of sexual maturity. As I said before, I enjoy the
stories which have a serious tone to them, so I'll probably enjoy this one.
Come on people, puberty and adolescence are very natural segments of all of
our lives. There is nothing wrong or dirty about it. I find it amazing that
discussing this stage of our growth, which has such a profound influence on
us, is taboo. 

Just my thoughts...

I would admit as much as anyone, sex is a *very* touchy topic for writers,
expecially with Sega's crackdown and my brush with (((Sonia's))) parents.
 [Read "A Time for Honesty" for my response.  It's on my web page.]

As for Violence, I won't exactly *deny* it in my stories.  Heck, it's in the

would notice, I keep the violence exclusively aimed at the poor shmoes who
desparately deserve it;  my target's are primarily Swatbots, Packbell on
occasionally, maybe Snively and even >gasp< Ro-Butt-Nik  ("FLAME HIM FOR THE

Why are some people all of a sudden whining and complaining whenever people
disagree with them? I thought that this was a list for discussion. How can
you have a discussion when everybody thinks the same way? Just stick in a
chorus of "Me too's" and get on with it? What fun. Since some of you feel
that the Sonic Universe is being ruined and that you want no part of it, I
have to remind you that we're not holding you here. You can leave if you
want. I like hearing people state their opinions, but trying to impose your
values upon others is just...stupid. I can't put it any other way. If you
want to leave, just go. Don't try to encourage any of us to join you. What
is this, a rebellion?

Actually, it usually does.  Mostly, the Alternate Universe stuff
has the more "mature" themes in it, from my observations, while the
main universe has more "purist" works.  Not to berate either class,
but merely an observation.

I tell you what, why don't I clarify that...

I put stories in the alternative universe section because they conflict 
with somethings that's already been stated in the main universe (or, 
sometimes, I can't really see them happening in the main universe)

Here's a few reasons why I put stories in the alternate section...

they support the idea of robotization poisoning the bodies of it's 
victims (Yes, Dan, it's certainly a possible, and probably accurate 
side-effect, but I jsut got a little edgy about having it in the main 
section)

they state origins of characters that conflict with stories in the main 
section that have previously established origin of said characters...

they present events that would conflict with events in the main universe 
(i.e. -- Sandra+Ryan in the main univers and Sandra+Joseph in the alternate)
(Sorry, Joe...Ryan got to it first. ;) )


Those are the real main reasons...as for the rest, it's simply a matter 
of if I feel comfortable enough to put it into the main (and yes, Joe, 
pure and more traditional) universe.  In fact, lately I've been 
rethinking a few stories, so I may move some up into the main pretty 
soon...hope I don't confuse too many people.

Take care all and may Robotnik never develop space travel...for all our 
sakes! =)

David:

Contrary to the endless stream of garbage being produced by Hollywood,
the mass media, the various idiotic perceptions of Exon's "Blue Book"
(which, by the way, the contents of which were illegal ten years before)
and the great majority of the "ME TOO" posters on the alt.binaries.*
and alt.2600 newsgroups regarding acquisition of porno and various
copies of the LoD technical manual from a certain domain that I will not
speak the name of, sex and violence are NOT *NOT* N-O-fragging-T the
main products of the Internet.

It is a well-known fact to most people who roam the darker corridors
of the Internet (and its popular offspring, the WWW) that porno and
bomb-making files are a real pain in the arse to acquire if you do not
know EXACTLY where to look.  Even if you use the mighty Lycos search
engine and hit Archie and Veronica, it takes a good deal of technical
prowess to find most of the more...dangerous underground works.

Famous works of literature?  Two clicks away from anywhere.  Anime
pages?  Three.  Government documents, encyclopedias, cool robot arms,
all a few clicks away from most places.  But porno and bombs?
A bit harder, and far, FAR, less prevalent.

Also, on a less pressing issue, please stop taking the name of Phrack
in vain.  It was one of the great e-zines.  It doesn't deserve the
degredation of being a cuss word.  =)

Exactly.  While I don't like some of the stories on Book's page,
I would be the first to stand up and yell my head off if Sega or anyone
else tried to get it removed on the basis of content.  It's just the way
I am, y'see.  I've said it once, and I'll say it again.  Censorship is bad.
Bad, bad, bad.  It's not good sense, good business, or psychologically
healthy to force someone to express their thoughts in a way that *you*
dictate.  After all, that's how they *win*...

Another point I agree with.  Personally, the only things I have about
people utilizing Joseph in their fanfic are timeline gumups and
little errors in character development.  This is why I usually avoid
including my character in other people's writing...I've got Joseph's
adventures loosely planned out for the next several arcs, and I don't
like crossovers gumming up the works.

I've got to write the fence a bit on this one.  For one thing, Sonic's
original creators, most likely a group of coders, have really left
the blue guy to blow around in the wind creatively for a good, long time.
Archie and Fleetway've had their way with him, as well as a goodly
number of fanfic writers.  It's like the American colonies after the
French and Indian War; the salutary neglect of the character (the colonies)
have given the stand-in creative influence (the people of the colonies) 
a feeling of psudocontrol (the desire for independence) over his destiny.  
Therefore, any attempt by the long-absent creators (the British Empire) 
at Sega to interfere with our setup would cause a big ol' fight.

And you know what?  Unless the story was personally offensive to myself,
I'd pass the ammunition.
