I've sen it, and thank you for posting a new Bunnie pic! :) For those who 
haven't seen it, get it- It's Bunnie & Tails drawn in anime style, and 
it's definitely worth an "awwwwww"... :)

*Grin!* "brobbot.gif" by Doug Winger... :) Well, in answer to your 
question, Bunnie appears to be a DiC-created character (correct me if I'm 
wrong, fellas), and I would say the SatAM StH version of Bunnie is more 
correct...

Right on the nose.. :) And actually, if you recall her de-roboticised 
form in "Sonic Conversions" (SatAM StH, Season 2), she still had her sexy 
figure, so I'd say "despite" above... :) I admire her, not only for her 
sexiness (which she radiates so well! ;) ), but because she is so bright 
and positive under the strain of adversity- She does not let her 
roboticisation get her down or impede on herf sensuality.... :) Just what 
a chronic depressive needs for a role model.... :)

If this hAsn't been answered yet, I will: they're Windosw icons... If

You're referring to Dulcy... :) Actually, I *liked* Cree Summer-Franck's

comic flavour whenever she crashed... :) I'm *reallly* happy to see her

My suggestion as a writer: just do it... :) Stalling only increases the

Since it seems to be customary for people to post about new pictures, I've 
put one under rat.org:/pub/sonic/images/drawn/rotor-sl.jpg
This is one of Rotor as a kid; something I plan to do all the Sonic 
characters as like they appeared in the Blast to the Past episodes. Yes, 
Bunnie is halfway done, but had to be delayed for a couple other projects 
at the moment. Sorry Quozl. ;) Look for more of the "Sonic Kids series" 
in the future.
[As Rat pointed out, will Tails look like a fetus? :) Maybe not THAT 
young, but I'm not sure how you'd get two tails through a diaper either. ;)]

	In response to the enormous need for more pictures on the site, I 
recently moved all of my archives over to an more accessible site, since 
the space in my account doesn't permit for overwhelming collections of 
pictures.  I will post the address once the archives have been put in 
order and accounted for.  

	And coming up, MORE specially drawn pics of Tails coming up!  All 
of you Miles "Tails" Prower fans will be able to enjoy more of my tails 
drawings once I get the time to scan them in and put them up on rat.org.

	Are there any more requests for pictures -- I can draw very well 
and I recently put up my homepage (new one is now at 
http://www.grcom.com/sonic4)  Enjoy the way past cool artwork there. Its 
way past cooler than the other homepage.  :^)  You be the judges, fellow

Well, after a few months of putting it off, I finally completed it.  This is
my first attempt at fanfic, and I hope it goes over well. The story is
called "Seeing Stars", and it basically involves an alien being who helps
the Freedom Fighters take something away from Robotnik that doesn't belong
to him.  Enjoy!

     The group arrived back at Knothole amid cheers for the success of the
mission.  Vision had changed back into a fox earlier, to avoid startling too
many others in Knothole, and was mingling with the crowd quite well.  Sonic
was, of course, aggrandizing his role in the mission for everyone.  Antoine
was, of course, exaggerating his role.  Tails excitedly shared what he
experienced with anyone and everyone.  This went on for about an hour,
before everything went back to normal.
 
     Vision, Sonic, Sally, and Bunnie were sitting by a tree stump, after
the crowd died down.  "It's too bad we can't get help like you provided us
on our mission everyday, Vision.." said Sally.
 
     "Yeah, " added Sonic, "Though I guess I do understand that Third Rule
of yours, at least a little, it's still too bad we can't get your help
anymore..."
 
     Vision just grinned... "Well, yanno... I have a feeling we might be
help out a little bit here and there in the future.. Bunnie, you still got
that 'toy' I gave you earlier?"
 
     Bunnie blinked. "Toy? Oh yeah, I fergot I was carryin' this around
still... " She handed the large rifle back to Vision.
 
     Vision chuckled. He examined the rifle a bit, then opened up the handle
and pulled out what looked like the power source.  "A Harani micro-fusion
battery.  The Harani don't give out their tech to just anyone, and they
most certainly wouldn't give it to the likes of Crazy Ivo.  This, and what
Blue Boy here told me on the way to Robotropolis, proves that Ivo's been
getting offworld help.  That should let us offer a little help from time to
time, though not on as major a scale as I did today. That directly involved
us."
 
     Sally nodded.  "I understand. Any help we get is good for us, and well
appreciated."
 
     Vision smiled. "Why, thank you."  He then yawned a bit, and got up. "I
must leave now, however, since today has made my body desire a nice warm
bath back at Haven."
 
     The others chuckled, then gave their farewells. "Stay cool, Vis!" "Hope
to see y'all soon!" "Goodbye, and thanks again."
 
     Vision smiled. "Farewell everyone. Perhaps you'll see more of us in the
future. As for me, you can count on it."  With that, he snapped his fingers. 
A streak of bright green energy formed at the top of his head and spiraled
down his body, leaving behind a faint blue afterimage of him, which faded
away. Then he was gone.

     The others blinked, then Sally giggled.  "I suppose we should expect
the unexpected from him from now on."
 
     Bunnie giggled as well.  "Yeah, he sure is a strange one, but his
heart's in the right place. Ah wouldn't mind seein' him again."
 
     Sonic smirked, leaning against the stump. "Yeah, he's cool.  Always
knew he was cool."
 
     Sally raised an eyebrow. "Oh, you did, did you?"
 
     "Yeah, I knew he was cool from the moment I laid eyes on him. Had cool
written all over him, right from the start," said Sonic, closing his eyes
and smirking even more.
     
     Bunnie stifled a giggle, and Sally rolled her eyes upward. "Uh-huh..."
 
     Sonic was obviously on a roll now. "Of course, ya do realize that he
wasn't as cool as me. _Nooo_one's_ as cool as your's truly..." Sally and
Bunnie got up and silently walked off as Sonic continued. "Yup, me, I'm Way
Past Cool. I'm the coolest thing to hit Mobius since the Ice Age. I'm...
Hey??"  He noticed that he was alone, and that Sally and Bunnie were heading
elsewhere in Knothole. He darted after them yelling, "Hey guys, wait up!
Hey! C'mon, what gives...?"

                                SEEING STARS
 
                           Author: Pat Carson Jr.

                                    * * *

     At the Keld'yrian base known as Haven, hidden somewhere on Mobius,
the halls were quiet... Or they would seem so to those who couldn't hear
thoughts... (Translated from Keldii)

     *<Ok, what's the status?>*

     *<Not good... Robotnik has the Ry'den Star and is en route to
Robotropolis even as we speak>.*

     *<Ack... Glad he doesn't know how to use it...>*
 
     *<That's true now, perhaps, but I doubt he will remain ignorant of its
usage for long.>*
 
     *<Yup. And when he _does_ figure out how to use it, both we, and the
remaining people of Mobius are in big trouble.>*
 
     *<I think "Not good" is one heck of an understatement...>*
 
     *<Gods, this is my fault... If we had stayed there to protect it...>*
 
     *<...then you'd both be _dead_.  As soon as Robotnik's patrol picked up
the energy signature, the amount of robots he brought to the subbase would
have easily overwhelmed you. Stop blaming yourself for this.>*
 
     *<You're lucky you managed to self-destruct the other equipment there
in time...>*
 
     *<What I wanna know is, HOW did he pick up the energy signature? We had
the subbase well cloaked from whatever sensors Mobius could produce...>*
 
     *<I've got my suspicions...>*
 
     *<Yes, but we'll need proof for those. In the meantime, we need to find
a way to relieve him of the Ry'den Star before it's too late.>*
 
     *<Can't we just go in and take it?>*
 
     *<No, Darius. Too risky. We may be able to teleport in there, but we
can't teleport out of there with it, and he's most certainly not going to
let us destroy it.>*
 
     *<Ya, too many of us there equals too many chances of him getting a
hold of one or two of us, spelling _big_ trouble for Mobius.>* 

     *<And just one or two of us going in by ourselves would be just plain 
stupid...>*
 
     *<I know the Freedom Fighters would most certainly be willing to go in
there, if they knew what was at stake...>*
 
     *<Yes, they would... Perhaps one of us should go to them and inform
them of the threat, and maybe even assist them.>*
 
     *<Hmm.. Perhaps that is the solution then...>*
 
     *<We're gonna be bending the heck out of Rule #3 by doing this...>*
 
     *<Agreed, but given the circumstances, I'd say we're well justified in
doing all the bending we can..>*
 
     *<Yup.>*  *<Agreed.>*  *<She's right.>*  *<Sounds good to me...>*

     *<Well, then it's settled.  Which group should we contact?>*
 
     *<The group at Knothole is the closest group to Robotropolis, and
Princess Sally Acorn resides there... I'd say them.>*
 
     *<Vision! You've been observing that group for quite some time. 
Perhaps you should volunteer for this?>*
 
     Vision just grinned and stood up from his chair.  *<I thought you'd
never ask...>*
 
                                    * * *
 

     In the great forest, at a waterfall in Knothole Village, Princess 
Sally was resting against a nearby log watching the clear water flow by,
Nicole closed shut by her side.  She liked this spot; It was a beautiful
location, untouched by Robotnik's pollution and dreariness.  It reminded
her of what most of Mobius looked like before Robotnik staged his conquest
of the planet.  It was a nice place to relax and reminisce...

     She was startled out of her rest, however, by a sudden whooshing sound
and rush of air.  She quickly turned her head to see a familiar blue
hedgehog standing beside her.  "Yo, Sal! News flash from Uncle Chuck!"

     Sally caught her breath.  "Sonic, you scared me... Can't you announce
yourself without making others jump 10' feet?"
 
     "Aw, c'mon, Sal," Sonic replied with his familiar smirk.  "You know
me.  I'm just too cool to not make an impression."
 
     Sally rolled her eyes upward. "Whatever, Sonic... What news did
Charles have for us?"
 
     Sonic hopped up and sat on the log.  "Robuttnik came across some
abandoned base near the Great Unknown.  Everything was trashed there except
for this big, weird crystal, which he brought back to Robotropolis."
 
     "This wasn't a Freedom Fighter base, was it?" Sally asked.
 
     Sonic shook his head. "Nope. No one knows _who_ it belonged to.  But
they _do_ know that the crystal holds a way serious amount of power.
Enough juice to light up Robotropolis for years."
 
     "Oh my gosh..." Sally gasped.  "Sonic, he could also use something
like that as a powerful weapon!"
 
     "Uh-uh," said Sonic, shaking his head again. "Ol' Robuttnik can't
figure out how to draw the juice out of it.  The fat man hasn't got a clue
how to use it."
     
     Sally frowned. "That doesn't mean he won't know how to use it for
long, Sonic..."
     
     Sonic smirked. "No problemo, Sal, we'll just have to take away his
little crystal whatchamacallit before he..."
 
     *Ry'den Star.*
 
     "Yeah! Ridden star!" Sonic then blinked. "Heyyy... Who said that?"
     
     Sally got up, looking a bit alarmed. "Sonic... I don't think anyone
_said_ that... It's almost as if it was..."
 
     *Thought to you?*
 
     Sally gasped, and Sonic jumped off the log, looking around quickly.
"Awright, that's it! Who's there?!"
     
     A rustling sound from behind caught Sonic's attention, and he spun
around to see a bush shaking a bit, then remaining still.  "Ok, come outta
that bush and show yourself!"
 
     *Can't do that, blue boy...*
 
     Sonic frowned annoyedly. "And just why not?!"
 
     *'Cause I _am_ the bush.*
 
     Sonic folded his arms, looking even more annoyed. "Yeah, right! And
_I'm_ the queen of the prom!"
 
     *If you say so, your majesty...*
 
     What happened next completely shocked Sonic and Sally both.  The bush
glowed brightly, then almost seemed to melt, reshaping itself into
something else rapidly.  When the glow faded, it was no longer a bush, but
a grinning red fox holding his hands behind his back.  He had a tuft of
hair over his forehead, and his back hair was tied into a short ponytail.
He also wore an odd gold amulet around his neck. 
 
     Sonic looked completely flabbergasted. "HUH?! What th'...?!"
 
     Sally looked equally as stunned.  _No_ species could change shape like
that... at least no species from Mobius. "Wh-Who _are_ you?"
 
     The fox smiled and walked forward a bit. "The name's Vision,
Keld'yrian shapeshifter and Lord of PEZ, at yer service..." He said with a
bow.
 
     "And _you_ two," He continued, rising back up and grinning, "are
_just_ the Freedom Fighters I've been looking for..."
 
     Sally and Sonic blinked and looked at each other confusedly, then back
at Vision. "For us??" they both said in unison.

     "Absoposilutely!" Vision replied, as he walked up to the log and
leaned against it.  He pointed at Sonic. "You're Sonic Hedgehog, leader of
the Freedom Fighters, and the biggest thorn in Crazy Ivo's bloated side.
We've enjoyed watching you."

     Sonic blinked again, then smirked.  "See, Sal? Told ya I had a fan
club."  Sally rolled her eyes at that comment.

     Vision chuckled, then turned to Sally.  "And you are Princess Sally
Alicia, of the house of Acorn.  I know you believe that titles are
meaningless out here in the woods, but you are most certainly more
qualified to lead this world than Crazy Ivo ever will be.  And far better
looking, in my humble opinion."  With that, he kissed her hand cordially.

     Sally blushed at the compliment. "Oh.. Thank you..."

     "Ahem.." Sonic interrupted, folding his arms and tapping his foot.
"How come you know so much about us, an' we know nothing about you? Like,
what you are, what you're doing here, and why you where looking for _us_?!"

     Sally bristled a little at Sonic's callousness.  "Sonic, please..."

     Vision, however, waved it off.  "All perfectly good questions, my
dear.  To answer them, lemme spin ya a little yarn about us..."  He then
sat down, leaned his back against the log, and began...
 
     "I, and the thirty others of my kind here on Mobius, come from a
world we call Keld'yr.  Our people believe in the sanctity of Life and
Freedom, and we like to make friends with other worlds that share that
belief.

     "We noticed yer world about thirteen years ago, and listened in on
yer transmissions for a few months, to get a small idea of what you were
like.  We became interested, so a small handful of us, including yours
truly, quietly set ourselves up here, to observe you more closely, first by
simply watching everyday events, then after about a year, we began to
interact with you, using our ability to shapeshift to pose as one of yer
kind.

     "We watched you for about a year, all through the tail end of the
Great War and past.  We watched the King, your father, Sally, bring an end
to the war and order all the warbots dismantled.  He wanted to bring about
a new era of peace, where people are ruled by common sense and compassion,
and most Mobians were ready to embrace that change.  That was the main
reason we finally decided to make a formal contact with Mobius, first with
the King, then hopefully with all of you.

     "Sadly, tho, it was only three days after we that decision when Crazy
Ivo had the unmitigated audacity to make his move towards conquering the
planet.  We were as surprised as everyone else was that this happened, and
were lucky to get all of us back to Haven, our main base here..." 

     Vision looked away, out in the distance, and sighed.  "A lot of us
made friends amongst you, only to see most of them get carted away to be
roboticized..."
 
     Sonic interrupted.  "Yeah, well, ya coulda' _helped_ us, ya know."

     Vision pre-empted another admonishment from Sally by changing shape
again, to face the two, becoming an orange furred cat.  "A lot of us
would've, blue boy, were it not for our Third Law."

     Sonic blinked. "Third Law?"

     "The Third Law," Vision replied, raising his index finger, "which
states: We shall not involve ourselves in the internal politics or
conflicts of any world other than our own.  We almost got into a very nasty
war by doing just that, and vowed never to do it again."

     "Hmph." Sonic crossed his arms. "How conveeenient..."

     Sally glared at Sonic. "Sonic, stop it.  It makes perfect sense for
them to have such a law."  She then turned back to Vision, ignoring a
"yeah, right." from Sonic. "Please, continue."

     Vision smiled. "Thank you. Anywayyy... Soon after the takeover, we
noticed the activity of small resistance groups scattered about Mobius.
We decided to keep secretly observing, always adhering to The Third Law.

     "Recently, however, Crazy Ivo has made a small amount of our
involvement necessary, by taking something that belongs to us."
     
     "You mean this 'Ry'den Star'?" Sally asked.

     "Vision nodded.  "Ry'den Stars are the power source for our main base
and sub-bases.  They hold a lot of power within them, and are usually quite
stable, tho you wouldn't want one of your power stones anywhere near one.
Crazy Ivo somehow picked up the energy signature of the one at our sub-base
near The Great Unknown, despite the fact that we had it cloaked, and
stormed in.  The two of us stationed there were lucky enough to
self-destruct the rest of our equipment and get out, but now he's got it.
Your fears of what will happen when he figures out how to use it are well
founded, Sally.."
 
     Sally nodded and crossed her arms worriedly. "We can't let him keep
this thing..."
     
     "Yeah.. this is major bad news." Sonic added. He then turned to
Vision.  "Hey, if you're so advanced, how come ya just can't take it away
from Robuttnik?"
 
     "Well, lessee.." Vision replied.  "We can't teleport it out.  Trying
to teleport a Ry'den Star is a _baaad_ idea.  To send just one of us in
there is just plain stupid, and if a group of us goes, that increases the
chance of one of us getting caught, and if _that_ happens..."

     Sally interrupted.  "Robotnik could become so powerful that we _all_
would be doomed..."

     "Precisely," said Vision.  "We finally decided to send someone, namely
myself, to warn you of the threat.  I would also like to assist you in this
endeavor.  If possible, we'd like our Ry'den Star back with us.  If not,
I'll be responsible for seeing that it's destroyed."
 
     "Either way, it's out of Robotnik's hands..." Sally said
thoughtfully.  "Hmm... I think we could most definitely use your help."
 
     Sonic blinked, then shook his head. "Whoa! Time out!" he pulled Sally
aside and said, "I don't trust this guy, Sal, or these Keld'yrians... He
could be working for Robuttnik, or they all could be trying to take over
Mobius for themselves!"

     Sally sighed, and said, "Sonic, that's absurd.  He obviously knows
where Knothole is.  If he was on Robotnik's side, we wouldn't be standing
here right now.  And if the Keld'yrians wanted to invade and overtake
Mobius, don't you think they would have done that thirteen years ago??"

     "But.." Sonic tried to get a word in, but Sally stopped him. "Sonic,
he knows a lot more about that Ry'den Star Robotnik has, and he's confirmed
my fears about how serious a threat this is. We _need_ his help."

     Sonic thought to himself, then grumbled. "Oh, alright, Sal... But I'm
keepin' an eye on this guy!"

     "Whatever, Sonic.." Sally said, then walked back to the log.  "Vision,
we welcome any help you can give us."
 
     "Keul!" Vision said, hopping up. "We should have a team assembled
ASAP.  I don't think Crazy Ivo's gonna be in the dark about how to play
with the toy he has for long."

     Sally nodded, and the three of them started towards Knothole's hub,
Vision trailing behind the other two, occasionally commenting on how
fascinating the foliage looked.

     "It's amazing..." Sally told Sonic, "That these Keld'yrians have been
watching us for so long, and we had no idea that they even existed..."

     "Yeah, well..." Sonic replied, "I'm not sure I like..."

     "SONIC!!" Sonic was interrupted by a familiar two-tailed fox bounding
up and hugging him.  "Hey, Sonic! Hi, Aunt Sally!!"
 
     "Hey there, little bro'!" Sonic hugged tails back. "How's it goin'?"
     
     "Goin' Great, Sonic!  I..." Tails then noticed Vision approaching and
said, "Hey, who's... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!"
He immediately hid behind Sonic from the shapeshifter, trembling.

     Sally blinked at Tails' odd behavior, and Vision raised an eyebrow,
saying, "Shyness?"

     Sonic glanced at Vision, then looked back down at Tails.  "What's
wrong, Tails??"

     Tails shakily pointed at the amulet Vision was wearing.  "S-s-sonic!
Th-that's the s-same medallion the Headless Gopher dropped where we were
camping!!!"

     Sonic blinked, then eyed Vision's amulet. "Heyyy, you're right! I 
_knew_ I'd seen that somewhere..." He glared at Vision, furrowing his
eyebrow. "So, what gives??"
 
     "Headless gopher, eh?" Vision chuckled.  "That must've been Darius.
He likes to use that illusion to scare people away from our subbase there."
He knealt down and smiled at Tails.  "You can relax, Tails, I'm no ghost.
This amulet just carries the symbol of my homeworld, Keld'yr."
 
     Tails peeked out from behind Sonic, looking more confused than
frightened now. "K-keld'yr? Homeworld?"
 
     Sonic hrm'd, then patted Tails' head. "Tell ya later, big guy.  We've
got business to take care of, and it's got Robuttnik written all over it!"
 
     With that, they made their way to the hub, formulating a plan and
deciding who to send on the mission.  Sally, Sonic, and Vision were most
certainly going.  Bunnie, because they could use her strength.  Dulcy for an
airborne escape. Sally was loathe to include Tails in the mission because of
his youth, but Sonic and Vision convinced her that his natural tracking
skills would be very helpful.  And finally, Antoine, that decision coming
after much protest from Sonic.  Sally felt that he was good for something,
and Vision noted that one more Freedom Fighter wouldn't hurt.
 
     Each of the Freedom Fighters were approached by Sally and Sonic, and
told to accompany them to the war room to be briefed on the mission.  The
entire group met at the door, which Sally opened for them.  They all
entered to see Sonic waiting for them. "Hey, guys!"
 
     "Hey there, Sugarhog!" Bunnie replied, then paused, looking back to
see the "Sonic" that came with the group walk in and up to the head of the
long table. "Huh?? What in blazes...?"
 
     Everyone else was just as confused by this oddity. "Oh, mon dieu!"
Antoine said with obvious dismay. "There ahre being TWO Soneecs?!"
 
     "Oh, I wouldn't say that..." The "Sonic" at the table replied. He then
glowed brightly and morphed into a tan-furred ferret with a ponytail and a
gold amulet around his neck.
 
     This, of course, had produced a variety of gasps and astonished
responses from most of the people in the room. "Whoa!" "Sacre' Bleu!!"
"What th'" "Oh mah stars..." "Oh my.."
 
     Sonic chuckled, having been privy to this planned display.  Even
though he still didn't trust this alien, he could always appreciate a good
prank.
 
     Sally rolled her eyes, chuckling at these antics. She walked up to
Vision and introduced him.  "Freedom Fighters, this is Vision. I'll let him
speak, because what he has to say is _very_ important to this mission."
 
     "Thank you, M'lady, "Vision said as Sally took her place at the table.
"If y'all will take a seat, I'll begin by explaining who, and _what_ I
am..."
 
                                    * * *
 
     Meanwhile, at Robotropolis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik was sitting in his chair 
at Central Command, deep in thought and looking very unamused.  "Snively..."
he said, "My day isn't looking very bright right now... How is it that I
can find such a wonderful energy storage crystal, yet not be able to use
one _BIT_ of the energy stored within it???"
 
     Snively turned away from his instrument panel and said, nervously,
"W-we've been having trouble with the power extraction equipment, S-sir...
There seems to be a tremendous amount of phase..."
 
     "Well, then..." Robotnik interrupted, "Perhaps we should _fix_ the
trouble..." his eyes glowed a brighter red. "...and _SOON_. Am I clear on
this, Snively??"
 
     Snively gulped visibly. "Y-y-yes, S-sir... working on a routine I
created right now, Sir.."
     
     "Good..." Robotnik replied, and went back to his brooding, something
he seemed to do exceedingly well...

     "Lord Robotnik..." A familiar voice spoke, interrupting his
brooding.  Robotnik spun his chair around to see Commander Packbell
standing before him, flanked by two SWATBots.
 
     "Ah, my beloved Packbell..." Robotnik said with a smile.  "I take it
that that group of rebels in your care have been processed?"
 
     "Yes, sir, they've been roboticized. Sir..." Packbell replied, "I feel
it necessary for us to double security at the laboratory where our latest..
acquisition is located."
     
     "Hmm..." Robotnik mused. "Our current resources are somewhat short in
that department, thanks to that annoying blue rodent and his friends... Are
you sure this is necessary?"
 
     "Yes, sir..." said Packbell. "The potential that this crystal has
would most certainly attract unwanted attention."
 
     "Perhaps..." Robotnik replied, "Though I doubt those miserable rodents
will discover it until it's too late... Still, I admire your enthusiasm.
Permission granted."
 
     "Thank you, sir. That is all," Packbell said, and turned around,
leaving the room. "...You pathetic, bloated fool..." he thought to himself,
"You've no idea what you're dealing with..."  He doubted that the base they
found the crystal in wasn't abandoned recently.  He also knew that the
crystal didn't originate from this world. He couldn't shake the feeling
that its original owners would soon come calling, somehow...
 
     Robotnik resumed his brooding, only to be interrupted again. "Dr.
Robotnik, sir! The latest results of our tests on the crystal have arrived!
They look quite promising, Sir!"
     
     Robotnik raised an eyebrow. "On viewscreen, Snively..." He read the
data that began to creep up the large screen in front of him, and an evil
smile crept up on his face. "Very promising indeed... Yes, perhaps I _am_
having a good day, after all..."
 
                                    * * *
  
     Vision recounted what he told Sonic and Sally with the rest of the
assembled group of Freedom Fighters, then helped them form an attack plan;
The goal being to retrieve the Ry'den Star if possible, to destroy it
otherwise.  Vision would be the one to destroy it, knowing the safest method
of rendering it unusable.
 
     After forming a solid plan, everyone waited until dark, then went
outside to take off for Robotropolis.  Dulcy looked at the group.  "I'm not
sure I can carry this many..."
 
     Sonic smirked and put on his backpack.  "I can juice over there with
Tails."  Tails gleefully hopped into the backpack in response.
     
     Vision nodded and said, "And as for me..."  He glowed and changed into
a brown-furred bat.  "I can provide my own transportation," he said with a
grin.
     
     Sally blinked at Vision's transformation, noting that she wasn't going
to get used to that for quite a while.  "Well, that's settled.  Let's move."
With that, the group left for Robotropolis.
     
     Along the way, Tails was talking to Sonic.  "Aw, c'mon, Sonic, Vision's
kinda neat! A little weird, but neat."
     
     "I dunno, little bro'," Sonic mused, "I'm still not sure I trust him;
this could be some sorta trap... I mean, Robuttnik's had aliens helping him
before, and he..."
     
     "Oh, he has, has he?" Vision interrupted, flying in closer to the two. 
"Hmm... I've had my suspicions... This bears looking into.  Tell me, you
ever see any of these aliens?"
     
     Sonic blinked startledly, then nodded.  "Yup.  It was on that Spy
Satellite that me n' Rotor took down.  It was uuuug-LY!  Looked like a big
brown furred ball, with yellow eyes, and these slimy lookin' tenticle-like
things coming out of it... It tried to wrap them around me, yuck!"
     
     Vision listened, musing, then made a face.  "Bleah... Sounds like a
Tenadian Alley Dweller.. Nasty suckers, they like to feed off the blood of
sapients.  They usually take _days_ to feed off someone.  It prolly thought
you looked pretty tasty, Blue Boy."  He grinned.
     
     Sonic blinked at that, then shuddered, nearly tripping as he ran. 
"EEEEEEEEEEW!!  YUCK!!!  That thing TOUCHED me?!?! Ewwewweww!!!"
     
     Vision chuckled, and Sally shouted down, "Keep quiet down there, we're
getting close..."  The border of Robotropolis was in view as they made their
way.
     
                                    * * *
     
     The inside of Robotropolis' buildings didn't look any more cheerful
that the outsides did.  Drab hallways, cold grey walls, and dark rooms were
the rule, and this particular building on the outskirts of Robotropolis was
no exception.

     In one of the air vents, however, the color scheme was changed
slightly, as a bright orange glow began to form a large circle on one of
it's walls.  The circle completed itself, then a grey metallic arm punched
out the metal within the circle.  The metal was cooled by some device, and
the head of a tiger popped through the newly formed hole and said in a raspy
voice, "Heeeeeeeere's JOHNNY!!"
 
     The rest of Vision's body climbed through the hole, followed by Sonic,
who's eyebrow was quirked as he said, "Weird, man, weird..."
  
     The rest of the group filed through the hole, and Sally pulled out
Nicole. "Nicole, are there any records of this building in your database?"
 
     "Working, Sally..." Nicole replied in her ever calm voice.  "No mention
of this building exist in early Mobotropolian records."
 
     Sally frowned.  "He must've recently built it.  We're going to have to
play it by ear..."  She looked at Vision. "Where to now?"
 
     "Well, perhaps we should let Tails discern that."  He handed Tails the
datapad he had been using to track the Ry'den Star's energy pattern.
     
     Tails looked at the datapad confusedly... "I can't read all these
weird looking letters..."
 
     Vision chuckled.  "You don't need to, just follow that big arrow on
there and your instincts and you'll do just fine. When that arrow starts
turning red, you'll know we're getting close."
 
     Tails nodded and smiled. "Ok. I can understand that."
 
     Vision pulled out another datapad, seemingly out of nowhere.  "And I'll
be looking out for bots in the meantime.  Shall we?"
 
     Sally nodded.  "Lets. We haven't a moment to lose."  And the group made
their way through the vents, Tails leading the way.
 
     They made their way through the vents to a dim hallway.  Assured that
there were no SWATBots present, they made their way through.  They passed a
doorway, when Vision stopped them. "Guys, hold up a bit..."  He zipped into
the room stealthily as the others looked at each other in confusion.  After
a brief moment, he came back out.  "A little toy I found. I'll explain
later."  Everyone shrugged and continued.
 
     They made a turn, following Tails, when Vision stopped them again. "Bots
coming at 3 and 9 o'clock, guys. Move towards the wall and stay put."
Everyone moved towards the nearest wall, then Vision began to change shape,
forming a metallic-like box around them. Antoine almost screamed at this, but
Sonic quickly slapped his hand over his mouth and whispered,  "Cool your
jets, Ant, or we're all toast!"
     
     Through a small hole Vision left, Sally could see two SWATBot patrols
walk by from both directions, apparently mistaking Vision for some machine
located in the hall.  After a moment, Vision reformed back into a tiger. 
"Coast is clear, let's move."
     
     They continued on, with Antoine shakily saying "I would very much be
liking a warning before yeu try and serrigate us like that again..."  

     Sally rolled her eyes.  "That's 'suffocate', Antoine, and he was
disguising us from the SWATBots..."  Antoine complained a bit more as they
continued, not noticing a shielded camera observing them from a hole in one
of the walls...
     
                                    * * *

     
     Robotnik was in the same building, in a large room, working on some
form of device.  Snively was there reading off data from a terminal, trying
to ignore various taunts from Packbell, who was overseeing security.

     Robotnik rose from his device, removing his goggles.  "There, that
should do it... Now, if only I had a suitable subject to test this..."
 
     He was interrupted by a SWATBot.  "PRIORITY ONE HEDGEHOG ALERT! FREEDOM
FIGHTERS LOCATED IN HALLWAY 13F! PRIORITY ONE HEDGEHOG ALERT!"
 
     Packbell observed the monitors... "Six of them located, Lord Robotnik.
One of them being the Hedgehog.  It appears they're heading towards this
room..."
 
     "Really? I was wondering if we'd see those annoying rodents traipsing
through here... Hmmm..."  An evil smile crept up on Robotnik's face.  "Let
them come, though not TOO easily... I have something to show them."  He
laughed as he made his way to a control panel.
     
     Packbell nodded, and ordered the SWATBots to comply.  He then looked at
the monitors again, and raised an eyebrow.. "Those datapads the fox and the
tiger carry... The fox I've seen before, but the other one... Hrm..."
  
                                    * * *
     
     The Freedom Fighters continued on, dodging a few more SWATBot patrols. 
They entered another air duct, and soon came across a large room.  Tails
looked at the datapad he carried.. "I think it's in here, guys!"
 
     Vision nodded and checked his datapad... "Just four bots outside the
door to this room... Think we should make our way in?"
 
     Sally looked out the vent, then nodded.  They opened the vent and made
their way into the room.  
 
     The room was incredibly dark, with only a few small blinking lights
providing any light.  Everyone made their way around with some difficulty,
and Sonic looked around, saying.. "Man... Someone should get the lights in
here..."
     
     "Allow me, rodent..." A familiar and malevolent voice said... The room
brightened, and a few metal boxes could be seen in the large room, as well
as a good amount of scaffolding.  There was a large, humming device in the
center of the room, with a glowing, bright yellow, multi-faceted starlike
crystal being suspended in the middle of it by some form of tractor beam. 
And, standing on a platform located in front of the device was Packbell,
Snively, and the large round shape of Dr. Robotnik.  "Greetings, hedgehog...
So glad you could drop in..." he said with an evil grin.
 
     The whole group stood in their tracks, a few gasps coming from it. 
Sally looked at the device, and the crystal in the middle of it, and
silently mouthed the words "Is that it?" to Vision, who nodded in reply.
He had a bad feeling about things...
 
     Sonic jumped forward and pointed at Robotnik.  "You've got something
that doesn't belong to you, Robuttnik, and we're here to take it away!"
     
     "Oh, are you, now?" Robotnik replied with a sneer.  "And I suppose I
should just hand it over to you? No, I don't think that's going to happen at
all, rodent.  I'd much rather destroy you with it instead."  He grinned.
 
     "HA!" Sonic shouted. "Yeah, right!  You can't even figure out how to
use that thing!"  He advanced a step forward.
 
     Robotnik smiled even more. "Oh, on the contrary... I already have.
Snively?"
 
     Snively grinned evilly, and replied, "Yes, Dr. Robotnik, Sir!"  he
pushed a button on the machine's control panel.
 
     The Ry'den star glowed even brighter, and energy started arcing along
it's surface.  Suddenly, it discharged a large bolt of energy directly at
Sonic.
 
     "WHOOOOA!" Sonic yelped as he zipped backwards just in time. The bolt
slammed into the ground with explosive force, leaving a huge hole in the
floor.  The Freedom Fighters gasped at this near miss.
 
     Snively grinned, and targetted the entire group, pressing the firing
button again. Robotnik laughed evilly as the Ry'den Star charged up again...

     The group, caught completely off guard when the first bolt was fired,
managed to snap out of it just in time to dodge the second one and scatter,
splitting the group in two.  Bunnie, Antoine and Tails ran for the cover of
a tall machine, and Sally, Sonic and Vision hid behind a set of large metal
boxes.
     
     Sonic wiped his brow.  "Oh, man!  So much for getting that thing outta
here, Vis!"
     
     Vision nodded.  "As well as my plan to destroy it safely... I can
guarantee there's plenty of more power in that Ry'den star. We're gonna have
to..." He was interrupted by Robotnik's gloating voice blaring from a set of
loudspeakers in the room.
 
     "Well, hedgehog, how do you like my new toy?  Impressive, is it not?"
Robotnik chortled.  "Surrender yourself now, and your fellow Freedom
Fighters will be given the merciful fate of Roboticization..."

     Sally whispered to Vision and Sonic as Robotnik spoke, "he could raze
all of Mobius with that thing... We have to do _something_..."

     Sonic interrupted Robotnik by yelling "Go jump into a reactor core,
Robuttnik!"

     Robotnik's blaring voice spoke on. "Well, then, since you've refused
such a reasonable offer, I've no choice but to _exterminate_ you all!"
 
     Robotnik laughed maniacally as Packbell added, "And take notice,
rodents!  If this weapon doesn't take care of you, our SWATBots most
assuredly will!"  As if on cue, numerous SWATBots began to file into the
room through the doors, searching for the Freedom Fighters.
 
     Sonic frowned as he heard the clanking metallic footsteps, and snuck a
quick glance at then machine the other half of the group was hiding behind. 
Bunnie was holding her own against a pair of SWATBots, as Tails and Antoine
hid under the machine, Tails handling things a bit more bravely.
 
     "Man..." Sonic said, turning around to Sally and Vision.  "Outta the
fryin' pan, into the... LOOK OUT!!" he yelled as two SWATBots appeared
behind the other two, firing their lasers.
 
     What happened next amazed Sally and Sonic.  Vision zipped behind Sally,
placing himself between her and Sonic, and the SWATBots, and held up his
hands, as if to try and block the laser bolts with them.  Surprisingly, he
succeeds, his hands absorbing the energy of the bolts.  The energy seemed to
run down his arms, across his back, and back to his hands, discharging in
two coarse blasts of energy back at the SWATBots, blowing their heads clean
off.  "Back at'cha, suckers!"
 
     Both Sonic and Sally stood there, completely stupified, Sonic barely
managing to emit a quiet "Whoa..." as Vision dragged the two defunct
SWATBots over.  "It's a Keld'yrian thing." Vision said to Sonic, grinning.
He then looked at Sally and shook her gently.  "C'mon, Sally, snap out of
it.  We still need ya here."
 
     Sally blinked and snapped out of her daze. "Uh, right... How can we
destroy that thing, Vision?"
 
     "Well..." he replied, ripping the back panels off the SWATBots, and
sticking his hands in each of them.  he began to glow as he absorbed
electricity from their batteries.  "My other plan for destroying it is a bit
more risky... I'll need you, Blue Boy, to provide a distraction while I make
my way to that platform Crazy Ivo's on.  Then, on my signal, you toss me one
of your Power Rings, and I'll..."
 
     "Whoa! Waitaminit!!"  Sonic said, with some suspicion.  "You want one
of MY Power Rings? Whaddya need THAT for?"
 
     Vision rolled his eyes and pulled his hands out of the now-drained
SWATBots.  "We're gonna exploit the incompatibility between the two power
sources, by... DUCK!!"  Sonic and Sally instinctively did so as a laser bolt
whizzed over their heads from another SWATBot, which Vision then fried with
a blast of electricity.  "Look, there's a game I played as a small kid where
you get a toy if you flip a metal ring onto a large spike.  We're gonna play
that tonight, but our prize this time is a very loud BOOM. Got it?"

     Sonic blinked, then smirked as the goal of the tactic dawned on him.
"Heh. Oookay, I hope this works, Vis..."
 
     Vision found a small door on one of the boxes and opened it, looking
inside.. "You and me both... Empty, good. Sally, hide in here, then be
prepared to jet out of here with Sonic when things start going haywire."
 
     Sally nodded, and climbed in, having Nicole provide light in the empty
box.  Vision then turned to Sonic.  "On three, Blue Boy.  One... Two...
THREE!"
 
     Sonic sped out from behind the large boxes, and spotted three SWATBots
approaching.  He put his thumbs on his ears and razzed them, then sped off
as they gave chase, firing at him.  Vision waited for them to pass, and said
"Wish me luck, Sally!" He began to stealthily make his way to the platform,
zapping two SWATBots headed in Bunnie's direction along the way.
 
     Sally kept the door to the box closed, saying, "Good luck.. we'll all
need it.."
 
                                    * * *
 
     Robotnik surveyed the room impatiently.  "Why haven't the SWATBots
drawn those rodents out of their little hiding spaces yet? I... What's
this?"  He spotted Sonic zipping around the large room, dodging shots from
the five SWATBots pursuing him, as well as a couple of bolts from the Ry'den
star.  "WHAT is that miserable hedgehog up to? He can't possibly believe
that..." 
     
     "Lord Robotnik!" Packbell exclaimed, turning to fire his laser rifle at
something.  He never got a shot off, however, as a bolt of electricity
slammed into him, sending him flying off the platform.
 
     Robotnik quickly spun around towards the source of the bolt, and found
Vision standing on the platform, his hands behind his back.  "Greetings, oh
fat one!"
 
     Robotnik glared at Vision startledly. "Who...? WHAT...??"
 
     Vision smirked. "WHO is one of those to whom that crystal really
belongs to, and WHAT _you're_ gonna do is give it back, if ya know what's
good for ya."
 
     Robotnik scowled at Vision's impunity, his eyes glowing a bright red. 
"Sooo... _you're_ the ones who it belonged to... hmm..."  He reached over to
a rifle laying next to a control panel.  "Well, I'm afraid that I've grown
attached to this wonderful bauble, so..." he said, pointing the rifle at
Vision, "You can't have it."
 
     Vision just sighed and threw up his arms... "Oh well, in that case..."
He then grinned. "...neither can you."
 
     *Now, Blue Boy!*
 
     Sonic sped past the platform, seven SWATBots now in pursuit.  He
reached into his backpack, pulled out a Power Ring, and quickly tossed it to
Vision.  "Catch!"
 
     Vision caught the Power Ring, and deftly flipped it towards the Ry'den
Star.  It sailed over Robotnik's head in an arc, and landed on the topmost
spike of the star with a 'clink'.
 
     *Let's move, guys, Two minutes 'till this place goes up!*
     
     Robotnik watched the ring sail over and land, then turned to see Vision
wave, "C'ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!" and jump off the platform.  he stood,
confused at this tactic, until a screeching sound coming from the Ry'den
Star enlightened him.
 
     "Dr. Robotnik, sir!" Snively shouted, panicked. "The Power Ring is
creating a major energy feedback! Systems are overloading!"
 
     "NO!" He turned to see the Ry'den Star glowing brightly, energy arcing
out in every direction, making electronics go haywire around it.  He spotted
two SWATBots nearby. "SWATBOTS! Remove that blasted Power Ring from there at
ONCE!!"
 
     The SWATBots, fearing Robotnik's wrath more than the Ry'den Star,
immediately began to advance towards it.  They only managed to get 6' close
to it before it's energies lashed out at them, reducing them to smoking
rubble.
 
     "Dr. Robotnik!!"  Snively exclaimed, very panicked now.  "The crystal's
energy level is reaching critical, and will result in a massive explosion in
two minutes! We must evacuate, Sir!"
 
     This news sent Robotnik into a total conniption. "NoNoNONOOOOO! THIS
CAN'T BE HAPPENING!!!!!!"  He smashed a monitor to pieces with his robotic
arm, then glared at Packbell, who was pulling himself back up on the
platform, not looking to be in good shape, and having some choice words to
say.  Robotnik's eyes glowed even brighter as he said, "Commander Packbell,
make sure those miserable Freedom Fighters and their friend never leave this
place!!!"
 
     Packbell stood and nodded. "Yes, Lord Robotnik." He leapt off the
platform as Robotnik and Snively left for the shuttle, muttering, "I knew
something like this would happen, you sputtering fat fool..."
 
                                    * * *
 
     Bunnie, Antoine, and Tails all caught Vision's thoughtsend, and blinked
in confusion at each other... Then the building began to shake a bit...
Bunnie exclaimed, "Darlin's, ah think it's time to get outta here!!"  She
grabbed Tails and Antoine and began running for the nearest open door.
 
     They made it to the door and turned the corner, only to find three
SWATBots blocking their path. "FREEZE!"
 
     Before the Freedom Fighters could react, however, three bright yellow
plasma bolts sailed over them, one after the other, towards the SWATBots,
obliterating them. They spun around to see Vision holding a large looking
blaster weapon. He walked over to Bunnie and handed it to her. "That toy I
found in that room earlier. Happy Holidays." He said with a grin.
 
     Bunnie OOFed a bit as she was handed the heavy weapon. "But..." Vision
held up his hand and looked behind him. "Gotta take care of Sally and blue
Boy. We'll meet ya at the rendezvous point. Bye!" He waved and zipped back
into the room.

     Bunnie blinked, then turned to face the other two. "Ok, boys, you heard
'im.  Let's move it!"  She struggled with the weapon a bit.. "This thangs
sure goshdarn heavy...  How in blazes did he..."
 
     Antoine screamed as he pointed behind her and Tails. "BUNNIE!!!!"
 
     Bunnie whirled around just in time to see a SWATBot bearing a similar
weapon on her.  She almost instinctively pulled the trigger, and it fired
another yellow plasma bolt into the SWATBot, blowing it to pieces.  She
stumbled a bit from the recoil.  "Whew! Thanks, Antoine!" She then hefted
the big gun. "This thang may be heave, but it sure 'n blazes packs a
whallop! Let's go, boys! Yahoo!!" and they continued on their way out of the
building.
 
                                    * * *
 
     Meanwhile, Sally caught Vision's thoughtsend, and then noticed the
building begin to shake.. "He did it! Thank goodness... We need to get out
of here.. Nicole, on my mark, count off two minutes. Mark." and then left
the box as Nicole counted. "Two minutes..."
 
     Sally stepped out of the box, noticing a few catwalks beginning to
buckle.. it was just then that Sonic zipped up to her. "All aboard on the
Sonic express!"
 
     Sally gasped, then hopped in Sonic's arms. "Where's Vision?"
 
     Sonic looked around. "I dunno, but he's probably doing the same thing
we are, and that's jammin' outta here!"  With that, he jetted towards the
door out of the room.  A very unwelcome obstacle made Sonic stop in his
tracks, however, and that obstacle's name was Packbell.
 
     Packbell pointed his laser rifle at the two and smiled malevolently. 
"Hello, rodents!"
 
     "Goodbye, sucker!" A voice came from behind him.  He spun around just
in time to see a brown-furred shape slam into his chest, sending him flying
into the machine Bunnie was hiding behind before, just as it was
overloading.  Packbell twitched uncontrollably, his head slammed through the
machine's control panel, then lay still, smoking and sparking.
 
     Vision landed next to Sonic and Sally, and oos, grinning.. "That's
gotta hurt..."
 
     Sonic gaped. "Whoa! Way past cool, Vis!"
 
     Nicole beeped. "One minute, 45 seconds..."
     
     "That's our cue to blow this pop stand..." said Vision, and the three
made a hasty exit out of the room and down the halls.
 
     They sped through the hallways and corridors at breakneck speed, until
coming upon the front entrance. They opened the large door, and ran outside,
only to be stopped again by a group of ten SWATBots waiting for them.
"FREEZE, INTRUDERS!"
 
     Nicole beeped. "One minute, 15 seconds..."
 
     Vision looked at the SWATBots as they advanced on the trio, then
grinned at Sonic. "How good are you at bowling, Blue Boy?"  He winked.
 
     Sonic smirked and put Sally down, reaching into his backpack. "I'm Way
past Cool..." he said, pulling out the second Power Ring, holding it up.
 
     The power ring glowed brightly, then bathed Sonic in a tremendous
amount of it's energy.  Sonic used this extra boost of power to roll up into
a ball and buzzsaw roll at the SWATBots, the ground set on fire behind him
as he managed to plow throw and smash eight of them, leaving two of the
outermost bots behind.
 
     Vision sighed.. "Seven-Ten split, Blue Boy..." and discharged more of
his stored electricity at the remaining two, putting them out of commission.
He then shifted again into a form that made Sally gasp a bit...
 
     Vision looked humanoid, with yellow skin that seemed to glow, a head of
black hair tied into a ponytail.  A somewhat muzzled mouth, hazel
colored eyes that looked like clear glass orbs, and fox like ears. Wings
that looked like a cross between a butterfly's and a faerie's, and a
slender tail with a slightly spaded tip.
 
     Vision chuckled at Sally's response. "What we really look like. C'mon,
let's fly outta here."
 
     Nicole beeped. "One minute, 0 seconds..."

     Sally blinked, Nicole's voice jarring her out of her amazement. "Yes,
this building's going to blow any minute." She hopped into Vision's arms and
they took off.
 
                                    * * *
 
     The entire group arrived at the rendezvous point where Dulcy was
waiting.  Vision's entrance made quite a stir, and he explained how his
current form was the one he was born with as Nicole counted downward. When
she reached ten second, Bunnie looked at the building in the distance. 
"That thang's gonna blow any second, guys!"
 
     Everyone watched as Nicole counted down. She reached three when there
was a bright flash coming from the building, and the entire structure blew
apart in a massive explosion, large enough to make the wind stir where they
were standing. 
 
     Antoine eep!d and shuddered.. "I ahm very fortune hunting that we have
gotten our books out of there..."
 
     Sonic rolled his eyes. "Ant, your wording stinks, as usual. Still, we
think we get the picture."
 
     Antoine hmmphed indignantly at Sonic, and Sally stepped in between the
two.  "I think this is a good time to get back to Knothole, everyone."
 
     Everyone else nodded in agreement, and started on their journey back.
 
                                    * * *

     Robotnik sat in his chair at the Command Center, seething as he
observed the exploding building on the main viewscreen.  Snively was
cowering at a smaller monitor, knowing better than to get in Robotnik's way
in moments like this... "Snively?"
 
     Snively gulped audibly as Robotnik called him.  He faced Robotnik,
wishing he had some hole to jump into. "Y-y-y-y-yessss, S-s-s-sirr?"
 
     Robotnik didn't move an inch, nor did his expression change. "I want
you to listen to me _very_ carefully... What I have to say is crucial, both
to my mental well being... and your _physical_ well being..."
     
     Snively gulped again, jumping a bit at the thinly veiled threat.
Robotnik continued, "That... alien, helping those accursed rodents...
Whatever it takes... I want to know everything there is to know about him
and his kind.... Do you hear me, Snively?" He turned towards Snively, his
face taking on a terrifying scowl, his eyes glowing infernally.
"EVERYTHING..."
 
     Snively yelped and hid behind a chair, breathing rapidly... "*gulp!*
Y-y-y-y-y-yesssSss S-s-s-s-sir... Will w-w-ork on it imm-m-m-ediatly,
S-s-s-s-sir..."
     
     "See that you do." Robotnik turned back towards the viewscreen, seeing
the rubble of the building.  The time has come, he thought, to devise
something that will rid me of those Freedom Fighters.. and that wretched
blue hedgehog... forever....

I'm sorry to do such an off topic post, but it is sort of relevant.

If anyone tries to FTP to rat.org, you will probably get a busy signal (too
many users logged in) because I put the Mortal Kombat 3 for the PC demo, and
there are very few places to get that file, so naturally, everyone and their
grandmother (well, MY grandmother doesn't like Mortal Kombat) is downloading
it right now.

So to make a long story short, the ftp site will be busy for a little while.
Just keep trying.

Ok this is the first chapter (And a little part of the second chapter.
) 
Enjoy!

Note: After certain consideration, I have decided not to make a 
continuation of "From Amy Rose with Love" Instead, this will not be 
based upon things that have happened in "From Amy Rose with Love". 
Sorry to those of you who where hoping for a continuation, but I 
don't see how Sally and Antoine could go together. (Even though I 
came up with the idea in the first place)
I perfer to write storys that go on and on and on...... such as what 
I had planned to do in "From Amy Rose with Love". Consider this the 
first of the series. Enjoy!

To Be or not to Be
Chapter One

Knothole II on the floating island.....
  "Knuckles, this is the last straw!!!!,"Espio yelled.
  "Why? What did I do?!," Knuckles asked the chameleon. She turned 
her back to him. Vector leaned back in his chair at the meeting table,
 studying a map of the island. There were several circles where they 
had spotted Mecha Sonic.
  "I saw you with that 'Princess Sally'! You kissed her, you know tha-
"
  "She kissed me!! It was a kiss on the check! Besides you and me are 
not going together! Thats why I didn't conplain when you kissed 
Vector." Knuckles glares at Vector. The crocodile simply shrugs; in 
such a way as saying 'leave me out of this'.
  "Listen you two, drop it. We have much more important things to 
worry about, like finding Mecha,he has the chaos emerald after all!  
The floating island IS still falling!! Worry about personal matters 
later!,"Vector said. Charmy Bee flew into the hut and almost knocked 
Vector over.
  "You're right! There are more important things to do!" Knuckles 
said. He was still hurt that his relationship with Espio was going 
down the drain, but there was time to talk that over later.
  "Charmy!," Espio called,"Find Sonic. You are the only one who can 
get there the fastest. Tell him to- er here," Espio wrote out a note 
for Sonic. Charmy Bee couldn't speak and that was his only weakness. 
She handed the note to Charmy Bee. He looked it over, and gave her a 
quick thumbs up. Charmy Bee flew out of the room.
  "What should I do?," Mighty the Armadillo asked Knuckles.
  "Hmmmm. You and Alisa go evacuate the island. Heres the parachutes 
for every one. Oh! Heres two for you guys,"  
The Chipmunk and the Armadillo gave Knuckles a thumbs up. Knuckles 
threw them the parachutes.
  "Well?,"Vector asked.
  "Me and Espio will go hunt down Mecha. I think we will have an 
easier time finding him if we split up."
  "What about me?"
  "You will stay here and wait for Sonic and the other freedom 
fighters."
  "Sigh. I always get stuck with the boring stuff!"

Chapter 2
......AND BRING SOME POWER RINGS. I HAVE A FEEL ING THAT THEY WILL 
WORK LIKE A CHAOS EMERALD.
  "Whos crazy idea is this?!" Sonic yelled at the Bee. He crumbeled 
up the paper. Charmy shrugged.
  "SONIC! Little ole Ant left this note" Bunnie said. She was 
practiculy in tears. "It broke my little ole heart."
 .........AS BUNNIE REFERS TO ME AS HOW YOU SAY 'LITTLE OLE ANT' I 
HAVE FOUND SHE IZ RIGHT. I'M WORTHLESS. I RESIGN FROM THE FREEDOM 
FIGHTERS......
  "Bunnie, Antoine would never admit he was 'Little Ole Ant' it's 
just not an Ant thing to do.


To be continued.......

Yes, but other than fan-fic and the comics, there's not much to say.
I myself haven't had time to read the latest 3 or so stories (and to be 
honest, if they're as depressing as Bloodlines (sorry, Dan), I'm in no 
hurry to _make_ time)...

Where were you (and everybody else) when I posted my comments on #29?
Either everybody agreed with them, or didn't care enough to reply, or they 
haven't gotten their copies yet...

And another one for _you_: when are you going to finish "Other Sonics"?
I still chuckle at that comment of yours in the Foreword:

>But what are these other realms like?  What are the others like in them? 
>Is Bunnie always such a babe in them (Sorry, that just slipped out)?

So where's the rest?  :^)

Well, you don't have to worry about `Ring of Truth' being depressing.
It's weird, it sounds like a bad B-movie at times, but it's not depressing.
(And I'm working on another one, no less.)

I haven't ever picked up a StH Archie comic yet.  I got into the fandom by
the StH series, and the WWW page I found on day wandering around randomly.
But since they seem to be pretty good (by what I've heard), I think I'll
look into picking a few up.

Perhaps that topic deserves another list entirely...  ;)

Yeah!  =)

There are three ways you can get them. One - go anywhere that 
sells Archie comics. It's a sure bet that if you see Archie and 
his gang, you will also find Sonic, too. I suggest Waldenbooks
or B. Dalton or at a convience store, or wherever.
	Two - if you get an issue, subscribe directly to Archie
comics. They always have a deal where 13 comics go for $15 (not
including S&H).
	Three - if you deside you like it, you can order or find
back issues. You can get them either from Archie comics or Toys
R' Us. Archie comics sells them for aprox. $1.50 each. Toys 'R
Us sells two issues for $2.
	I hope you decide you like these comics. I sure do. ;-)

OK
Just got the first part of the Tail's series. (OK so I'm
late) Just wanted to make a few comments,

*spoilers?*

The writers need to take a back seat to the artists. 
Tail's is way to wordy, expressing every thought or
idea (is a way too dramatic self narration) rather than
let a picture of a action tell the tale.

The first two pages made me think they had everyone WAY
off model, then I realized that it was Tail's own drawings
we were seeing, and of course Tail draws like  10 year old. :-)
Interesting view of Sally, though. 

Hated to see the Seafox go, kinda strange they decided to
junk it so early.

Didn't care for the undersea freedom fighters. They don't
fit in too well. I like it better with the freedom fighters
be few and far between in small cells. These just seemed
to convenient, though I did like the way they saved Tails
from drowning as a flashback rather, made the drowning of

And this time... They're in color. :-)

ftp://rat.org/pub/sonic/images/comic/

fleetw06.jpg thru fleetw17.jpg are the new color ones.

fleetw01.jpg though fleetw05.jpg are the old B&W scans.

I think the artwork is a hell of a lot better than Archie, but Tails is a
little too red for me.

Sometimes unfortunately, to keep the plot moving, I would suspect that

And yet, as it's shown so clearly below, this story would probably start
*before* the second season, unless we assume that the comic has a bit of a
different continuity, and The Doomsday Project will never occur in this
timeline.........

>Well, I see they know how to give green eyes to _somebody_ (namely, Dulcy).
>Now if only they'd get Bunnie's right...

Not to mention the lower half of her body. As they brought in Dulcy *as is*
from the show for which I'm forever grateful, and the Archie people saw fit
to change  their first two attempts at Sally to the one we all know and love
from the show, why do these guys have such a sticking point on Bunnie with
robotisizing her waist and that cute little bunny behind of hers? (I mean,
they're even going to be bringing Uncle Chuck in as we know him to look like
from the show) Well, I can't complain *too* much. At least she's been a
pretty full time character for the last few issues, instead of just a
background bunny, if she was to be put in the story at all as she hasn't been
for awhile. 

>And isn't it convenient that the portable de-roboticizer would have only
_one_ charge left (and of course I assume they can't figure out how to 
recharge it or anything...)

Not to mention the fact that even with all of Rotor's technical skill, along
with Sally and Tails' computer savy, they didn't first de-robotisize Uncle
Chuck or Bunnie or both, (couldn't they have just stood together under the
ray?) and then taken the thing apart to see what exactly made it tick so that
they could have built more of the little godsends to have in reserve before
attempting something so risky as what Sally did, and ended up losing the
de-robotisizor in the first place, ending up back at square one. I know they
needed a plot, but as I always look for the logic, this one had a few holes
to deal with (I also find it a little too convienient that 1) A derobotisizor
would pop up at all. Why would Robotnik need such a thing? Time off for good
behavior for one of the robotisized animals (cheap shot, and a sick joke I
know. Sorry.)? 2) That a Robotisizor would be a large, telephone booth sized
contraption that would probably weigh a couple of tons, yet the derobotisizor
is this little hand held gizmo that Ducly could stuff in her pouch, or Sonic
in his backpack with ease. A bit of a reach to make that plot work, no?

>I'll let somebody else comment on how Antoine was holding Bunnie...

Agreed.

>Why should Sally have volunteered to be roboticized when Uncle Chuck's 
already there?  Or was this story set before he had regained his will? 
(Maybe the next issue will clarify this - Uncle Chuck's on the cover...)  
While I appreciate the comic's move towards the Sat. AM Sonic, I wish they'd 
note how it fits into the continuity, sort of like the Gargoyles comic is 
doing (or at least _was_ doing) with respect to the daily show.

I wish they would as well. 

>I don't know whether to be glad or disappointed at them not showing Sally's
roboticization - by not doing so, they spare us a possibly horrific sequence;
but OTOH this might have given the story even more drama...  

Very true. As disappointed as I was with the plot holes I mentioned, it *was*
a good story, and it would have been more dramatic (as I like a story to be)
with seeing Sally robotisized. All I know is when I saw that cover pic, I got
one hell of a feeling of horror. <shiver!> That cover was one creepy piece of
fantastic art!

>And of course
the widget that was supposed to preserve her free will "fell off" during the 
process - again, how convenient.  Why didn't Rotor clip it to her or 
something?  (Or even stick it _in_ her ear?)

Here's another surpising thing. From what we know, you can't robotisize
something that's already robotisized. Ie: You can't turn something from flesh
to metal, if it's already metal. Now. With this in mind, once that
Robotisizor ray hit Sally, why didn't  the "Free will" disc blow up? If the
writers forgot this, a good thing that the disc fell off, no? The explosion
wouldn't have been all that great, but even so.... <especially if Rote had
put it in a better place. Surprising that Sal herself didn't think of this
potential risk when she volunteered for this mission, considering what she
did to sabotage Robotnik as we saw in her mini series>(if I'm missing
something for which the FW disc wouldn't have blown up for some logical
reason, then in her ear would indeed have been a good place to put it. ) I'm
also surprised that since the disk, should have blown up, Sally and Rote
didn't consider the plan a bust before trying it, as there would have been no
way for that Disc to give Sally back her will....

>Odd that the process preserved all of Sally's coloring...

Indeed, while Bunnie just gets a cold steel gray, while she isn't even a grey
hare! (Insert rim shot wav..)

>And while they at least showed _some_ struggle on Sally's part to obey 
Robotnik while roboticized, given her intense feelings for the Freedom 
Fighters (and presumably Sonic), I'd've thought she'd've struggled a bit 
harder and longer (maybe we can blame it on the shock of being 
roboticized)...

Well in "Ultra Sonic" it took a power ring for Uncle Chuck to come out of his
"programming" the first time, and he has feelings just as intense for the FF.
I thinnk Sally did okay that she had any free will left at all!

>But the art by Mawhinney and Koslowski was excellent as usual...

I wonder what Spaza would have done with it though......... (I wasn't at all
disappointed in the art though. Loved it in fact!)

>The fan art isn't too shabby this time out (fanboys check out Sally's 
outfit); but I wouldn't think Bunnie and Sally are into tattoos and pierced 
ears, 

Nor  I . Fans have some *pretty strange* concepts of the FF for them to be
drawing this stuff. Still, there are those alt worlds along the cosmic
interstate that they could be drawing these sketches from....... "Biker Babes
from Mobius!" <G> (Forgive me, Girls!)

>and Bunnie's _left_ arm is the robot one, not her right...

Exactly.

>Now onto the Tails story:

>That was a rather lame escape by Tails: using fur from his tails to clog up
the roboticizer???  They didn't look too threadbare after he got out, and I
would think anything that could handle a whole two-tailed fox could handle 
whatever loose fur he could shake off...

As far as Tails' tails not looking too threadbare, perhaps he's a really good
shedder? ;) Seriously though, it was a lame escape, unless he was somehow
able to throw that extra fur from his Tails into a vent where it *did* clog
up the air system for the machine. 

>I also find it hard to believe Tails' tails are strong enough for him to 
pull out a mechanical tree by the roots and swing it like a golf club (but 
it was still amusing :^)).

Agreed. And yet, as David Bruce Banner demonstrated to the world for years
and years, (The Incredible Hulk to all you who've never picked it up) there's
no telling what one is capable of, in a fitted pique of emotion, particularly
*anger*.....
(Wonder how many FF Tails could fly out of danger in one shot if he really
needed to? He could be as good as Dulcy! )

>That bit about "robbing me of my _innocence_" was a bit much - at the risk
of getting a bit crude, just how realistic _was_ that Fiona automaton?  

Not to mention that with that explanation in mind, this is still a children's
book by all accounts....;)

>(And 
note that the letter column for this issue has a quasi-explanation for Tails 
being 10 not 5, but 10 is still a bit young for this sort of thing, isn't it?
Or do Mobians hit puberty quicker than we do?)  And again, Tails' comment 
about "my lost youth" was a bit overdramatic; while it may be true, I doubt 
most people recognize the loss of their youth *when it happens* - I'd say it
takes years for it to sink in (and for us toon fans, maybe it never does
:^)).

I agree wholeheartedly. The explanation about Tails' age was quite lame
(sounded like D.C.'s attempt at merging all the multi universes). If they're
going to be basing the comic from here on in on the Sat A.M. series, why
don't they just *do* it, (Lose that crabmeat character) start over from the
ish where Sally from the show first appeared (Ish #16 I think, while still
keeping important issues like "This island Hedgehog" in the continuity.) and
say that Tails is ten years old through nothing else but the natural action
of ol father time (and the timekeeper with his timestones of course. <G>) The
"Lost innocence" and "lost youth" bit, was quite out of character for Tails.
He's only Ten, and he's talking more dramatically than Sally was in her
miniseries! Come on people! Match age to appropriate dialogue, would ya?

>And another cliche: the nearly-instantly-rusting-out-when-wet-robot; I
could've believed a short-circuit, but not rust.  And I don't know whether 
to applaud Fiona's final tear as a nice touch, or sneer at it as yet another 
predictable cliche...

Indeed. I really found the whole part of Tails' reaction to Fiona's betrayal
to be the worst part of this story, and I *really* wish that they hadn't done
the story this way, or at least they could have chosen it as a story on it's
own that I could have convieniently and gratefully forgotten about, instead
of having it lead into the miniseries, which I'm really looking forward to.
If this story was just one of those not so great short one-shot stories that
seem to come about every so often, then I would have been okay with it, but
now it's a part of the larger continuity........*sigh*. 
I mean, Tails was with this robot girl for one day or so we can assume,  and
already he's so in love with her, that he outright denies the fact that she's
a robot? She's trying to kill him, and he keeps coming back with "Don't do it
Fiona! You love me!"? GAG! Spare me! And then the whole "I'll make him fix
you and then we'll be together again." Oh please! (First off, if she's simply
rusted, why don't you just get some of that oil from your crankcase that you
<*snicker*> filled up from that oiled seagull? (I know from videos of the
Alaskan oil spill that those birds get a lot of oil in their feathers, but
not enough to fill a crankcase for a sub!)) 
And second of all, *hel-o-hoooo!* Tails? Anybody home? I've heard of a girl
stealing your heart and mind, and even your common sense and logic, but this
is rediculous! Are you so desperate for companionship that you deny that this
girl is not a flesh and blood being? Yes this does bring up arguments of how
a robot could perhaps grow to full or near sentience, (The Vision from "The
Avengers", who was married after all to a mutant ie: The Scarlet
Witch,....Then there's Data from ST:TNG, who did pretty good in his personal
growth before getting his full range of emotions in "Generations" with that
chip...and of course, most recently there's EVE....), and how a person could
grow to love a being that isn't flesh and blood, but I really don't think
that Fiona has had any time (considering her behavior) to evolve any, like
the other mechanical being's I've listed. After all, there's no guarantee
that she would anyway, unless Robotnik had incorporated some of the "self
awareness and adaptability programs from his EVE schematics into Fiona and
the other robots he created.......hmmm.....I'm suddenly beginning to be
reminded of "Batman:The Animated Series" with the ep: "His silicon soul..."
Batman (To Alfred about his robotic duplicate) : "Could it have had a soul
alfred? A soul of silicon, but a *soul* nonetheless?"
Still, even with this possibility, as I've said, I don't think with Fiona's
behavior, at the moment, this possibility took place. (I'm kinda marveling
here how I suddenly switched positions from flaming a story that made no
sense and was dumb, to musing about a story, if they had explained it a bit
more, would've had some good posibilities......)

>Finally, with the part with the tear in Fiona's eye at the end, some may
think it cliche, some may think it touching, but considering that Fiona
showed *no* repeat, *NO* remorse or hesitancy about trying to robotisize or
strangle, or drown our favorite young fox, the only thing that I can think
of, is that her sheded tear was for the fact that she failed in her mission
to Robotnik to destroy the young "mongrel" (as Robotnik put it.) I'll admit
that I *did* like the scenes of Tails being in love with Fiona (strange
though that as a protector of the environment, Tails would do an act of
vandalism like carving his and Fiona's initials on a living tree.....), but
unless we see *some* evidence of Fiona developing a soul as I've mentioned, I
hope that this is last we see of Fiona, and that Tails in the meantime, can
find another love on his own in the miniseries with one of the Freedom
fighters "down under".  With Fiona coming back and joining the FF as some of
the other posters to this list have said, well, it would be nice, but only if
they have it make sense. Maybe you could pass these comments on down to the
editor, Paul old pal?

One last note on this story that I have just *got* to say, is thus: Did this
this whole story remind *anyone else* besides me (through overdramatics and
stupidity (at certain points) to the point of it being comedy) of the Bugs
Bunny Cartoon where Bugs gets lured to the lair of an Evil Scientist by a
cute little robotic bunny that he finds to be as such later on. Then, when
the ES (Hmmm...Eric Shwartz? <G>) and the monster (Rudolph) are defeated,
Bugs says in overdramatic fashion....
Bugs: "And soooo, having re-*re* disposed of the monster......" 
(At this point, another mechanical Bunny babe (the first one was destroyed
earlier in the short) goes walking by and gives him a comes hither look....) 
Bugs (to audience, giving them a confident and calmly knowing look as he
hooks a thumb over toward the babe): It's mechanical. 
(Bunnybabe give Bugs a smooch on the cheek at this point, dazing Bugs before
walking off camera) 
Bugs: (regaining himself and speaking to audience in a near frenzy of
emotion) SO?!!...<shrug> IT'S MECHANICAL!!! (With this, Bugs starts off in
earnest, walking in lovesick robot fashion toward bunnybabe off camera). I
can't help laughing at the similarity. Well, here's hoping that "notes from
the net" starts up again so I can put at least some of my critiques to good
use....

>But the art by Manak and Harvo was fairly good; Tails really did look 
half-dead when Fiona was about to dunk him for the third time (although he 
seemed to make a typical toonish quick recovery from it :^)).

Agreed. They couldn't have showed him crawling up onto shore? When Tails had
gotten whipped by Sonic in the last issue, he didn't get up again as soon as
he hit the floor....

>  I hope they 
do as good a job in the Tails miniseries...

Personally, I hope they do a better job. If its as good as or better than
Princess Sally's first mini series (from "In your face" and the three
previous connecting stories from the back issues before it) with the emotions
it drew out, I'll be a writing some praises in the mail once more...

>Tidbits from the letters page: I'll let Dan Drazen flame the continuing 
office humor; Dylan is revealed to be a porcupine (then why didn't they name 
him Patrick or Percy or something?); 

What's wrong with Dylan?

>Antoine is said to be 18 (then isn't 
Sally a bit young for him?  But he sure doesn't _act_ 18...); 

In the show, Ant is the same age as everyone else. Why would they say he's 18
here? They lost me on this one.

>and Boomer was 
a former nickname for Rotor supposedly because of his voice (O-kayyyy...).

::Echo::

>I suppose all the above seems a bit harsh; I'll confess I've been in a bit
of a bad mood this weekend due to various things (not having a life being 
part of them), but I still think the observations above are valid. 

I know that my own comments were a bit harsh in some places, but I'll make no
claim to being in a bad mood. If I see holes, I'm gonna point em out. 

>Also, 
I'd rather have flawed stories like the above that at least try to live up 
to the Sat. AM Sonic, then the lame ones of the earlier days that weren't
much better than the daily shows.

Agreed. Something that's good though flawed in spots, is better than not
having something good at all....(an ironic comment if you think about it,
since we don't have new eps of the show while drek has grown on ABC in it's
place...).

Don't forgot Robotnik also has the technology from the replicants appearing

To my knowledge, the only Sonic games are those from Sega (and listed in 
the Merchandise List), unless you include MUCK's.

I'm sure there would be interest in a Sonic RPG one could play on their 
system, but you should probably get clearance from Sega even if you plan 
to make the game freeware.

Or you can join in on FurToonia.  Several list subscribers have a 
character there, as do the list owners.  Bring up 
telnet://red_panda.tbyte.com:9999/ .  BTW, my primary character has 
nothing to do with Sonic, but a few subscribers/FT'ers have met my 
"puppet" from the Archie comics.

Please make any further inquiries about FT in private e-mail or in 
alt.fan.furry.muck instead of the Sonic list.

I know that no Sonic RPG video games exist.  The reason for this is that 
some folks in Marketing don't seem to believe role-playing games make good 
sellers.  But the truth is, ANY type of game done correctly will sell (IF it 
has advertising support).

If you folks want to see a Sonic RPG for the Sega Saturn, I would encourage 
you to check out the Sega WWW site (www.segaoa.com) and write your request 
to the Webmaster.  If we get enough demand... Who knows?  :)

I was going to run a "Sonic: The Next Generation" PBEM a bit back, using 
Toon rules, before life got in the way.  If people are still interested, 
I'll dust off the stats and relaunch it.

In response to statements that the FAQ File has become too much of a
good thing, I'm going to try a cut-and-paste posting approach.  I guess
I'll let the custodians of Sonic home pages which carry the file worry
about keeping the whole thing available.

Frequently Asked Questions

10) Why was Rotor called "Boomer" in the early comics?
They finally got around to providing an answer to this one in Sonic #29
(Dec 1995).  The explanation: "Rotor is Rotor's real name.  Boomer was
something we used to call him when we were kids to make fun of his
voice."  So basically we're supposed to believe "Boomer" is really
Rotor's nickname.

=======================================================================

#29 [Dec 1995]
     [Better double-bag this one, gang; it's a keeper for a
number of reasons.  DJD]
     Cover by Spaziante -- this stunning work alone deserves
recognition!  Not as powerful as the roboticization of Sally
sequence in "Sonic's Nightmare" but close enough.
     "Steel-belted Sally" (three parts)
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney
     After a one-page introduction to Dulcy (which was more than
she got when she debuted in the second season), we move on to the
story.  Sonic finds a "portable deroboticizer"(!!!) in a crashed
hover unit.  So Rotor takes it apart, figures out how it works,
begins mass-producing them, the residents of Mobius are
deroboticized and they drive Robotnik off the planet.  Wrong
answer!  Instead, Sally allows herself to be captured by Robotnik
and roboticized, trusting in a small disc that looks like a
battery for a calculator that's supposed to prevent her mind from
coming under Robotnik's influence after being roboticized. 
Unfortunately, the "neuro-overrider" falls off and Sally is
totally transformed.  As the others are on the verge of being
roboticized by Robo-Sally, Dulcy shows up and uses the portable
deroboticizer (remember THAT plot device?) to restore Sally and
foil Robotnik.
     Good artwork by Mawhinney, but readers have been quick to
point out the flaws in the plot of the story.  Why NOT use the
portable deroboticizer to restore Bunnie, or even Uncle Chuck
(scheduled to appear in issue #30)?  After it's used on Sally
it's never heard of again; shabby treatment for a pivotal device. 
And why wasn't the neuro-overrider more securely fastened to
Sally?  They couldn't find a bobby pin?  They never heard of
super glue?  They couldn't take the time to surgically implant
the thing?  And finally, whose idea was it at Archie Comics to
have Bunnie wearing metallic panties?  Her legion of fanboys are
glad she's putting in more of an appearance, but how about
keeping her on-model?
     Sonic Art: Reid Price's drawing of the girls elicited some
comment because of the tattoos and pierced ears.  Still a pale
imitation of the erotic "Bambioids" of Jerry Collins which are at
ftp://avatar.snc.edu/pub/furry/images/downloads/j/jc[001 through
108].gif.  Of this collection I am in awe.
     "Growing Pains, Part 2"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
     When we last left Tails, he had been betrayed by his new
girlfriend, Fiona, who turned out to be one of Robotnik's
automatons.  Tails has just been consigned to the desert island's
roboticizer.  Fasten your safety belts, return seats and tray
tables to their upright position and assume the crash landing
position: a promising story is about to go down in flames....
     The roboticizer explodes because of "fur from [Tails']
tails."  Wonder why this problem never came up when Robotnik was
roboticizing other furries; next time, Ivo, don't put your
prisoners in the air intake.  Fiona attacks Tails, who is then
almost crushed boa-style by one of Robotnik's palm trees.  Fiona
attacks again and attemps to drown Tails in the shallows. 
However, before she can finish the job she grinds to a halt. 
Apparently she is able to rust solid in a matter of seconds. 
Tails should have noticed this little problem when he and Fiona
were running along the beach during the romantic interlude on
page 5 of Part 1, but maybe Tails and Gallagher both learned
story structure and continuity from the same teacher.  While
Tails mourns his lost (or at least immobilized) love in
unbelievably heavy-handed prose, Robotnik escapes.  Tails may be
blue, but he's also green: he starts picking up the trash along
the beach.  This is how he discovers "absolute proof" that O.J.
Simpson murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman...oops, wrong
story.  What he discovers is "absolute proof" of a "satellite
operation functioning on the other side of Mobius."  Same level
of credibility, IMHO.  Having been handed the premise of his
miniseries on a silver plate without any connection whatever to
the two-parter he just endured, Tails is off on his solo
adventure.
     This isn't Shakespeare, Heaven only knows...it isn't even
Bacon, but Tails' acting in this story is 100% ham!  In writing
for comics you have to take shortcuts, and sometimes you have to
put massive amounts of plot development into a couple of word
balloons.  "Growing Pains", however, manages to wade through 15
pages before setting up the plot of the miniseries on the very
last page.  Which wouldn't be so unforgivable if the dialogue
that preceeded it weren't so extravagent.  "I'll put you here as
a monument to my lost youth...but I'll make him repair you and
we'll be together again, my love!"  Typical 10-year-old, right?  
     OK, when did you totally give up on this story?  I managed
to hang in until page 7.  When I got to the line "Robotnik
created the perfect woman, but forgot to waterproof her!", I knew
this was the cue for Sonic's line: "I think I shall hurl!"
     What galls me is the promise with which the story began. 
It's easy to tell the Trekkers in the audience because after Part
1 they've been rooting for Fiona to switch allegiances and join
up with Tails (call it the Mr. Data Effect).  The questions
raised by Part 1 were full of promise: Will Fiona cross over and
join the Freedom Fighters?  Did Tails get to second base with
Fiona during their romantic interlude?  The readers were ready to
grant Gallagher and Manak a lot of latitude in the beginning, but
the second part was a total bringdown.  The traps were
unbelievable, Fiona was written out of the story too easily, and
Tails was stuck with some of the most melodramatic lines this
side of Yiddish theater.  And by the last page you had the sense
of "Forget it, let's get on to the miniseries."  With more
thought to the story, "Growing Pains" could have been a decent
miniseries in its own right, ending with a Tails whose character
has actually grown by the end of the story.  It's a bad sign when
the readers take the story more seriously than the writer!
     Sonic Grams: For the last time, guys, LOSE THE OFFICE HUMOR! 
We buy the product so we can read about Sonic and Tails, not
Scott and Paul.  Buried in Scott's prose is the news that despite
the Spaziante covers, the team who perpetrated "Growing Pains",
Gallagher and Manak, will be doing the Tails miniseries!  So much
for anticipation.  Can you say "coherency?"  More important, can
you DO coherency?  November promises Sonic #30 and the return of
Uncle Chuck, Tails miniseries #2, and the Knuckles Chaotix
special, just in time for your holiday shopping.
     On to the letters themselves, and these stuck in my craw
even more than the flaws in "Growing Pains."  First they punt a
question on whether Tails is 5 or 10 years old, then they run a
letter to Dylan, then they casually mention that Antoine is 18
(without offering any proof that he's older than the rest), and
even though they go some ways in explaining the Boomer/Rotor name
game they have to deal with a question about Sonic and Robotnik
being half-sibs.  Two words: PUH-LEEEZE!

-> I'm sure there would be interest in a Sonic RPG one could play on
-> their system, but you should probably get clearance from Sega even if
-> you plan to make the game freeware.

Well I will break the scilence. I was reading up on a program called
Inform and am planing on writeing a sonic Text Adventure (More like an
Interactive Story) that whould be somewhat easy to finish. and yes you
can get killed in it! Inform the program that I whould use to compile it
if I ever did write it is simalar to a system that made games for the
famus Infocom co. Games like  Zork,Hitchhiker's guide and Planetfall to
name a few. The point is It will be freeware but if I give all credit do
I need to still get premission from sega?

Let me know

PS. The good part is that the data file the .z5 file which is the game
itself can be played on any computer as long as you have an interprater
for it.

If you saw your own message on the list, it was sent out by the mail 
server.  In extreme cases, it could take 4 days for a list message to 
reach a subscriber.  Delivery time is affected by the locations of the 
mail server and subscriber, and also by how big the mailing list is.  It 
normally takes less time for a reply to traverse the net but >1 day does 
happen.  Occasionally, messages do get lost -- but that's an infrequent 
event.

>From Sonic The Hedgehog,

	After having a pretty hectic week, I have finally put up three
pictures for all to view:  they may be found at rat.org's ftp site.

	Sonic&Miles.jpg : a picture taken from the comic book and 
renovated for more better color clarity and sharpness.  Enjoy, everyone!

	TailsNew2.Jpg : A way past cool picture of our fave. Orange fox 
doing the classic wave.  Notice the sonic sneakers are on. :^) This 
picture was hand drawn by yours truly and inked with india ink and 
scanned and polished in Photoshop and uploaded.  Enjoy!

	SonicandTails.jpg : This is hand drawn then inked in with india 
ink.  My artwork has considerably improved since the heydays, thanks to 
my friend who helped me learn how to use india ink properly.  Color is 
supplied by Photoshop again.  Its of Sonic and Tails posing.  Tails is 
smirking at Sonic while Sonic does his WAY PAST COOL thumbs up.

	One more new picture will be posted soon.  keep your eyes out for 
it, Tails fans!  ITs gonna knock all of your socks off!  ;^)

						From the coolest hedgehog,
						Bryant "Sonic" Melesko
						Sonic The Hedgehog
http://www.grcom.com/sonic4

P.S.: Please feel free to send feedback to me regarding the pictures and 
how I can improve on them.  I am going to draw more sonic and tails 
pictures as soon as midterm week clears up.

Must be something about comic book characters and water.  Remember the
X-Men ish where Rogue dives in the pool, which is frozen by Ice Man, and
then in the next frame her hair's back to its normal fluffy nature?

True, which gives me a GREAT story idea...why didn't they send Bunnie
instead of Sally?  I mean, you COULD say "Robotnik's not THAT stupid", but
OTOH, he was stupid enough to let Sonic live in #27 when he had a chance to
kill him...

I have placed a new sound on the ftp site.

ftp://rat.org/pub/sonic/sounds/so-diff.zip

This sound is Sonic saying, "Why does everything have to be so difficult?".
It is a 8-bit mono 22kHz .WAV recorded on a SB16 card under Warp 3 MMOS/2.

Archie Sonic #30 is out...

I just never have the time to go and do full-blown reviews of these any
more but in this episode we see the return of Uncle Chuck.  Its very 
unlike the Sat-AM version so we've definitly on a different 'time line'
here. :)

For some reason Archie artists draw Chuck the same shade of blue as Sonic.
They also draw the eyes as blue on a while background as opposed to the
cartoon's red with black background.  I think I like the red and black
better.

We also get to see what kinds of evil schemes Snively comes up with when
not held down by Robotnik.

We also get a quick story involving the badnik 'Coconuts'... We also get some
good views of Robotnik's teeth..

That's all I'll say about the story.

In Sonic-Grams there was only room for one letter (long letter w/ long 
reply)... Here's some things we might see in upcoming issues according to
the reply:

* We'll something something like' a Mecha-Knuckles soon.
* It doesn't happen often but Sonic will become Super Sonic again and
  join up with Hyper Knuckles in an upcoming issue.
* Geoffery St. John and the rebel underground will make a brief appearence
  in Knuckles Chaotix.
* Amy Rose will come back one of these days.
* The identity of the mysterious stranger in the Knuckles stories will 
  be revealed in Knuckles solo-stories in issues 31-33.

And I've still not seen my copy of #29 in the mail.  I guess I'll have to 
see if I can still find it locally.  I'm getting to wonder what my

Funny, I was thinking of subscribing. Have you been unhappy with the service?
If it ends up being late all the time, I'd just as soon buy it at the
newsstand.

Here are two Sonic storys I am working on. they have the same title 
but don't be confused.
One is meant to be a continuation of From Amy Rose, with Love
The other story features Knuckles. 

I need imput on these storys, because I have no idea what should 
happen next.
Also, I plan on changing the name of the Knuckles story, this name is 
just a 'promo'

Here they are!


By Lindsay Cibos-

Prologue (continued from "From Amy Rose, with Love)

 "I'm sorry I slapped you Sonic." Sally started, "I'm going out with 
Antoine now. He's a prince.
Anyway I think we should see other animals."
  "I guess so." Sonic said. A tear formed in his eye.
  "Comeon my princez." Antoine said, he smiled.
Sally smiled. She took Antoines hand.
  "Antoine....yes."Sally said, her words full of meaning.
Sonic glared at Antoine.
 Antoine smiled and slid the ring on Sally's hand.
They held hands as they walked off into the sunlight.


To Be Or Not To Be
Chapter One

THE NEXT DAY.....
Antoine slid out of bed slowly.  Antoine opened his eyes,and saw 
Sonic. Sonic had an angry look on his face.  Antoine fell out of bed. 

   "ECKKK!" Antoine screamed.  
  "Yo, Shut-up Ant. You want to wake everybody?!" Sonic said. A red 
hand-print wear Princess
Sally slapped Sonic was still visable. Sonic wore  green boxers. He 
looked like he was angry, but the way he told Antoine to shut-up, it 
was clear that he was not mad at Antoine, he was mad at Sally.
  "Whatz to youz want?" Antoine said, wide awake now.
  "It's Tails! He's gone! I woulda' gone to someone else, but they 
went on a mission. The only ones left are supposed to be Bunnie, Amy-
Rose, and Tails.
  "Thank-you so much for you're ze encoragement" Antoine said. He 
then quickly got dressed and they went outside. "I thought you 
mightze want to knowz that me and my mon-sherie,Sally iz ouw you zay, 
engaded. Pleasez excuse my french."
  "Is that a joke Antoine?" Sonic asked.
  "No joke,me an ze Sally iz en-" Antoine started, but Sonic 
interupted.
  "Not that 'twain! The part about "Excusing your french"
  "I am ze french, am I not?" Antoine said, now becoming confused.
  "Never mind Ant."
They walked towards Tails hut. When they got there, Sonic pointed out 
that there was no sign of struggle, and no sign that Tails had ran 
away. The only possible thing Tsils could have done was followed the 
others on the mission. A top secret mission that is.
  "Sonic, I zay we not worries about Tails. He's probally fine, no?"
  "No."
  "Sonic,trust me." 

THIS IS THE SECOND ONE.

To Be or not to Be
Chapter One

Knothole II on the floating island.....
  "Knuckles, this is the last straw!!!!,"Espio yelled.
  "Why? What did I do?!," Knuckles asked the chameleon. She turned 
her back to him. Vector leaned back in his chair at the meeting table,
 studying a map of the island. There were several circles on the map 
where they had spotted Mecha Sonic. He had his legs proped up on 
another chair. He had an odd smile on his face, like he was HAPPY 
about the argument that was taking place.....
  "I saw you with that 'Princess Sally'! You kissed her, you know tha-
"
  "She kissed me!! It was a kiss on the check! Besides you and me are 
not going together! Thats why I didn't conplain when you kissed 
Vector." Knuckles glares at Vector. The crocodile simply shrugs; in 
such a way as saying 'leave me out of this'.
  "Listen you two, drop it. We have much more IMPORTANT things to 
worry about, like finding Mecha, he has the chaos emerald after all!  
The floating island IS still falling!! Worry about personal matters 
later!,"Vector screamed. Charmy Bee flew into the hut and almost 
knocked Vector over. "GeEz! Whats YOUR promblem, lil' bee?" 
  "You're right! There are more important things to do!" Knuckles 
said.
  "Charmy!," Espio called,"Find Sonic. You are the only one who can 
get there the fastest. Tell him to- er here," Espio wrote out a note 
for Sonic to read. Charmy Bee couldn't speak and that was a major 
weakness for him. She handed the note to Charmy Bee. He looked it 
over, and gave her a quick thumbs up. Charmy Bee flew out of the room.

  "What should I do?," Mighty the Armadillo asked Knuckles. He paced 
around the room.
  "Hmmmm. You and Alisa go evacuate the island. Heres the parachutes 
for everyone. Oh! Heres two for you guys,"  
The chipmunk and the Armadillo gave Knuckles a thumbs up. Knuckles 
threw them the parachutes. They held hands as they left.
  "Well?,"Vector asked.
  "Me and Espio will go hunt down Mecha. I think we will have an 
easier time finding him if we split up."
  "What about me?"
  "You will stay here and wait for Sonic and the other freedom 
fighters."
  "Sigh. I always get stuck with the boring stuff!"


Chapter 2
......AND BRING SOME POWER RINGS. 

As Sonic read this, he looked troubled. The lil' waited for Sonic to 
respond. Sonic handed Charmy his note back, and sat down at the end 
of the bridge, the bee mimicing what Sonic did. They dangled their 
legs off the end of the bridge, undistrubed, thinking. Bunnie broke 
the peace. She came running up to Sonic, and almost tripped on Charmy,
 which would have resulted in her falling into the lake.

  "SONIC! Little ole Ant left this note" Bunnie said. She was 
practiculy in tears. "It broke my little ole heart."

         I have how you say, decided to quit the Freedom Fighters.  
         I've met those who treat me better- ANTOINE 

   "Good riddins!" Sonic said with a laugh. 
   "SONIC! How could you say that? Ah mean the Sugah-fox has some 
good points!"
   "Like?" Sonic crossed his arms.
   "Um"
   "I see."
   "Who would treat Antoine better?"
   "WHO CARES?" Sonic said, rolling his eyes.
 The Bee thrashed his arms in the air, trying to get some attention. 
Bunnie and Sonic both looked down at him. Charmy handed the note for 
Bunnie to read.
    "Sonic, get a power ring." Sonic stood up obediantly and put out 
his hand over the water, just in time for the power ring to float up.

Charmy and Bunnie grabbed hold of Sonic.

To be continued.......

I don't know how many of you on the list went to ConFURence East just 
recently in New Jersey... but didn't it seem really funny but COOL that 
they had LOTS and LOTS of Sonic comics?  They had issues #28, 29 and 30 as 
well as #1 of the TAILS comic and #1 of IN YOUR FACE.  :)

Sonic & Co. are invading the furry fandom!!!  @Wheeee!!!  :)

They always reach me well after they hit the newsstands in my area.  I 
would guesstimate by 10-20 days, but in hindsight, I wish I had been 
taking notes.  Unfortunately, the comics are a pain to find locally, so I 
was hoping a subscription would save me from having to go running all 
over town every month.  It's even harder for me to get the "Animaniacs" 
comic locally, but that's another show.

It also took quite a while to get Sally #1, but I may have been the first 
on the list to get Sally #2.  Or I was the first to post anything about 
Sally #2.  Other orders seem to arrive slowly but surely.

I had nothing in my mailbox this afternoon.  Maybe #29 will be waiting 
for me tomorrow.  But then again, maybe not.

Well, I got my copy of Issue #29 in the mail...of course, since I hadn't
gotten it earlier, I'd assumed my subscription hadn't been processed yet,
so I'd been out and bought it at the comix shop anyway.  Go figure.

Glad to see you've finally gotten on the list, Amaroq.  FINALLY my nagging
does something!  Anyways, as to what you said...

>     The "late comics" deal only seems to be with Archie.

That's odd...I had a subscription to X-Men for a while, and those came in
later than the ones at the newsstand, too...of course, they didn't come as
late as Archie's.

Hello.  I'm David Gonterman and I've been on America On-Line for over two 
months now.  During that time, I've been writing what I call a 
continuation of the STH SatAM cartoon entitled 'Blood and Metal.'  It's 
becomming very popular on the cartoon Bulitin Boards on AOL.

I'm writing on the fifth episode right now.  I also have the entire story 
available on the World Wide Web.  The URL address is 
[http://users.aol.com/dgonterman/home/htm]

Well, that's all I've got to say for right now.  I've gotta catch up to 
date on the messages here (First, I've gotta read the FAQ sheet on this 
system.  Does anobody know where I can get it?)

For a Free Mobius and all that jazz.

David Gonterman  (DGonterman@aol.com)

Well, it's pretty undoubted that there aren't many visitors to my site...I
don't even NEED a usage counter; I'm probably the only one who ever uses
it!  Anyhoo, I'm trying to fix it up to make it worth my time and
yours...you might want to check it out about once a week, cuz I change it
about that often.  Anyway, for those of you who are too lazy to go through
the Sonic Resource Page, it's at [http://pages.prodigy.com/AZ/x/x.html].
Right now it's got a bit of information on my upcoming story, The Hunt Begins.

I can only speak for myself as to why I've yet to pay you a visit:

My office moved to a different room in the library last Wednesday (Oct
18).  Since then, the techies have discovered a million things more
important to do than hook my machine up to the net.  The only reason I
can answer this post is that I'm using a spare terminal in the Computer
Lab to check 5 days' worth of e-mail.  No WEB access, either.

As I've got two stories in active development myself, I'd be interested
in the work in progress of yours.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Do you mean you have received it by post, or has it appeared in shops in 
your area?  I have only checked 2 of my local stores so far.  One has no 
Sonic comics and the other has only #28.

>From Sonic The Hedgehog,

	Thought I would drop in on the list and ask any of you for 
comments on the latest uploads that I did to the ftp site.  If you have 
forgotten the filenames, let me know in e-mail and I'll forward u a list 
of the filenames to look at. 

	Much is appreciated always.  BTW, the in-progress Tails picture 
is still being colorized by computer and should be completed by the end 
of week hopefully!

They're `Direct Editions', beamed straight into my folder along with
my other regular orders at a franchise comic store here.  (I think
the regular newsagents are still at issue #26/27..)  The owner told
me after I came to collect Tails#1 that I'm definitely the most
eclectic reader in the area. :)

Is Tails#1 the first time that Manak has drawn Sally with the
`Mawhinney' vest?  I liked the Wing Dingoes (I've heard that
somewhere before..) and the Ockerified Swatbots. :)

How else thinks that the last story in Sonic#30 might have been a
big surprise planned by Mawhinney to introduce his new design for
Bunnie?  Naah, unlikely. :)

So far you came across OK.  BTW, thanx for the summaries of Sonic #30
and Tails 1/3.

Maybe I missed something in my read of the synopsis, but was the
original intent to simply send Uncle Chuck into and out of the Void?  If
so, what was THAT supposed to accomplish?  It also sounds as if the
story is based on the Gallagher miniseries to explain origins (as
opposed to the Allee/Hurst Tradition in "Blast to the Past.)"

And is it me, or does the idea of a blimp with a cloaking device that
doesn't cover the underside make no sense unless you plan on installing
it upside-down?

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Anyone else having this trouble:

I keep trying to get into the Bookshire Home Page (using Netscape 1.1)
and am consistently told that the file contains no data (or something

As far as I know, sending Sir Charles into and out of the Void was the 
original intent. As you read, later on, Robotnik was also sent into the 
Void. Perhaps he was anticipating someone sending him into the Void. So 
he must have created a failsafe, just in case (And it did happen). However, 
for the king, if you remember the Sonic second season episode, "The Void", 
when they brought back the king, he started to turn into crystal. So, to save 
his life, they had to send him back.

>And is it me, or does the idea of a blimp with a cloaking device that

Hey, Robotnik is just like a "shade-tree" mechanic - will spend $200 to 
save $5. Besides, he didn't anticipate Tails seeing through the cloak so 
quickly.

Last time I looked, it was working.  I access it all the time.  In fact, 
I'm currently working on upgrading it to include graphics and backgrounds 
and such.  Be sure you're typing in the correct address without any errors.

Well, I WOULD be here more often, except I can't be here on school

for the weekend, so (drumroll, please) I should be able to advance pretty

I guess it was, and I have no idea what it was supposed to accomplish,
unless Robotnik wants to help the Freedom Fighters by finding a way to free
creatures from the void, which I somehow find highly unlikely!  Something
tells me Snively's plot to suck all of Mobius into the void is not exactly
what Robotnik had in mind.  To quote Gestahl in Final Fantasy III: "You
fool!  If you destroy the world, we won't have anything to rule!"  (Well, I
don't think that's EXACTLY what he said, but something like it.)  I think
the best line in the whole comic was Antoine's "I am allergic to ze total destruction!"

Or in my case, as Sonic himself might say, "I'm waiting .... [foot tapping]".

I still don't have it, and I've not found it locally either.

For the record, he did not post his announcement to the list; it was only 
posted to a.f.s-h.  Another list subscriber forwarded a copy of the 
Usenet post to the list, and if not for that, I wouldn't have seen it.  I 
no longer have access to a.f.s-h on usit.net, and though I still have 
access on Nyx, expiration of articles seems to be every 24 hours.

Well, I did get my Sonic #30 in the mail, but I still haven't seen #29 
yet. I picked up a copy yesterday at 7-11, after waiting a whole month 
for it. But, knowing my luck, I will get #29 in the mail, probably, this 
week. This is not the first time this happened. 

BTW. I got Tails #1 at Waldenbooks last week, and it is great. Readers 
Beware!!! There isn't 5 pages without using atleast one bad pun in it.

I've been rethinking the strategy and [extreme ;-) mode ON] I think I've
discovered Robotnik's true weak spot:

If you're going to install a cloaking device on a flying machine (whether
heaver- or lighter-than-air), you have to assume that your greatest
concern is being seen from the ground.  That didn't occur to Robotnik,
who was more concerned about being seen from above.

Now, since the freedom fighters don't have anything like a real air
force, what could Robotnik possibly be worried about?  The only thing he
COULD be worried about, then, are small flying creatures relieving
themselves on the blimp from above (if you've ever washed a car you know
where this is leading).

And if this is indeed Robotnik's greatest fear, then we might have
stumbled upon his one weakness: GUANO!

Now, if we can only get ahold of enough fruit bats and some prunes....

Okay, you wacky StH fans, I've got two lovely stories to submit today.

The first one, `This Island Floating', is a short, pre-Doomsday tome
about an encounter between Joseph and Knuckles.  In a few words, it's a
slugfest.  It's also not my finest work; so take it with a grain of salt.
The main reasons I wrote it were because I needed a stepping stone into
`Changes', I needed to establish some vital facts about Joseph that
couldn't be fitted into the second story, and that I occasionally like to
write a slugfest just to see how I'd do on it.  (Not very well.)  Think of
it as a preface to my next adventure in creative writing.

The second story, and the beginning of my first major story arc, is called
`Changes'.  This story is much better.  In fact, it's one of the best
stories I have ever written, in my opinion.  It is also very long.  I would
have made it longer, but then I'd have to split it up, and I don't like to
do that.  So, this is the first part of a...uh, multi-part post-Doomsday 
story.  (I haven't written the rest of it yet.)  Lots of angst and cool
special effects here.

Enjoy!

Timeline:  One day before Doomsday.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

A pure, green-pigmented plain placed upon the northern continent on Mobius.
Some dried leaves fluttered in the gentle breeze, warmed by the noonday
sun.  Birds sung the ancient melody of the world, and a few non-evolved 
rabbits hopped through the shorter grass.  It was a scene beautiful enough to
melt even the most jaded heart; for on this world, scenes like that might
become rare...  

In the middle of this scene, barely visible in the high grass, was a 3 foot
tall hedgehog.  But this was not one of the usual variety of bipedal
hedgehog.  Nor was this particular hedgehog even a child of this
world; rather, he was a misplaced, genetically scrambled member of a dead
planet millions of light years from the spot where he now laid, calmly
enjoying the beauty of his new home.  This was the lot of Joseph, the
descendant of two DNA helii; his natural, Ur'thaen brand, and the current
Mobian hedgehog variety which he was experiencing now.  

However, his genetic identity crisis didn't appear to be bothering him now,
as he silently laid in the sun, soaking in the yellow star's warming rays.
The wind drifted over his motionless form as if it was a mother's gentle
movement, tucking him in for a night's rest.  A butterfly alighted on one
of his longer headquills, and slowly came to peacefully rest there.

This was paradise, Joseph thought, as he continued to simply lay there and
revel in the sublime beauty of Mobius.  He wondered why Robotnik would wish
anything like this harm.  Had he never simply walked outside on a glorious
day as this, sat down in a field, and merely admired the handiwork of
Nature?  Was all of his destruction merely due to him being a homish sort?

Nay, he pondered, Robotnik had been out in the wilderness.  He'd sit in a
field like this, take a deep breath, and think...how he'd first cut
down those trees to create housing, then drill holes in the earth for oil,
then ponder mining for precious metals...no, Robotnik could simply not
appreciate nature.  It was simply not his to appreciate this one.  Probably
all those simian genes.

But Joseph let those unpleasant thoughts leave him.  He didn't want to
think about Robotnik or Robotropolis or the damned pirated Ur'thaen 
roboticizer now.  That would only impede intuitive thought of solutions to
those problems.  Alas, he had only allotted himself only a few more days of
being au naturale before returning to Knothole and resuming work on the
deroboticization process.  He needed to value this vacation time as a
period to let his strained mind adjust to the myriad of changes that had
affected him; landing on a foreign world, finding out that he was not the
first of his kind to land here, being mutated...it made his head spin to
ponder all that had occured in only a few months.

However, Joseph realized that looking backward would only impede his
progress.  He had to overcome the obstacles placed in his path, and
continue on.  He had people to help now, so brooding wasn't going to do any
good.

But he wasn't going to think about that anymore.  No, this was a vacation,
and Joseph knew that thinking about work would only slow it down in the
long run.  So, he laid there in the field, took a deep breath, and
continued staring into the sky.  After a moment, he felt much better about
his situation again.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, a different sort of conteplation was occuring an a craft
speeding away from Robotropolis.  The sole passenger of the craft was
pondering what to say to his new friend to get him to return with him
this time.  He had still been reluctant to leave his precious island the last
time he had visited him, but he knew that he could convince him to return
with him today...

Laughter echoed through the small craft as it sped further away from the
dark outline of Robotropolis.  Soon, the short human thought, soon,
Robotnik would be out of the way; and then he, Snively the Great, could
take his rightful control over Mobius!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Eventually, Joseph grew tired of just laying in the field, thinking about
nothing.  If it's one thing his new body demanded, it was activity.  So,
he chose to get back to the activity that he had engaged in for most of
his vacation; exploring Mobius.

He had searched most of the Southern continent last week, and the Northern
continent was already throughly charted.  Perhaps he would visit the
sea again.  It was certainly beautiful enough to warrant a second look.
Besides, he had a yearning for seafood.  A boiled lobster about then seemed
mighty good.  He licked his lips and stood up.

He hadn't yet mastered the whole powering-up thing with his running.  He
always seemed to mess something up.  He'd either fall on his head, slip on
something and fall backwards, or lose control entirely and fly into a tree.
So, with some trepidation, he started running in place like Sonic did,
slowly picking up speed at first, but quickly picking up speed.  After
a few seconds of this, he took his foot off the clutch (so to speak)
and blasted forward.  

Surprisingly, he was able to maintain control of his propultion well enough
to direct himself to the shore.  Within minutes, he was able to see the
line of the horizon reflecting off the sea.  Now, he had to stop.  He
didn't particularly *like* stopping.  He had never been able to cease his
propultion on a 1 Mobian coin like Sonic did.  He had always gone up some 
extreme surface without speeding up to come to a halt.  The water was now
in plain sight.  It looked awfully blue today.  He wondered how deep--

Unconsciously speeding up, he sucessfully breached the coast, and was
suddenly running over the water.  Whoa, Joseph thought, this is cool!
He ran straight off the coast for a few minutes, and then tried a left
turn.  After sucessfully turning left, he tried turning right.  This also
was accomplished easily.  Deciding to put his navigation skills to the
test, he ran in a figure-8 a few times, and then shot off in a different
direction.  Way Past Cool, he mentally snickered, and headed off further
off the coast.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The small craft landed on the far side of an anonymous island somewhere in
the Great Ocean.  Snively departed the craft, told the SWAT Bot pilot to
maintain a holding pattern, and walked away.  As the craft took off, Snively
disappeared into the island's jungle-like foilage.

After walking on a roughly-beaten path for a while, he came to a clearing
that he had visited countless times before.  And, like every time, he 
walked over to a small stump, took a seat upon it, and waited for his
host to appear.  

"Welcome, Snively-mon," a voice said, "back to my island."

"Knuckles, cut the dramatics."  Snively looked around.  "Just tell me 
your answer.  Will you return to Robotropolis with me, or not?"

Some leaves rustled behind Snively, and a red-quilled figure appeared.
"I tol' you, mon, I canno' leave dis island.  I gotta guard my Ruby."

"Echidna," Snively falsely smiled, "there is no one left on Mobius with the
capability to find this island but myself.  How could someone steal your
precious `Ruby' if they don't even know this alcove exists?"

"But ev'ryone wants my Ruby, mon.  It's special."
 
Snively internally chuckled.  This foolish creature of the forest was so
paranoid about some idiotic reddish rock.  It probably was a piece of
glass, or maybe it *was* a tiny little ruby.  Either way, it was
unimportant to Snively what it was.  "I told you," he said, "you can take
it with you if you want."

"I can' take it.  I tol' you, it don' wanna be took."

Snively sighed.  "Look, I could station some robot-soldiers..."

Knuckles grimaced.  "No!  No robots!  Dis island shall NOT have robots
on it!"

Snively recoiled.  "Okay, I won't put any here.  I just thought you'd want
some protection for your stone."

Knuckles grew silent, obviously considering some things.  Snively talked as
he thought.  "Look, I promise you that nothing shall happen to your `Ruby'
until you return."  Snively put his hand on the echidna's shoulder in a
false gesture of empathy.  "You will return here.  I *promise*."

"You promise?" the echidna spouted.

"Yes, I do."

Knuckles hmmed.  "Okay, I go wit' you.  But I want one mo' day here on the
island before I go.  Dat okay?"

Snively smiled.  "Yes, that will be fine."  *JUST* fine, he thought, and
just in time...  "I'll be back here at sundown tomorrow to pick you up.  Go
to the north shore, and a ship will come for you."

As Snively got back up, Knuckles disappeared back into the underbrush.  
The short human smiled evilly, and walked back up the path to flag down 
his vehicle.  This was too easy, he thought, as the ship landed, allowed
him to board, and rocketed back toward Robotropolis.

Joseph sped over miles of water, going in no particular direction for very
long, nor really planning to go anywhere.  He thought he might eventually
circumnavigate the world if he kept at this long enough.  And, when he saw
the patch of land over on the eastern horizon, he thought he had.  He sped
curiously over to it, wondering which coast it was.

After a second or two, he was running along the coast of the land, and then
realized it was an island.  He hadn't quite circled the globe yet,
obviously, but this phenomenon still deserved investigation.  He went
ashore, and started to slow--

*BONK*

When he came to, it was nighttime, and he was staring up into a pair of
eyes.  "Uhh..." he groaned as a pair of hands grabbed him and pulled him to
his feet.

"How did you get 'ere!?  'Ave you come to steal my Ruby?!?"

"Huh?"

Something that felt like a brick nailed him across the face, causing blood
to drip from his mouth.  "I ASKED you a ques'ion, intruder!"

"Muggaahh..."

"Arrgh!  "What are you, stupid?!"

"I...don't understand...intruder?"

*POW*

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph woke up a few hours later in a bamboo cage, hanging over a large
pit.  A few rails had been redded with the liquid that had poured from his
oral cavity after the figure had decked him.  (With what, he wondered, a
brick?)  In addition to that painful injury, a few more additional cuts 
had been inflicted (but healed) on parts of his stomach and arms; 
obviously caused by being dragged through some sharper underbrush.  

Struggling to his feet, he tried to regain his bearings.  He was in a dense
part of the jungle.  The cage was hanging from a single treebranch, but it
looked stable...for now.  There was solid ground closeby the pit (which he
now saw having sharp spikes at the bottom) and a single path leading away
from it deeper into the forest.

He quickly came to the decision to try and swing the cage out from over the
pit, and onto solid ground, where it would probably break open.  As he
began to rock it back and forth, he heard (as expected) the branch
beginning to go.  He rocked a little harder, and he started to hear it
crack.  He finally gave the cage a teriffic shake, and the branch broke,
plummeting it to the earth below.  The cage began falling soon after that;
it tumbled toward the ground, shattered open, and spilled its 
contents onto the forest floor.    

What Joseph had forgotten to anticipate was the pain factor involved in
being inside of a cage when it crushed into the earth.  He agonizingly
climbed out of the wreckage, picking small pieces of bamboo out of his
quills.  He was beginning to hate this place.  A lot.

After he had gotten himself together, he wandered silently down the path.
Luckily, his martial arts training had not been effected by his
transformation, so he was able to stealthily traverse the path without
distrurbing a single item in the forest.  Hopefully, he could find the
shore, rev up, and get off this island before anything bad--

--happens.

He emitted a series of vile Ur'thaen curses, and snarled.  This irritated
Joseph to a great degree.  His internal power cells were supposed to last 
for about 1000 years before ever dipping below 50%, and here were his 
systems crying 5% 6 months after it had been activated.  Then, he 
realized exactly how much load he had put on his body in the last
6 months, and was able to calm his fears of his body having leaky fuel 
cells.  

But, it still left the problem of finding fuel.  He was going to have
difficulty finding something digestible without having to confront whatever
it was that struck at him.  It was about as strong as he was at this point,
and certainly didn't like him very much...he thought Joe wanted to steal
his `Ruby', whatever the hell that was.  

So, he did some quick internal calculations.  If he went at a normal speed,
didn't use his augmented strength much, and avoided further injury, he
could last about a year on the island.  After all, the food looked edible,
and the water was fairly clean...but he didn't want to be here a year.  He
didn't want to be there a day!  He wanted to go home.  

He pounded his fist against his hand.  No, there had to be crystals on this
island.  There were crystals everywhere on this planet!  All he had to do
was look.  He turned his optical scanners to detect energy signatures, and
went off to find some.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

At daybreak, Joseph reached the shore.  He had covered half the island, and
he was down to about 4% of his total energy.  So far, he hadn't detected
much of anything.  Some small pebbles were all that carried any sort of
juice in them, but they had not enough to even make a spark.

The sun beamed down upon Joseph, trying ineffectually to give him some
solar energy.  Alas, but he had no solar panels on him, and no means to
make any.  It did, however, warm him up enough so he physically felt
better, and made him think to sweep the horizon and admire the view.  
As he looked around, he noticed a small, craft-shape energy
imprint upon the ground.  He walked over to it to examine it further.
A ship had landed there earlier, no more than a day ago, and quickly had
taken off again.  (He could understand why someone would do that.)

However, it appeared that it was a Robotropolis-brand ship that had landed
there, by the blackish residue that was left on the ground.  Had someone
else decided to take a holiday here?  He hadn't seen anyone else but the
figure that attacked him...but Robotnik wasn't into bamboo, he thought.

This was becoming a really strange situation, Joseph pondered, as he
wandered toward the other side of the island.  Mysterious guardians of
unknown jewels, unknown landings of Robotnik-made crafts...it was all
connected somehow, but Joe couldn't see it.  He started walking down a path
that led through the other side of the island.  He began to mull over
exactly what could be so important that whoever was guarding it would
savagely beat whomever seemed to threaten it...

Then, a blip appeared in front of him.  A large crystal vein was on this
side of the island, toward the center.  He smiled.  His ticket home was
right on the beaten path.  Perhaps this is what the strange one was
guarding, Joe thought.  Well, he won't mind if I take a few off his hands
for lunch now, would he?

He wasn't going to take any chances either way.  He returned to his
stealthy mode of walking, and seemed to disappear into the underbrush.
Within a few hours, he was in the center of the island.

He was on the very edge of the clearing.  A cave was directly in front of
him, giving off an reddish glow deep inside of it.  This is what the person
who had attacked him was guarding.  "I wonder what's inside of it," Joseph
whispered aloud.

"My Ruby's inside o' dere."

He didn't turn around.  He *knew* what would happen if he turned around.
So, he just burst forward toward the cave.  "GET BACK 'ERE!!!" shouted the
figure as Joseph hit the sound barrier halfway through the cave.  

<< WARNING: POWER LEVELS AT: 2% AND DROPPING >>

He got to the back of the cave, no longer caring whether or not that person
liked him or not.  When he got to the inside of the cave, he pushed a large
boulder in front of the opening out, so that the individual trying to kill
him would at least be slowed down.  He heard thumping on the rock, and
muffled shouting, but he had not broken it down enough to get
through...yet.  Having that out of the way, he ran as fast as was 
prudent to the back of the cave.  

He was stuck dumb with awe when he entered the area where the light was
coming from.  The walls of the domed area were covered in glowing, sparking
energy crystal.  In the center of the room, there was an energy core that
was being powered by a reddish rock...his `Ruby', obviously.  But why did 
this undeveloped island need this much power?  What was this `Ruby' really?
He took a closer look at it, and accessed his records of Mobian geological
history.  No, he thought, it couldn't be.  But it *had* to be.  

This `Ruby' was actually a Chaos Emerald.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

This explained a lot, thought Joseph.  Chaos Emeralds were mythical, 
mystical power crystals that are capable of generating extreme amounts of
clean, emissionless energy.  They were also said to have special powers of
their own, depending on their color.  But this was unimportant to Joseph
right now.  All he knew was that the red rock in the center of the room was
best left where it was.  It was probably incompatible with his digestive 
system, anyway.  So, instead of attempting to acquire that particular
crystalline morsel, he started trying to break off bits of the more 
digestible power crystal on the walls.

Meanwhile, the boulder in the front of the cave suddenly formed a large 
crack in the center of it, and seconds later it crumbled to the ground.
A very pissed-off Knuckles then strode in, looking to beat the tar out of
the `thief' inside by his delicate `Ruby'.

Joseph was too busy trying to chip off a mouth-sized crystal off the wall
to notice the boulder crumbling to dust in back of him.  He hoped that if
he ate this one it would be enough to keep him going long enough to get
back home.  

Unfortunately, he never got a chance to find out.  Knuckles swiftly went
into a flying tackle onto the weakened and bleeding hedgehog, knocking 
the crystal out of his hand.  It flew across the room and shattered on 
the wall, directly next to Joseph's hope of leaving here peacefully.   
He was then slammed against the wall and kicked in the back.  He yelped as
he felt a quill snap off one of his lower rows and scatter onto the floor.

Being driven to even more savagery by Joseph's acknoledgement of his abuse,
he punched Joseph repeatedly in the face, yelling on each impact.  "STAY!" 
*POW*  "'WAY!"  *SOCK*  "FROM!"  *BAMF*  "MY!"  *WHACK*  "RUBY!!!"  *CRACK*
By the time "FROM!" had rang out, Joseph had begun to go somewhat blind,
and his eyes freely bled blackish fluid.  He coughed up a few mouthfuls of
bloods after the 5th or 6th sucessive hit, giving Knuckles a sense of great
personal pride.  But, he grew tired of this, and decided to switch from his
face to some other part.  Making a split-second decision, he threw him to 
the ground and started kicking Joe in the stomach.  Joseph was blinded 
completely, and was beginning to lose his sense of hearing.  All that was 
left to his sensors was the pain.  

After a few more kicks, Knuckles grabbed him by the throat, pushed his face
inside the engine core, burning a centimeter or two off of it.  Joseph
tried to scream; but the echidna closed his fist around his throat, choking
his howl to a squeak.  "You betta take a nice, GOOD look at my Ruby,
'cuz it's the LAST thing you're EVER gonna see!"  

<< WARNING!  WARNING!  CRITICAL DAMAGE LEVELS!  WARNING!  WARNING! >>

He weakly struggled to break the echidna's grip, but he barely had enough
power to writhe around in agony.  He got a few good kicks in around
Knuckles' midsection, but nothing that could make him let go of him long
enough to let him breathe...

<< WARNING!  WARNING!  ENERGY LEVELS CRITICAL!  WARNING!  WARNING! >>

He felt like he was gagging on his own pancreas.  He knew his eyeballs were
about to pop out from the pressure, and his mind was beginning to go...

<< TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE IN 10 SECONDS >>

He clawed at Knuckles' quills, but only managed to prick himself in the
fingers.  He kicked and swung his arms, but Knuckles knew he was almost
dead....  

<< TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE IN 5 SECONDS >>

No!  Not again!  Not before I--

<< SYSTEM SHUTDOWN >>

For Joseph, time stopped.  He lost all memory of his life, his world, his
entire existance.  The struggling ceased; the static died down to silence, 
his sensors stopped recieving information...the world grew cold, spun, 
and slowly faded to black...

But then, a miracle occured.

Actually, a biological miracle occured.  His body used the remaining volts
of his internal power to mutate his tongue into an energy reciever.  Then,
running on sheer exhaust fumes, it gave it just enough length to wrap
itself around the crystal, and shot it out to try to siphon off as much
energy as it could.

It got far, far more than it bargained for.  In fact, it got more than
enough.  Immediately, ruby-red energy carressed Joseph's limp form,
catapaulting Knuckles across the room and out of the cave.  Slowly,
Joseph's energy levels went up, slightly dimming the crystal's light.

However, as Joseph was recharging, the island was beginning to sink.  
The beaches slowly started to retreat under a blue wall of water.  Small 
animals desperately ascended trees, rocks, anything they could find in 
order to avoid being drowned.

<< ENERGY LEVELS RISING.  10%.  20%.  30%.  40%.  50%.  60%.... >>

After a few moments, Joseph's power levels were back to 100%.  As he
disengaged his tongue from the crystal, and returned it to a normal length,
his healing systems came back on-line, and started to repair the damage
that had been done.  He barely noticed the small earthquake that occured
after he fell from the crystal, nor did he care what it meant.  He just 
wanted to repair his screaming shell of a body.

He slowly rubbed against the energy crystal-covered wall.  He was too
exhausted to even move.  He doubted he was going to be able to go anywhere
for 15 minutes or so as he renewed hiself.  The creature had beat him up
pretty bad.  His vision was just coming back, and his hearing was still
fuzzy.  Not only that, it seemed like his entire body core hurt.  

He coughed up some blood and spat it onto a nearby rock.  It hissed,
bubbled, and ate right through it.  He was relieved.  He wasn't internally
bleeding anymore; or else the clotting agents would have neutralized the
blood's acidic effects.  

His sight clarified seconds later.  That was much better.  Checking his
power levels, he was somewhat discouraged...it was eating up most of his
power.  He'd be back to 50% after all the repairs were complete.  But
that'd be enough to finish his host off...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Knuckles was laying unconscious in a clearing about 1000 yards from the
cave.  The charge had knocked him clear through the forest, and he was cut
up pretty bad.  Of course, he didn't notice this, because he was in a
stupor, but it still appeared awfully painful.  His gloves were also
somewhat singed, but they were at least not on fire any longer.

He began to come out of it.  Shaking his head, he groaned at the amount of
damage the hedgehog had done to him.  Ruby had shocked both of them pretty
good.  Hopefully, the stupid orange hedgehog thief was dead, and nobody
would bother Ruby until he got back.  He hated trespassers.

He stood back up.  Ruby was still there, by the glowing that came from the
cave.  But he had to be sure the hedgehog was dead.  Had to.  Could be
alive, FAKING dead.  He wandered back into the cave, and slowly returned to
the crystal room.

Joseph was there, acting dead.  Since he didn't have any pupils to dilate,
he simply gave off a pheromone that denoted deadness.  Hopefully, the
echidna would smell it, and think him demised.

Knuckles entered.  He looked over at the puddles of blood laying around,
seeping into the ground.  The hedgehog bled a lot.  Dirty hedgehog.  Bad
hedgehog.  He looked at the dead hedgehog.  Good.  His instincts told him
he was dead, so he had to be.  He decided he didn't like the dead hedgehog
with Ruby, making the place smell bad.  So, he grabbed him by the
shoulders, and pulled him out of the cave.

The sun was beginning to set, so Knuckles hurried along, dragging the
hedgehog through the dirt.  He'd leave him outside the cave as a warning.
Nobody would go into a cave where a dead animal laid outside.  Just the way
it was.  He dropped him in front of the cave, right in the center of the 
enterance.  Thinking no more of it, he turned his back on the `dead'
hedgehog, and started to walk up the trail.

<< REPAIRS COMPLETE >>

Joseph stood up, and ran over to Knuckles as silently as the wind.  He
grabbed the naive echidna by the throat.  "Miss me?" he whispered into his
ear, and threw him into a tree.  A few teeth fell out of Knuckles' mouth,
accompanied by a few droplets of blood.  Smiling psychotically, Joseph 
peeled him off the tree and spiked him on the ground.  "So..."  He punched
him in the snout.  "You *actually* think--"  He fit his left ear, making it
squirt most reddish fluid.  "--you can go around beating--" He kicked him 
in the head.  "--people--" He stomped on his abdomen.  "--up?"  He threw 
him down the path.  "Huh?"  Knuckles stumbled toward the beach, trying to
escape the enraged hedgehog.  He pursued Knuckles, anxious to pummel 
him some more.

Knuckles ran toward the beach.  Bad hedgehog not dead!  Got strong from
Ruby!  Now was angry at Knuckles for stopping him from stealing Ruby.  
Help!  Help!  Snively would help.  Snively powerful.  Has powerful
machines.  Lazers that blow things up.

Joseph relentlessly chased his attacker.  He was going to be sure he was
throughly punished for beating him up when he was defenseless, and without
provocation.  He didn't want to kill him, mind you--he was not a
overzealous member of the warrior caste--just rough him up enough to teach
him to be more tolorant.  

Knuckles stood on the north shore nervously.  He looked back toward the
path, and saw the outline of the hedgehog coming close.  He looked to the
horizon, and just then saw the shadow of a single ship...Snively's ship!
He'd save him!  He'd blast the bad hedgehog into dust.  Teach him a lesson.

He saw Knuckles standing on the beach, and noticed the small craft fly
down, pick him up, and go back into the air.  "Oh, no you don't," Joseph
said, and projected some energy at the ship.  It locked onto him and shot
some beams back.  He ran along the shore, trying to trick the ship into
dropping down low enough so he could get a clear shot in.  Unfortunately,
it did not.  

Meanwhile, while the SWAT Bots were firing at Joseph, Knuckles was trying
to tell Snively what had happened.  He ignored most of the foolish babble
about `Ruby', of course, but realized he'd have to kill this fast,
nigh-invincible (hmm) hedgehog before Knuckles was going to leave.  
Knuckles, of course, had an idea...

Joseph had now almost ran a total circuit around the island.  He was
wondering how he was going to escape their fire, and not let them get the
Chaos Emerald at the same time.  But then, Knuckles jumped out of the
craft, and (instead of running at him) ran back toward the cave. 
Hopefully, he'd find some way of hiding it, or destroying it.  He thought
no more of the odd occurance, and continued dodging the fire of the SWAT
Bots.  

He ran beneath a series of cliffs, trying to dodge the continual bursts of
plasma.  However, he neglected to notice the large boulder directly above
him, and hid there from the ship.  It apparently didn't see him...but
Knuckles did.

He had ran around in front of the cave, taken a path to the other side of
the island, and climbed up the cliff where the boulder was.  Then, he had
gotten a piece of wood, lodged it under the rock, and was waiting for the
hedgehog to get in position....NOW!

The boulder, after being dislodged from its resting place, raced down to
the ground, making hardly a sound.  When Joseph finally noticed it, it was
too late.  It slammed into him, and shoved him deep within the moist 
earth.  

Knuckles, of course, *knew* this had to have killed him.  He cheered, did a
victory dance, and rapelled down the cliff.  He then stumbled out to the
ship, and hopped in.  Seconds later, they were both gone.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

An hour passed.  The rock didn't move.  A small puddle of blood was forming
next to it, and it was beginning to attract various insects.  The tide came
in, and started to wash softly against the rock, cleansing the earth of the
reddish pool.  The occasional bubble began to hiss up from the wet crater,
making it sound like a boiling mud pool, but instead of mud, there was
hemoglobin.  It looked like some sort of macabre metorite had crashed.

Then, as if a geyser was forcing it away, the rock split in half, and
Joseph crawled out of the hole, vomiting up sand and dirt.  He felt
absolutely miserable.  It had taken him what seemed like aeons to charge up
anouther energy in his index fingers (the only part that was touching the
rock after it pushed him 2 3/4 feet underground) to start cutting the rock,
and it had drained him down to 25% again.  

This *sucked*.

He had been beaten, electrocuted, buried, crushed, burned, nearly drowned,
and shot at.  His energy levels had gone from 100% to 1% to 50% to 25%.
It felt like a really nasty form of vixen PMS.  He just wanted to charge
up, teleport home, and not leave the dome for 2 weeks.  

As he continued to wash himself off, he began to realize how fortunate it
was to be able to teleport home.  Sure, he'd have to get fully charged,
have to pretty high up, and his broadcasting array on his body wasn't 
the best, but it'd be just enough to tell Bahb to teleport him home to 
his own power charger.  He made a mental note never, never, never EVER to
take another vacation the rest of his life.  At least not without a plasma 
shotgun.  Man, he could have used one of those.  

He wandered back up the path to the cave.  The interior of the forest
looked like it had seen a world war.  Trees were bent over, there was blood
everywhere, and nothing dared move.  He grumbled.  He had lost control, and
messed up this entire ecosystem for everyone.  Good one, moron.  Hopefully,
it'd heal itself in 5 years or so, with luck.  It would look a little
better, anyway.

Approaching the cave, it didn't look much better.  He'd really beaten the
tar out of that echidna here.  Little red quills were sticking out of the
dirt like a bad hair weave.  A few teeth were also intermixed with the
quills, giving the whole area the stink of death.  It made him sick.

He wandered into the cave, which didn't look as bad.  It was only *his*
blood in here, and the crystals on the walls were vaporizing it pretty
quickly.  He went over to the Chaos Emerald, placed his hands around it,
and boosted his power back to 100%.  A few repairs and a minor earthquake
later (possibly caused by the Emerald's draining) pursued later, he charged
himself again.  Now he was back to where he was supposed to be.  He hoped
he wouldn't have to do that again for a long time.

A few minutes later, he had left the cave and ascended the cliff where the
boulder was.  Looking down, he realized that it had to have nailed him
really freakin' hard.  The cracks in the mud looked like something you'd
see on one of the three moons of this planet.  A complete wreck.  Thank
goodness it had happened in an out-of-the-way place, or else the entire
island would look like a war zone.

He pointed his eyes to the rising moons.  He calculated his exact location
in relation to Knothole, triangulated the angle of the moonbounce, and
transmitted an encrypted transporter call, with full coordinates, to his
teleporter in his lab.

The transmission shot to the 1st moon, bounced off of it at a 34 degree
angle, and refracted to the secret reciever unit by the original crash
site.  It traveled from there by buried wire 1 mile down into the earth,
went back up the hyperfast eribrum-doped fiberobtic backbone Joseph had
strung down into the earth, and back into the dome.

Bahb intercepted the transmission, decrypted it, and sent it down to the
3rd level of the Dome, the laboratory.  The automatic servos began pumping,
and the teleporter powered up.

Joseph was then surrounded by an opaque bubble, which lifted into the air
momentarily and popped, leaving no trace of either bubble or passenger.  
With that, Joseph left the Floating Island...a wreck.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

A second or two later, he rematerialized, looking like a refugee, in the
3rd SubBasement of his home.  Ahh.  Home sweet home.  He'd never want to
leave it again.  

He didn't even acknoledge the computer.  He hopped on the minielevator pad
and went straight to the 1st level, his bedroom.  Then, he plowed right
into the bathroom, showered, dried off, walked back into the bedroom, laid
down on the bed, and passed out.  

He slept for 5 days.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

But what of Knuckles and Snively?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

"Here," Snively said, "put this on your face.  It'll heal it faster."

Knuckles could only moan quietly.  He hurt.  "Muhguh."

"Oh, stop complaining.  You'll be fully healed by the time we enter
Robotropolis.  By now, Robotnik should be throughly crushed by the
hedgehog."

Before Knuckles could groan something, Snively said, "No, it wasn't that
one.  The one I talk about is blue.  Don't worry, you'll get to 
meet him..." He smiled evilly.

"I promise."

			     Epilogue

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

About 5 days later, Joseph woke back up.  He mumbled as he stumbled out of
bed and gave himself yet another through scrubbing.  He still felt echidna
quills sticking out of his back.  Not only that, he'd slept for a really
long time, according to his internal chronometer.  He'd probably needed it.
Alas, he was going to have to mine some crystal pretty soon, because he
knew his energy levels weren't going to be constant for long...

He got himself back to a tolorable state and went back to the surface of
his home.  The Dome looked especially lovely today.  Bahb had made sure the
windows had stayed especially clean, and the light streamed in with
impunity.  The entire room was warm with the power of the sun.  It made him
feel much better about himself, and far more vibrant--

He got an idea.  Solar energy!  Of course!  The entire Dome was almost a
perfect focusing tool; it was a massive upside down lens.  All he had to do
was to install another lens in the reverse direction in front of his
skylight, and he could focus the rays of the sun into an extremely
high-frequency energy beam.  Then, he could create some sort of battery to
store it, and get recharged off of the light of the Mobian sun.  Just like
how he powered the rest of the house!  And he wouldn't have to take any
more of the house's energy to do it.

Quickly, he set to work on drawing up the plans for the new device,
wondering what else he could use the excess energy for....

Timeline: A month or two after Doomsday.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


It was nearing noon over the Great Forest.  The day's activities were in
full swing for most of the world, and save one--nay, make that two--places,
it was bathed in a glorious yellow tint from that world's local star.

However, the place we shall be focusing on would soon be bathed with light
as well.  When the sun reached its zeinth above it, focusing mirrors would
bounce an amplified beam of light off a series of mirrors and focusing
devices, until the light was a tight, hard beam of energy.  Then, it would
be shot down from the final mirror, and hit an energy port on a certain 
still figure laying on a slab in the center of the area.  For 3 minutes,
this beam would strike the port, raising the object's energy levels back to
its full capacity.  Then, the mirrors would fall out of alignment, and the
area would return to its normal, dim state.

Seconds later, the sun reached its full height above that area of Mobius'
horizon, and beams of the life-giving orb fell upon the Dome's clear
skylight.  The beams reflected off a series of mirrors, through a myraid of
lenses, and finally struck the lifeless figure's opened abdomen.  The ray
crashed into a ultraefficent, recently-installed solar panel, and created
gigawatts of energy within seconds.

It continued like this for several minutes, gradually raising the
temperature inside the glassy structure to an almost unbearable,
fog-inducing high.  Finally, the sun started to descend toward the other
parts of Mobius, causing the beam to weaken, dim, and finally die.

As the abdomen of the figure closed up, the ventilation system kicked in
and started pumping the hot air out of the structure.  It traveled through
a long pipe along the forest floor, and finally was permitted to escape
several yards away, into another glassy structure.  This one, however, was
rectangular, and was completely opaque.  It was the size of a small hut,
and appeared to have no door in or out of it.  The mysterious structure
released nor admitted a single particle.  Its purpose is only known to
Joseph, and he has yet to choose to explain its purpose to the common
populace...

Meanwhile, Joseph was beginning to regain his senses.  His power levels
were back where they should be, and the Dome had cooled off rapidly.
He felt pleased with himself over the device he had constructed, and the
deroboticizer was coming along nicely.  So, since he had worked so hard the
last few days, he decided to allow himself a day of leisure.  He took a
cleansing breath of the charged air, and set himself to the remainder of
the pressing work that he had to accomplish before going out to `play'.  
Thus, after he cleaned up the public area in which he now stood of the 
Dome, and doing some minor body maintanence, he emerged into the warm
sunlight of the forest floor.

It was a lovely afternoon around Knothole, he noted.  The wind was blowing
toward the wreckage of Robotropolis, so one couldn't smell it.  The sun
shone through the forest in places, illuminating parts of the well-trod
path to Knothole irratically.  A few non-evolved rabbits hopped by, 
looking for clover or grass to eat.  In the distance, he could see the 
secret entrance to the village, with a few Mobians lurking around it 
on guard duty.

Smiling slightly at the rustic scene, he blasted toward the secret entrance
at nearly full speed, and stopped just short of flying through it.  His
control over his new form was improving daily.  Who knows, he thought,
perhaps it was an even better form than his initial one?  

Meanwhile, the two guards were gradually getting used to Joseph's blazing 
entrances.  It was usually the way he entered the village, because it was
the way Sonic usually entered it.  The two were becoming more alike than
either of the hedgehogs would like to admit.  Yet, Joseph's behavior was
still more unpredictable than Sonic's...he was slightly more mature than
his blue twin, and far smarter.  But before either guard could muse on this
topic further, the orange hedgehog nodded at them and shot through the
stump with a flourish; to a lower clearing in the forest where 
Knothole was located.  

He popped out of the log, and rolled to a halt upon the pile of hay that
served as a cushion for incoming Mobians.  He slid off the pile and brushed
himself off.  Few were around the entrance today...security had become
slightly more lax since Robotropolis was mostly destroyed.  The mood of the
village had also become lighter, and a bit more hopeful.  More roboticized
citizens wandered into the Great Forest daily, and they almost all 
regained their free will within days...thanks to a quick hack called a
`Cerebral Re-Activator' Charles and himself had created.

However, the newly-reborn roboticized citizens' reaction to Joseph 
occasionally was not always positive, he ruefully mused.  After someone 
that had been in the village relayed the story of Charles and Joseph to 
one of them, the odd cold stare could be felt creeping up his neck by a 
few irate roboticized citizens.  They didn't dare say anything, of 
course--Sonic would zealously defend his new intergalactic `brother' 
as if he were Tails--but he could feel their hatred.  He honestly couldn't
blame them for it, either...his guilt was not to be purged until the
deroboticizer was running, and all damaged were healed.  And even then, he
thought, it'd still be there, albeit weaker than before.  Sighing at this, 
he walked toward the hub of Knothole, hoping to snag a chili dog or two 
off Sonic.

He walked (he preferred walking within the city limits) into the town
square, where Sonic was leaning against a tree, munching a chili dog.  When
Sonic saw Joseph wandering into the village, he waved him over to him, and
tossed over a chili dog.

"Yo, Joe!" he hollered, and continued to gnaw on his pork product.  

"Hello, Sonic," Joseph said, and started eating his.  "Anything new?"

"Nope, just havin' some of Unc' Chuck's chili dogs."  He looked at the one
which he had almost completed, and sighed.  "Mmm, I didn't know how
much I missed these--" He polished that one off in a single motion, 
and began eating the other, half-eaten, one.  "--chili dogs."

Joseph nodded.  He sometimes envied Sonic's simple approach to life;
running fast, thwarting `badniks', eating chili dogs, and pursuing the
mutual affection of the Princess.  No guilt, no internal demons gnawing 
on his soul about someone else's mistakes, no constant, nagging feeling
that he's going to fail miserably, or that one of his mistakes could
destroy the entire world.  No loneliness, no yearning for a home that was
annhilated centuries ago, or even one pang of misery from the cold looks of
a roboticized citizen that would make his eyes sting from woe.  Just speed,
heroism, and the fufillment of carnal desires.  Oh, how that life appealed
to him!  He wished he could just return to nature; go feral, live in the
woods, eat berries...but, alas, his new form demanded technology to
survive.  He was no longer a simple organic construct, he was the last
remaining creation of his father, his world, his entire culture...he might
as well wish for a purple sky instead of wishing to escape the
technological plague that his mind, body, and soul were infected with. 
Both were about as likely!  

It didn't stop him from wishing, tho.  That's all he had; hope, wishes, and
dim memories and the collected knowledge of a world that nobody could ever
see, ever again.  He actively despised the last part, especially.  If he
was just blind to what had happened, and was just a rogue being crusing the
galaxy for cheap beer and cheaper women, his soul would be far purer.
But the knowledge made his soul blacker than night.  The evils that his
world had perpetrated, the curses they had heaped upon themselves...they
laid only on his shoulders now.  It was his only inheritance.

At night, he looked for the star that Ur'thae used to orbit, and waited
patiently for the one moment when the light of the explosion would
finally reach Mobius.  Only then would he believe it was actually gone.
He didn't want to believe it was dust...he so wanted to blame the live body
of his father for this, just to get the hatred away from him.  But his
father was dead, as was his world.  He was the only target left for Mobius'
anger, so he would take it all upon himself.  He was glad his father
couldn't see this world now--

"Joe!  Snap out of it!"

Joseph returned to his normal mental state.  "Sorry," he embarrassedly
said, "I was thinking about something."

"You think too much." was Sonic's reply.

"Yes," Joseph said, "I do."

Sonic kept eating his chili dog.  "Anyway, nothin's up now."  He smirked.  
"It's just another boring day in Paradise."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, in the smouldering wreckage of Robotroplis:

Snively flew around the perimeter of Robotropolis in Robotnik's hovercraft
(which gave him a great deal of satisfaction) assessing the progress of the
reconstruction of Robotropolis.  For the most part, the progress was
positive; without bothering to rebuild all the useless, smoke-belching
factories, and only rebuilding the essential parts of Robotropolis, the
reconstruction would only take another 6 months or so.  SWATBot production
was up, so soon regular patrols could start again.

However, Snively was becoming progressively more irritated with the lack of
Worker-Bots remaining to do the menial work of Robotropolis.  Apparently,
most of them were simply wandering off into the Great Forest.  Also, a good
portion were being abducted by Freedom Fighters.  This was really beginning
to bother him, because he was forced to call in other platoons of
Worker-Bots from other installations all over the planet.  If this kept up,
soon Mobius would be liberated from sheer lack of an occupying force.

But Snively let not this bring him down.  After all, he was Snively the
Great, Ruler of Robotropolis, Conqueror of Mobius, Master of All He
Surveyed!  No problem could hold *him* back for long.  He'd just think of a
way around it!  He laughed fiendishly.  And soon, he'd destroy the Freedom 
Fighters once and for all!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Back in Knothole:

Sonic and Joseph were leaning against a tree, and they were up to about
their 4th chili dog each when Charles walked over to them and greeted them.

"Hello, boys," Charles' metallic voice spoke, as he took a seat on a nearby
stump.  "What are you up to today?"

Sonic shrugged.  "Not much, Unc.  I'm chillin' until Sal needs me for
somethin'.  Maybe I'll get to go to ex-'BUTT-nikland to kick some more
SWATBot tail!"

Charles smiled.  "Son, at the rate you kick 'Bot butt, we're not going to
have a single one left standing for target practice."

"I know!  Isn't that Way Past Cool?!"

Charles laughed.  "Yes, Sonic, it is."  He turned toward Joseph as Sonic
started into another chili dog.  "How about you, lad?  Are you just going 
to take a break today...you should, considering you haven't left that dome 
in 2 weeks."  The metallic hedgehog smirked.  "I'm surprised you haven't 
discovered the secrets of the universe yet; you've not stopped work in 
all this time to go out and relax."

"I'm not quite the vacationing type," smirked Joseph, "and besides," He
regained a more serious expression.  "it's important to all of Mobius 
that I perfect this device.  Then, Robotnik will truely be dead."

"Well," said Charles, "give yourself SOME time to relax.  We don't want you
to have a nervous breakdown or anything like that.  We do have a good chunk
of time left for you and I to work in."

Joseph nodded somberly.  "It's as much for your benefit as it is mine."

Charles understood this silently.  "Look, just don't work yourself to
death."  He smirked.  "You're the other resident expert on the roboticizing
process, so stay alive long enough to finish the deroboticizer, okay?"

Joseph chuckled.  "Okay, okay, I get the idea."

Sonic chose then to complete his dog.  After gulping it down, he said,
"Anyway, how're you doing, Unc?"

"Me?  Oh, I'm fine.  I just completed work on the Cerebral Re-Activator
Ray--something I had in the works after Joseph and I completed the
nonmobile chamber--and it should greatly raise the number of roboticized
citizens we're able to return here.  All you have to do is make sure the
beam hits the head of the target, and their mind will override the
programming Robotnik put in them."  He smirked.  "And I'll have it in the
stores by Christmas."

Sonic smiled.  "Way Past Cool, Unc!  That'll make Sal happy."

Joseph nodded.  "Affirmative.  That will really be a big help."

Charles bowed.  "I try."

Then, Bunnie wandered over from a nearby hut.  "Hi, sugahhogs!" she shouted,
and hopped over to the tree.  "Anythin' new?"

Whenever Joseph looked at Bunnie--ever since he learned of the true nature
of the roboticizer, that is--he always felt a pang of sorrow for the
damaged rabbit.  Her body had been cursed with those ugly steel limbs, yet
she continued to be as she always had been.  His awe of her sheer will to
be happy was only exceeded by his shock of her lack of external bitterness
toward her life.  She was a survivor, and she still considered herself
(publicily, anyway) beautiful...yet, Joseph could not help but feel a
dagger plunged into his psyche from the sight of her.  He knew it wasn't
his fault for any of this, but he still felt responsible...she was one of
the main reasons he worked so hard on the deroboticizer.  It was one thing
to see someone who was totally roboticized: at least that person had lost
all of their external links to nature.  But Bunnie still was warm to the
touch, still had sparkling blue eyes to admire the world with...and a steel
arm to touch things with, and metal legs to walk across it.  He felt 
that she was a metaphor for Mobius; damaged, sick from the contaminants 
that seeped into her; yet still strong and determined to be well again.  

Sonic shook his head.  "Nope."  He smirked.  "The metalheads are just 
talkin' shop."

Charles and Joseph laughed.  "That we are," said Joseph, suddenly breaking 
from his internal anguish.

Bunnie smiled.  "Well, god forbid Ah keep y'all from yaur work."

Joseph shrugged.  "Well, we're not accomplishing a whole lot now."  He 
smiled at her.  "How are you doing?  Are you doing anything interesting?"

"Nah," she said, "Ah'm jus' killing tahm until Sal needs muh."  She looked
around a bit.  "It's a slow day in Knothole today, sugah.  Nuthin's gonna
happen 'til tonight, when we'll get s'more people outa Robo-tropolis." 

Joseph raised an eyebrow.  "There's gonna be a mission tonight?"

Bunnie bemusedly looked at him.  "Yah, sugah, there's been a mission ev'ry
night.  Didn'--"  Then, she realized something.  "Oh yah, you've been
inside the whole time.  You wouldn' know."

While Joseph mulled this over, Charles broke into the conversation.  He 
smiled, and said, "Excellent.  Now my new device can be tested!"  Before
Bunnie could ask, Charles explained what he had made.

"Y'all better tell Sal about that, sugah."  She waved to Sonic and Joseph,
and took Charles by the hand.  "She's planning the mission now," she said,
"So c'mon, let's go."  She dragged the disoriented Charles off to see the 
Princess, while Sonic and Joe looked on.

"Well," Sonic said, "if that thing works, it'll be Way Past Cool!  No more
dragging spastic 'bots back to Knothole!"

Joseph nodded, and smiled.  "It'll certainly save you a lot of time."

"I hope so," he said, "Joe, how I hope so."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Snively sat down in the large green chair that was the main piece of
furniture in the control center.  He observed the various screens that
displayed live video of areas all over Robotropolis, not to mention Mobius
itself.  It looked quiet today; the Freedom Fighters still only became
overtly active at night.  

He pushed some buttons, and reveled in the fact he was sitting in
Robotnik's chair.  He spun it around a few times to gloat.  After growing
tired of that, he talked into the intercom.

"Attention all SWATBots!" he piped, "roboticize all remaining prisoners,
and send them to work in Sectors 5A, 6G, and 436A-5."

A metallic voice on the other side acknoledged his transmission.

He smirked evilly.  "And do it slowly."

A quiet beep was heard from the speaker, and it fell silent.

Satisfied with that, he thought of other things he needed to do that day.
He had covered Robotnik's usual itinerary; He'd surveyed the landsdscape, 
ordered the daily robotization, had lunch, sneered at the Great Forest, 
brooded about the domination of Mobius, and abused a SWATBot.  The 
Worker-Bots and SWATBots were able to handle the actual repairs by 
themselves, and the refinaries would do just fine without any 
Sniv-intervention for a year.  He sighed, as bored badniks are wont to on
occasions such as these.  What to do, what to do...

Then, his eyes brightened as he realized what he could do to pass the time.

He walked over to a R&D laboratory close by to the Control Center.  He
entered it, and gazed upon an object he was keeping in here for its own
good.  

A Worker-Bot on the far side of Mobius, while in a crystal mine, hit the
large stone while trying to dig out a particularly tenacious formation.
It broke the pickaxe on contact.  So, following its programming, it called 
over a SWATBot for assistance.  It blasted the stone out, and when it could
not determine its nature, sent it to Robotropolis a few days after
Doomsday had miserably failed (...as expected).  

Since then, Snively was trying to figure out exactly how this stone, 
the Amber Chaos Emerald, worked.  

He decided against trying to make it power Robotropolis...Robotnik had
tried something similar once, and Snively thus reasoned that that course of
action would be suicide until the Freedom Fighters could be eliminated;
they would notice the sudden lack of smoke being belched out of the city,
and go to in to investigate, and then they'd find some way of stealing the
emerald from him.

So, he decided to pick a less obvious use for the emerald, yet one totally
predicitable to any individual familiar with Snively's mind: convert it
into a weapon that could destroy the Great Forest, and reveal Knothole.
However, this course of action was mysteriously difficult to accomplish.
The Emerald Ray would destroy non-natural things completely; SWATBots,
Worker-Bots, garbage, anything that was manufactured.  But if it was fired
at a tree, or a small animal, it'd heal it and make it stronger.
That annoyed him to no end.  But, he was determined to bend the emerald to
his will, no matter how difficult it would be to do so.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The sun was beginning to set, which signaled Knothole to begin to prepare 
for the night's activities.  The Mobian village put away its things from
the day's work, ate its dinner, and cleaned up everything else before 
preparing for a restful sleep.  Everyone, that is, but the Freedom Fighters
who were about to go out for a night's mission.

Sonic, Sally, Antoine, Charles, Dulcy and Bunnie were standing 
around the updated holographic depiction of Robotropolis, planning their 
route in and out in order to get as many people out as they could in a 
night.  The Cerebral Re-Activator Ray dramatically increased this number, 
so they figured on getting (at the least) about 20-25 people out that 
night.  

While they were discussing their plans, Joseph sat outside the hut,
silently listening to their plans.  He'd never been on a mission, and he
always had wondered how one had been organized.  Quite well, by his
observations.  Maybe they'd ask him to tag along one day...

He heard movement in the hut, and disappeared up a tree.  Using his martial
arts training, he slipped into the shadows without a sound.  Sonic was the
first to emerge.  "I'm gonna bag a ring, Sal," he said into the hut, and
ran off to the Power Ring Pool.  A few seconds after he left, the rest of
the Knothole crew went outside the hut.  They divided into teams, and
the leader of each team recieved a pistol to zap roboticized citizens with.
A second later, Sonic arrived with his ring.

"Charles, you're with Antoine," Sally said, "and Bunnie, you're with me.  
Sonic will provide the diversion, and we'll ship the roboticized citizens
out on you, Dulcy."  She looked at the dragon.  "Do you remember the 
rendezvous point, Dulcy?"  The dragon nodded.  "Good."  She took another
deep breath.  "The last ride out is at 00:00, at the predetermined
rendevous point."  She looked at her watch.  "Okay, sync your watches 
at 21:00.....now!"  A round of beeping later, everyone had the same time.

"Everyone ready?"  A round of nodding.  "Okay, everyone on Dulcy but
Sonic."  They boarded the dragon.  "Sonic, you rem--"

"Like the recipe for Unc Chuck's chili dogs, Sal."

Sally smirked.  "Then go!"

Sonic, with a wink and a flourish, took off toward Robotropolis.  After
waiting a minute or two, Dulcy got a running start, and also took off
toward Robotropolis.  

After they had left, Joseph lept out of the tree, and landed quietly on the
ground.  He vaguely considered going home, and waiting for them to return,
which would be what a logical, rational person would do.  But, for some 
reason, he had a yearning to pursue them.  He wanted to kick 'bot butt as
well.  (Such feelings were becoming more common as the hedgehog DNA began
to sink deeper in to his genetic makeup.)  He pondered for about 5 minutes,
but finally snapped.  He was going to follow them.  But he wouldn't
interfere; he'd watch from a distance cloaked.  To study Mobian guerilla
warfare.  That's it.  He would *study* them.  It wasn't tagging along when
he was forbidden to, it was science!  He checked Bahb's energy levels. 
Once he was sure they were up to 100%, he took off toward Robotropolis as
well.    

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
Snivley stared into the control center's screens.  So far, the Freedom
Fighters hadn't shown up for the night's attempt at freeing Worker-Bots.
He had, like he had done for the last several nights, dedicated himself to
killing them all tonight.  He put Robotropolis on full alert, and had
his aerial forces circling the perimeter, as usual.  There would be no
mistakes tonight.  

I(vos)H(yper)A(c)T(iv)ET(rackerof)H(e)AT(fromthe)HEDGEHOG (Robotnik's 
last joke.  The acronym is I.HATE.THAT.HEDGEHOG.  He always did make 
really, REALLY stupid jokes, Sniv thought.) radar beeped, detecting 
Sonic roaring in to start the eternal diversion.  Sniv wondered what he'd 
hit tonight.  He was running out of things to destroy...Robotropolis 
wasn't much now to begin with.  The lazer fire he heard, and the 
SWATBot calls for backup seemed to denote that Sonic was assulting one of
their primary refineries again.  Snively growled.  He either let the
hedgehog weaken Robotropolis further by destroying the refinary, or let the
hedgehog weaken Robotropolis further by his abduction of Worker-Bots.
Snively was beginning to DESPISE these Catch-22s.  Resources for SWATBot 
production was going from 300% to 500% tomorrow, he vowed annoyedly.  
Then, Snively angrily activated the intercom.  

"Attention all SWATBots!  Hedgehog alert!  Report to Refinery 24-A!" he
bellowed, "AND SHOOT TO KILL!"  

Snively realized that this was going to leave the Worker-Bots in Sectors G,
H, and I unguarded and ripe for FF attack.  But the refinery was more
important to Sniv, so he forced himself to tolorate the FF damage of his
labor force.  (Needlenose isn't the brightest bulb in the box, y'know.)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sonic raced through the refinary, smashing the hell out of anything that
looked fragile or important.  Dodging SWATBot fire, he swerved to and fro
inside the building, spin-dashing through the metallic menaces.  It would
normally take him maybe 5 minutes to totally disable one of these
establishments, but he needed to buy lots of time for the rest of the FFs
who were rescuing citizens.  So, he simply continued to race back and forth
irratically, damaging and destroying as much stuff as he could.  

Meanwhile, the first 5 people they were able to grab and zap were loaded 
onto Dulcy, and were flown back to the Great Forest as fast as Dulcy 
could manage.  They were disoriented, but they got themselves together
enough to hang on to the dragon for dear life.  

Joseph was watching the whole scene from a safe distance on the eastern
limits of Robotropolis.  He'd tapped into the security system, and was
getting a Sniv's-eye view of what was happening.  (He was also blanking
certain screens at random times, so to make it appear like simple technical
problems as a result of Doomsday, to keep Sniv from knowing where the FFs
were...but it wasn't directly hurting anything, so it was okay!)  It
appeared to Joseph that what Sonic had told him about Snively was correct.
He was a freakin' moron.  He was concentrating a majority of his forces in
one localized area to fight one Freedom Fighter from destroying something
that would be vital in the short-term; while the majority of the 
Freedom Fighters were all over Robotropolis, taking a resource away that
would be vital for the long-term survival of Robotropolis.

His brother would have a cerebral hemorrhage from watching this.

Joseph smiled when he thought of his brother.  Jhack was a big, tough
high-ranking member of the warrior caste, a master of all things tactical. 
He always kicked Joseph's butt in jed'ar (a game similiar to chess).  He
would have loved to watch this conflict unfold; it was a classic example of
unconventional warfare toppling a conventional regime.  He missed him
sometimes.  Sighing, he went back to watching the chaos unfold...

Then, he noticed something.  There were no SWATBots around the Command
Center.  Nary a one.  They were all either at the Refinary, or guarding the
prison blocks.  Sniv left his front door wide open, but locked the back!
Quickly, Joseph debated how to utilize this information.  Should he sneak
into it and directly sabotage the command center, and risk capture, or
should he try and tell someone else?  He shook his head.  No, telling
someone else would endanger the mission.  If anything was to be done, he'd
have to do it himself.  What to do...

He took a 25 Mobium coin from the side of his boot.  He examined it.  The
side he was looking at had a grim-faced King Acorn on it, with some writing
along the side.  "Heads, I go, tails, I don't."  He flipped the coin, and 
caught it in midair.  He opened his hand; heads.  He smiled.  "Very well, 
I go."  He quickly removed all evidence he had ever been there, threw the 
coin over his shoulder, and stealthily stalked toward the egg-shaped 
Command Center.  The coin flipped over again when it hit the ground; on
that side, Acorn was smiling.

Sonic was beginning to tire of bouncing off the refinary walls.  He was not
only running out of things to smash, but the whole thing was getting old.
He just wanted to trash the damn thing, and move on to something more
interesting.  But what?  This was the only distraction Sally had given him.
He didn't know what other targets to hit.  There wasn't much left!

Then, it occurred to him that he could drag all the SWATBots into the
center of 'BUTT-nikville by attacking the control center.  Then, the rest
of the place would be nearly empty, and Sal could grab LOTS of guys and
gals.  He was rather pleased with himself for thinking at such a supersonic
pace.  

So, the next pass by the control room, instead of blasting past it, he
blasted into it.  This bought him a few precious seconds while he pressed
every button in the room, pulled every switch, and generally started
trashing the place.  Alarms upon alarms went off as the entire plant went
critical.  "WARNING!  AUTODESTRUCT MODE ENGAGED!  30 SECONDS UNTIL
AUTODESTRUCT.  29.  28.  27.  26.  25...."  Sonic took that cue to juice 
on outa there.  He engaged a little bit of power ring, and left a 
deafening sonic boom to be the harbringer of the larger orange-yellow 
explosion seconds later.

Snively went spastic.  Now not only had the Freedom Fighters gotten several
more Worker-Bots than usual out of Robotropolis, his favorite refinary was
totally destroyed.  He screamed and pounded his fists against the chair, a
la Robotnik.  "I HATE THAT HEDGEHOG!!" he hollered as he ordered every
resource he had available to stop the hedgehog from escaping.

But meanwhile...

Joseph approached the central entrance point for the egg-shaped
control center.  As more SWATBots streamed out of it, he quickly snuck in
against the flow of traffic and got past the 'bot dispatch point without a
hitch.  Sniv was too irate at the recent destruction of some installation
he liked to put up floating spybots inside his own inner sanctum.  Joseph
took this as a good omen, and traversed his way up the access stairs.

After walking for a few minutes (and hiding from a few SWATBots that were
rapidly streaming down the stairs as well) up the stairs, he finally came
to the outer fringes of Sniv' innermost sancti sanctum.  This was obviously
where all the really important stuff was.  Various sensitive and fragile
computers were hidden all the way up here, not to mention Sniv's R&D labs.
He was really losing a lot of respect for Needlenose.  And since he didn't
have a lot to begin with, that's saying something.

He walked into the center of the room, and observed some monitors.  Ooohing
at the stuff he saw, he extended his dataspike from his right arm and
started downloading all of it.  After an incredibly short period of time,
he got it all.  200 virus checks later (2 seconds), he compiled it and
mulled over the information.  The latest version of the roboticizer
software, plans for everything Robotropolis had, locations of bases, codes,
everything Sniv didn't want anyone to know about he had.  Joseph cackled
quietly.  This would certainly be useful--he heard a noise.  Quickly, he
hid behind a pile of old boxes, and waited to see who drew near... 

Snively stomped down the stairs, and rushed into his R&D room.  He
*thought* he heard the sound of rapid downloading, but there was obviously
nobody there.  Quickly, he ran to the back of the room to fetch his Emerald
Ray.  He kicked some boxes out of the way as he reached the zero-energy
field in which he kept it--a shadow--he turned to look behind the pile...

^L

Nothing.  Sniv shuddered.  He must be so angry, he thought, his mind was 
starting to play tricks on him.  He took a breath, and took the gun from
the field.  He wanted to be sure that he had it with him if the hedgehog 
tried to attack him tonight, and he believed he'd figured out how to make 
it kill.  He didn't know, tho, but he didn't want to have it laying out, 
anyway.  He rushed out of the room and shot back upstairs to the central 
control center, beginning to snarl somethin' fierce.

After he had left, Joseph cautiously poked his head out.  Sniv had taken
some sort of weapon from the far side of the room, and rushed back
upstairs.  Obviously, it was meant to attack Sonic with.  He hoped he'd be
able to evade it once Sniv started pursuing Sonic actively.  

Either way, he had what he basically needed.  Now, he'd just set up a nice
cat's-cradle program within the Robotropolis computer system OS, and...

"RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  HEDGEHOG PRIORITY ONE!"

Alarms!  Had he been discovered?  Arrgh!  He had no time left now.  Quickly,
he looked around for an exit.  He couldn't take the door--footsteps!  Shit!
He spotted a vent and jumped up and through it, closing it behind him.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

But it was not Joseph that set off the alarms.  It was the first
Mobius-biased Freedom Fighter hedgehog, Sonic, who set off the alarms.
He managed to set off every alarm system that Sniv had downstairs, calling
every SWATBot in Robotropolis back home to defend it from the blue blaze of
vengence that was Sonic.  He started his usual smash-and-run technique
there, attempting to take down the central Robotropolis SWATBot dispatch
grid, the food machines, and anything else that looked somewhat valuable. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

But Snivley knew the alarms to be the work of the hedgehog.  Immediately,
he rushed down the stairs, through his lab, and to a secret minihangar. 
There, Snivley kept *his* new pride-and-joy, Robotnik's old hovercraft.
He'd dug it out of the wreckage, and refurnished it himself.  It looked as
good as new, and now he'd add one more accessory to it; his (hopefully)
new Emerald Death Ray.  

He slapped the turret into place in front of the hovercraft, and jumped
inside of it.  Wasting no time, he started the formitable craft and blasted
out through a nearby wall.

The unexpected explosion was felt all over the remains of Robotropolis. 
When the Freedom Fighters spotted the hovercraft, several of the
weaker-hearted (namely, Antoine) quickly panicked.

"Aaaa!!  It is zee Robotnik!  Ze has come back from ze dead to make us
dead like heem!  Aaaaa!"

Charles didn't even try to calm him down.  "Run!" shouted Sir Charles, and
took the petrified Antoine by the paw as the remainder of the rescued 
roboticized bretheren followed suit.

Meanwhile, Sonic rushed out of the building, dodging some irksome SWATBot
fire, and was observing the hovership's flight path.  He was apparently
circling the center of Robotropolis, looking for where the hedgehog might
have hidden.  He quickly came to the conclusion that he'd give the ship
something to look for.

He rushed over to the center of the street, and started yelling.  
"HEY, NEEDLENOSE!" he yowled from the streets below, "YEAH, YOU IN
RO-CLUCKNIK'S RIDE!"  This sucessfully got Snively's attention.  
"PREPARE TO DIE, HEDGEHOG!" he bellowed, and started firing amber beams 
down upon him.

"Uh-oh." Sonic thought, and swiftly began swerving through the center of
Robotropolis to avoid the beams.  "Stand still!" Snively muttered as he
continued aiming, firing, and missing the hedgehog.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph was watching the battle unfold from inside the intake vent for the
Control Center, high up on the remains of the `roof' (if an egg-shaped 
structure can have a `roof').  He had noted that even though Snively
believed he was weaving around as irratically as the hedgehog, he passed
through a certain area of space every few seconds or so.  Joseph was
working on refining the exact target area, and was beginning to time his
envelope so he'd know when to....now!  Snively had passed through a section
of space every 2.3 minutes.  In another 2.3 minutes, he'd be there again,
and then would be the time Joseph would enact his plan.

He watched silently from his perch, continuing to watch the battle
unnoticed.  Sonic was irritating Snively rather efficiently.  Apparently,
whatever sort of `ray' he was using was constantly missing the hedgehog,
and he was making sure Snively knew it.  "HEY SNOTLEY!  NICE AIM!"  "YOU 
WILL EAT THOSE WORDS, HEDGEHOG!"  And then another barrage of firing from 
the hovercraft, even more badly aimed than the first.

He prepared himself to enact his plan.  30 seconds.  20.  10...9.....

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

At the exact moment Snively first entered an area directly below Joseph's
vent, he jumped into the hovercraft, taking the repugnant imp by surprise!
With a smooth movement, Joseph grabbed Snively by the neck, and started
throttling him.  "Die, you hideous excuse for a semi-evolved simian!" he
shouted into Snively's ears, and attempted to take control of the craft.

But Snively didn't fight fair.  (Or well.)  He kicked at the hedgehog's
stomach, only to fracture a few toes on the android's chestplate.  Yelling
in agony, he pulled a small dirk from his belt, and tried to shove it
through the hedgehog's armpit.  It penetrated it, but didn't even seem to
slow the creature down...then he got a good look at him, and then that's
when he really became frightened.

He looked like Sonic's body double, aside from the bright silver eyes.
Also, the hedgehog didn't look like he took prisoners.  After a quick
assessment of the mood of his attacker, he came to the conclusion that he
was about to--

Joseph knocked the little rodent out with a single punch.  He tore the
knife from his armpit, and threw it out the window.  Now, while trying 
to regain control of the odd craft, he was also attempting to disarm the
strange weapon, which seemed to be approaching overload levels. 
Apparently, whatever this thing was powered by, it was too much to be
withheld by the weapon for very long, once it was fired up.  He feared it
was going to explode, and he was still far too high up to jump--he quickly
pulled hard to the right, barely missing a tall buidling.  He was still too
high to jump, and he didn't know how powerful the power source was.  As he
fumbled around with the access port for the fuel cell, he mused what Sniv
could have found that was so powerful?  Some sort of radioactive isotope?
Alien technology?  Perhaps a Keld'yrian had lost something again...

All this time, Sonic had been hanging out, watching the aerial battle.
He was surprised to see his `brother' here, but he was glad he'd shown up.
Joe'd given Snotley the pounding of his life.  And soon, he'd just bring
the ship down to Mobius, and then they'd REALLY have him...

He finally fumbled with a octogon-shaped thing, and quickly removed it from
the gun.  He threw the powerless weapon off the ship, and tossed the stone 
casually into the back seat, not bothering to examine it (steering a 
unfamiliar ship tends to discourage scientific discovery), and continued to
attempt to regain control of Robotnik's round hovership.  He tried to make 
it go lower by cutting the power, but all that suceeded in doing was make 
the ship slow down.  That wasn't the effect he'd desired, but at least he 
could concentrate on the altitude control.  As he fiddled with the lever, 
he realized he was now drifing around on the eastern outskirts of 
Robotropolis.  He was rather surprised.  This vehicle travelled rather
quickly.  It must be the lack of its usual load.  He snickered at his joke.
Robotnik must have needed a whole lotta thrust to move this thing, he
pondered, and took the lever in his hand.  Then, taking a breath, he began
to slowly pull the lever down...

While Joseph had been trying to regain control, Snively had slowly regained
consciousness, and gradually came to the conclusion that this passenger was
not wanted in his hovership.  Reaching silently under the seat as the craft
started to come to a halt, he pulled out a short pipe Robotnik had kept
under the seat to club things with if they came too close to him in flight.
With a slow, purposeful movement, he raised the club above his head, and
swung just as Joseph was starting to lower the ship slowly to the ground.

The impact from the club didn't hurt Joseph as much as it surprised him. 
The metallic `thud' from the club attempting to damage his right lobe did,
however, make his teeth rattle unpleasantly.  He fell forward from the
blow, suddenly sending the small ship on a course straight up into the sky.
As it rocketed upwards, it began exerting strong g-forces against the
contents of the craft.  Snively, being a runty little weakling, was
immediately forced to the floor of the craft after the second g, while
Joseph (being an android and having more resistance to such things) 
merely readjusted his stance a bit, and desperately tried to regain 
control of the reddish blur before it entered a low Mobius orbit.  

Sonic watched the ship bob downwards, stop, and then scream up into the
upper stratasphere.  Needless to say, this surprised him.  Obviously, Joe
wasn't the world's greatest pilot.  Or maybe he was going to fly all the
way up there to drop Snively, or--lazer fire from behind him.  Uh-oh.
The SWATBots had wised up, and now had figured out where he was.  He
quickly poured on some speed, and raced away from the area, hoping to buy
Joe some time...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

With a small degree of difficulty, he stuck out his hand and took hold of
the lever.  Not wanting to be thrown out of the craft, he slowly started to
pull it back down; and slowly, the ship began to stop.  It came to a halt
again near the center of the lever's pull-area, to just about the limit of
the Mobian atmosphere.  Taking the opportunity to relax, seeing that
Snively was too weak at this height above Mobius to put up any sort of a
fight, Joseph looked up to note this unique perspective.  He could see the
darker areas with almost no ozone above it from the lighter, bluish areas
that had a higher level.  It was odd to observe such a thing; one comes to 
believe after long examinations of the sky on a clear day that the sky
seems to be an impervious bubble from which the rest of the universe is
seperated.  But, he thought, as one gets closer to the fringe of the 
atmosphere, one can see the small gaps that are formed as air currents 
cause the air to flow around in erratic patterns, leaving for minutes at a 
time small holes in the atmosphere; yet, from the ground, the sky always 
appears to be a solid blue bubble.  It brought to mind a proverb his 
grandfather had taught him... "Even the strongest wall has a hole."  He
waved his hand around in the small, black gap.  "A hole." he logically 
said, and exhaled a breath into the hole, filling it.  "Filled."

After looking into the sky some more, he decided to return to a more
Snively-compatible altitude, before the now quite-cold and weak human went
and died.  He was sure that Sonic could figure out what to do with him.
Probably put him on trial and lynch him, or maybe throw him in Ironlock.
Either way, it was an affair of state, so he'd try to stay out of it.
He was probably in enough trouble as it was going off to Robotropolis
without telling anyone.  Ruing Sally's potential wrath, Joseph pulled 
the lever slowly back, and gradually brought the hovership back closer 
to Mobius.

As he got nearer to the blackish cloud above Robotropolis, Snively began
coughing himself back to consciousness.  As he entered the murky depths of
the pollution cloud, all vision became temporarily obscured.  After
penetrating the center of the cloud, Snively gasped out a few words. 

"Where... *cough* are you tak-- *cough* ing me?"

"You're going back to Robotropolis, Snively."

"*cough* Huh? *cough*"

"Yeah, you're going back to Robotropolis, and Sonic is going to decide what
to do to you next."

The ship broke through the cloud, and the air slowly began to clear up. 
They were still high above the tops of the buildings, tho, but they could
now both see each other clearly.

"The hedgehog won't have the chance to.  My SWATBots will finish him before
we even hit the ground!"

"Oh, really?" Joseph snarled, and grabbed Sniv's green collar.  "I don't
think so, Snotley."  He lifted the protesting Snively outside the
hovercraft.  "You're going to call off your marauding SWATBot armies right
now."  He grabbed the microphone for the com-unit with his other free hand,
and shoved it into Snively's face.  "Aren't you?"

Searching for any sort of retort, Snively could only gasp.  After a second
of hanging precariously over the ground, tho, he finally stuttered,
"Att-t-tention all SWATBots!!  Cease Priority One pursuit and await 
further orders!"  

Joseph clicked the microphone off.  "Good work, monkey.  Perhaps we'll keep
you around to read commercials."  Snively could only stare blackly at his
obnoxious orange opponent of his overtaking of Mobius.  "Now, stop
squirming around, or I'll save Sonic the trouble and snap your neck right
here."  The human stopped wiggling.  "Good."

The ship finally came to a slow halt 3 inches above a stretch of road
somewhere within the center of Robotropolis.  Joseph dragged the whining
Snively back into the ship, and took him with him as he dehovercrafted out
the other side.  Looking around, he realized that it was almost time for
the Freedom Fighters present to go to the rendezvous point on the outskirts
of town, and then return to Knothole for the night.  Quickly, he realized
he'd have to get their attention in order to bring them back here.  So, he
shook Snively again.  "Flares!  I need a flare gun!  Now!"  

Snively quickly gesticulated to the glove compartment, where there was a
loaded, largish flare gun.  Joseph quickly grabbed it, and fired the device
into the air.  It shot into the sky, and into a bank of explosive gas that
one of the factories had recently set off.  The ignited phosphorous in the
flare reacted with the various methanes in the cloud, and created a large
explosion that quickly became a massive one.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, Sonic and the rest of the Freedom Fighters had assembled with a
large group of recently renewed roboticized Mobian citizens.  Sonic was
attempting to explain what had happened to him as quickly as possible.

"...and then, Joe comes flyin' off the roof of Sniv's command center, right?!
He must've said something cool like me, and done some of that wicked 
kung-fu stuff he does, 'cuz Sniv went down for the count in a Sonic Second!
Then, he starts joyriding in 'BUTT-nik's hovercraft, and was tryin' to land
but Snotley musta done somethin' 'cuz Joe fell forward and hit some lever 
and then the ship went screamin' up, up, Way Past Up into the sky, 
right about--" and just as he pointed to where it went up, a small flare
went up into a small cloud.  Within seconds, the whole sky seemed to be
on fire.  "--there."

"He must be in trouble!" Sally said, "Sonic, go--"

When Sonic heard the word `go', he figured out the rest for himself. 
Quickly (which is the way he did most things), he took out a power ring and
ultra-juiced toward the center of Robotropolis.  

As he entered Robotropolis, the usual entourage of SWATBots arrived, and
began chase.  Normally, he'd be pelted by lazer fire, but this time they
only followed him.  Sonic found this odd, naturally, and came to a
temporary stop a few blocks from the flare's origin.  The SWATBots came to
a halt about 30 feet away, and floated in mid-air omniously.  They stared
at each other for a few moments.  Then, Sonic broke the silence.

"Hey, bucketheads!  Why don't you shoot me?!  I'm the Hedgehog Priority
One!  Your JOB is to shoot me!" 

The SWATBots looked at each other for a few moments, obviously relaying
information back and forth.  Then, the bot on the pursuit module closest to
him said, "Snively has overrode our programming, and has ordered all units
to pursue, but not damage or terminate Hedgehog Priority One."

Sonic looked puzzled.  "Why?"

"Unknown," the 'bot said.

"Way Past Weird," Sonic thought, "maybe Snively's captured Joseph, and
wants me as ransom."

With that, Sonic took off again, toward the center of Robotropolis.  A
second later, the 'bots took off after him.

Joseph was beating Snively's head against a wall to sedate him when Sonic
arrived seconds later, being trailed by the oddly non-violent SWATBots.
Sonic's view of the situation changed rapidly after that.  "Yo, Joe!" he
shouted, and ran closer to the orange doppleganger.

Joseph stopped clobbering Snively for a moment, and allowed his stunned
body to slump to the ground.  "Hey, Sonic."

Sonic looked at Joseph, then at Snively.  "I see you've been busy," Sonic
smirked, "but you didn't leave a lot for me to play with!"

Joseph shrugged.  "The opportunity presented itself, so I seized it."

Sonic kicked Snively lightly in the chest, which didn't seem to phase him.
"Looks like he's just about ready to die."

"You want to do the honors, Sonic?"

"Huh?"

"Do you," Joseph plainly spoke, "want to finish him off?"

Sonic looked at Joseph strangely.  "You mean..."

"Kill him.  Yes."

Sonic's face went blank as he considered this.  If he killed Snively, it
would finally put an end to all of Robotnik's legacy in one blow.  No more
roboticized people.  No more pointless deaths.  The world could be
beautiful and clean again.  Joseph would make a deroboticizer, Uncle Chuck
and Bunnie and everyone else would be well again, and they'd find a way to
bring back King Acorn.  And everything would be beautiful and clean again.

But Sonic had never killed anything before.  He didn't think he could....

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

He remembered when he was a young hedgehog, and he'd built a small rabbit
trap.  He'd built it because he'd overheard Uncle Chuck complaining to one
of his friends about how rabbits kept getting through the fence he'd built
somehow, and eating his produce.  So, Sonic decided he'd make Unc Chuck
proud of him, and kill the rabbit that kept getting in the next time it
tried.  He thought of the proper way of constructing such a trap, collected
enough stuff to make it out of, and snuck into Uncle Chuck's workshop to
build it.

He'd been proud of that trap, he recalled, and he'd tested it throughly to
be sure it'd work.  It was a small wooden cage, held together with bits of
twine.  The front of it opened up with hinges, and a small stick would hold
it up.  A little piece of string could then be attached to it, and close
the cage.  In retrospect, it was a pathetic, primitive device, but it did
the job...

He'd set it out in the back yard, in the middle of the garden.  In it, he'd
put a carrot, covered with a layer of peanut butter.  (Uncle Chuck had told
him once that small animals loved the taste of it, so Sonic put it on as
additional `bait'.)  Then, he covered the string with a thin layer of dirt,
so to be sure the animal couldn't see it, and hid in a bush.

About 15 minutes later, the rabbit hopped into the yard.  It sniffed
around, nibbled on some lettuce, and then noticed the peanut-butter carrot.
As planned, it hopped into the cage.  The second it was all the way in, he
pulled the rope, and closed the cage.  The rabbit frantically tried to push
its way out, but it was far too weak to push open the door.  

Sonic cheered upon capturing the rabbit.  Uncle Chuck would be so proud of
him!  He'd get a few extra chili dogs for this!  But, he thought, he'd have
to finish the job.  So, he found a large rock that would eclipse the cage,
and difficultly picked it up.  By slowly walking toward the cage, he was able
to keep the rock above his head so to more easily smash the rabbit.  He
finally arrived close enough to the cage to see the rabbit.

The pathetic look in its eyes drained Sonic of its resolve.  No matter how
much vegetables it had eaten, Sonic had thought, it didn't deserve to die
for it.  He just threw the rock in the opposite direction, toward a small
creek, and ran away from the cage.

A minute or two later, he was able to find Uncle Chuck at the chili dog
stand.  He waited until he was done serving a customer, and then explained
the situation to him.

Oddly enough, Charles had said, "Sonic, I'm proud of you for not 
killing that rabbit."

Sonic blinked.  "I don't get it, Uncle Chuck.  Why?  I chickened out.  I
choked."  

Charles put his hand on his shoulder.  "Sonic, you didn't kill that rabbit
not because you're not brave, you didn't because you felt it was wrong. 
Your conscience told you not to, because you know it is wrong to kill.
That's not a bad thing.  In fact, it's good.  If more people were like you,
Mobius would be a perfect world." 

"Really?" Sonic said.

"Yes." 

And then, Uncle Chuck gave him a hug, and they walked back to his
garden.  Charles picked up the cage (after commenting on its handiwork
positively) and wandered over to a neighbors' house and borrowed a small
burlap bag.  Then, he carefully dropped the contents of the cage into the
bag, and put the wooden construction down.

After that, he signaled for a PeaceBot via a special watch he had on his
arm for that purpose, and gave it some very specific instructions on what
to do with it.  The PeaceBot beeped in compliance, took the bag carefully,
and zipped off to parts unknown.

He'd remembered hearing Uncle Chuck tell him later that the rabbit was 
released on a different part of Mobius, where it wouldn't eat anyone's 
garden up.  He smiled when he remembered that Uncle Chuck had always been 
proud of him for never killing anything, and that he'd promised never to...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

But, if he didn't kill Snively, he could escape from whereever they'd put him, 
and return to Robotropolis.  Then, he'd keep hurting people and destroying
things and doing things that were Way Uncool.  Maybe he'd get lucky and
kill one of his friends.  Maybe he'd even kill Sally!  Or him!  Then,
something or other would cause Joseph to NOT make a deroboticizer, and
everyone who'd been roboticized would die...Uncle Chuck...

No, Sonic thought, he'd have to break his promise.  The cycle had to end.
If he didn't, too many more lives would be put in jeopardy.  He had the
chance, and he had to make the most of it.  

"It would be," Sonic said, "a pleasure."

With a fluid movement, he grabbed the semi-unconscious Snively by the 
collar, and threw him against the wall.  He punched him a few times in the
stomach, yelling and cursing at him the whole time.  He'd occasionally
shout out, "This is for--", nail Snively in the face, and then yell a 
name of a FF, friend, or just some innocent person who had been killed 
or roboticized.  

After a while, Sonic began to sense that Snively was just about to buy it.
He knew if he was going to complete what he had started, he had an
obligation to make it impressive.  Then, he knew what he had to do.
He curled up into a ball on the ground, and started to power up a 
Sonic Spin Dash Attack...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The rest of the FFs around arrived there seconds later.  Dulcy had returned
home, with the last load of citizens they'd get that night.  Antoine had
also been taken home as well, because he was just too mental at that time
to even join the rest of them to find out what had happened to Sonic and
Joseph.  So, just Bunnie, Sally, and Charles arrived at the scene.

Needless to say, they were surprised that Snively was nearly dead on his
feet, and his large nose (not to mention the rest of him) looked all bloody
and bruised.  However, they were more surprised to see Sonic getting ready
to do a Sonic Spin Dash Attack right into him!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Charles knew he had only seconds to act.  While the rest of them were simply
struck dumb with shock, he rushed toward Sonic and shouted "STOP!"

The shout distracted the hedgehog just long enough for him to slow down
to a low enough speed so Charles could rush into him to knock him over.  
"No, Sonic!"

This was one of the times Sonic was simply struck speechless.  He tried to
form a complete sentence explaining why he was about to kill an Enemy of
the State, that it was worth a life to save a million others, etc, but he
simply could open and shut his mouth and make the articulate conjunction, 
"Uhh...".

But Charles was far more verbal.  "Sonic, it is not for you to decide who
lives or dies!  I don't care if Snively *has* nearly destroyed this world,
and I wouldn't care if Robotnik was in the same position Snively is in!
Killing is wrong!  It would make you no better than Robotnik to destroy
this pitiful creature!"  He pointed at the area that Snively was occupying.
"We will take him back to Knothole, and--"

But when he, and everyone else who had been intently listening to Charles, 
turned to look at the spot he was pointing at, he was gone!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sonic broke the silence with "Oh, man..." 

"Where'd the smeg he'd go?" Joseph said.

"Never mind that," Sally said, "we better get out of here before he finds
out where the...uh...smeg WE went!"

"Agreed," Charles said nervously, "we can discuss this back at Knothole in
the morning."

Sonic, silently damning himself for blowing it, let everyone join hands,
each person linking to another in a chain, and grabbed the last link in the
chain, Sally.  He looked back, checked that everyone was attached, and took
a ring from his backpack.

He looked at Joseph, but said nothing.  Joseph understood his silence, and
spoke softly.  "No, Sonic, I'll run interference," he said to the blue (in
more ways than one now) version of his body, "You just get everyone 
safely back to Knothole."

The hedgehogs nodded, and Sonic fired up the ring, albeit grimly, 
and took off out of Robotropolis.  Distant lazer fire was heard seconds
later, but none of it seemed to hit its mark, as usual.

However, Joseph chose to stay behind not to run interference, but to get
the rock that he had taken out of Snively's weapon.  He grabbed it from the
backseat of the idling hovercraft, and examined it closely for the first
time.  Within seconds, he realized exactly what it was; Snively had somehow
gotten the Amber Chaos Emerald from somewhere.  He didn't even want to
guess, tho.  What was important now was that he had it, not him.  

He was already thinking of all the good ways he could use it when lazer
fire started raining toward him.  SWATBots!  Now he was in `the deep
merde', as Antoine might have called it.  He quickly turned on the hedgehog
drive, and zipped away at a rapid pace.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, a familiar figure was tapping some buttons on Robotnik's chair,
and ordering various SWATBot batallions out to capture the stone from the
orange hedgehog...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Joseph dodged the lazer fire as best he could.  He wondered how Snively had
recovered so quickly.  Or perhaps this was an automatic program in case of
the injury of either Robotnik or Snively.  He didn't know, and didn't care
a whole lot at the moment, either.   

He tried to devise a plan of escape.  If he could get free of Robotropolis
proper, then he could lose the 'bots in the maze of garbage.  The only
problem was that there were a LOT of SWATBots left, and Joseph couldn't
stop to fight them, or risk the Chaos Emerald falling back into Snively's 
hands.  

He continued to dodge some 'bot plane fire and the pursuing platoon of 
SWATBots.  He was able to trick one of them into flying into a wall, and
another by splitting it in twain on the corner of a building.  But there
were still a lot of them around!  And they were *gaining* on him!

Quickly, he knew he had to really throw on the speed, or be overtaken by
the SWATBots.  But how?  He didn't have a power ring or anything.  He
certainly couldn't fly away; he had neglected to bring his antigrav belt.
Returning fire was right out because he was plasma cannonless.  And
surrendering meant death.

Then, he remembered the glowing Chaos Emerald he had in his hand.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sonic had told him a week or two ago how he fired up a power ring.
"It's like...well, imagine having a chili dog in your right hand."
He lifted up his hand to demonstrate.  "Now, imagine the dog's chili and
sauce starting to run over your hand.  That's the energy from the ring.
Now, you certainly can't *eat* the power ring...it'd blow off your jaw." 
He smirked.  "Besides, they don't taste very good."

He lifted his empty hand higher in the air, like he'd hold a power ring in
his hand.  "Now, try to imagine the chili starting to run down your arm,"
he said, starting to trace the path with his left hand. "tingling over 
your forearm, elbow, and finally all the way to your armpit."  He paused to
let this sink in, and moved on.  "After it's covered your arm, imagine the
flow of chili starting to move down your ribs, becoming stronger after
jumpin' over each one.  After that, have it fall down your stomach, and
finally have it dribble down your leg."

Sonic resumed a more relaxed posture.  "After that, your body should
probably take over.  It's reflex to me, but you should be able to do it
right one day.  It's a Way Past Cool feeling, like you're a big blue--" 
He smirked.  "--well, orange, in your case.  A big, orange lightning bolt."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

And if that could be done with a power ring, he thought...

As Joseph ran, he began to lift the emerald above his head, in his right
hand.  He imagined the chili dog....

The figure in the chair watched the orange hedgehog lift the emerald above
his head, seeming to begin some sort of meditation ritual.  The figure
wondered what the hedgehog was trying to do.

As he began to visualize the chili dog beginning to drip down his hand, the
emerald began to glow brighter and brighter...seeming to power up for
the occasion.

The person in the chair was entranced by the brighter-glowing emerald. 
Could it be that a Chaos Emerald could also be used as a power source for
organic beings?

Down his arm....and the emerald's light went from orange to yellow to green
to blue to indigo to violet and beyond in under a second.  "Wow," Joseph
said, and continued to visualize the chili dog exercize.

The figure quickly kept up with the emerald's frequencies, altering the
scanning units to counter.

He imagined the power flowing down to his ribs, lapping over each one.
The emerald was now giving off strong x-rays.  This was beginning to
frighten him.  But he could not stop.  Even if there weren't any SWATBots
chasing him, the feeling was intoxicating.  He was high on the sheer amount
of power he had in the palm of his hand.

The figure was glued to the screens.  The level of power from the emerald
was far higher than had ever been calculated in such a small crystal.  
It could be even more powerful than the total collective energy from the
Mobian sun...

When the energy rolled onto his stomach, the crystal started giving off
gamma rays.  If it wasn't for the fact Joseph's body was designed to be
spaceworthy, it would have instantly killed him.  This led him to the
conclusion that only he would be able to safely use the emerald in this
way.  Of course, he was too busy trying not to fly into a dead end to mull
that thought over further.

The figure was passionately awaiting what would happen next.  The SWATBots
had almost steered the hedgehog right into a dead end, where'd he either
stop, or become a greasy spot on a wall.  Either way, he'd get what he
wanted.  He laughed at the simplicity of it all...

Joseph kept running.  The final stage of powering up must take the longest,
he noted, and ran down an alley.  

Oh no.

The alley ended in a wall.  There wasn't enough room to turn around.  The
SWATBots were pursuing him, and were now firing at him with extreme
prejustice.  

The power hit his legs.

The wall stretched before him now, and in one second he'd--

All reality snapped away in one blast of light.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The figure in the control room screamed, and pounded his fists against the
armsrests.  No!  That was impossible!  Nobody could bend reality!  How?!
Why?!  He couldn't think of an answer, which even made him madder, and just
contented himself with screaming, and bludgeoning things.

The hedgehog had powered up the crystal to a level that his instruments
couldn't even measure, been surrounded by an ultra-powerful version of
Sonic's usual nova effect, and shot *through* reality.  The wall had
literally bent IN, and he had blasted through it.  A second later, the wall
had normalized, like nothing had even happened, and his platoon of SWATBots
slammed into it, destroying them instantly.

The night had been a tour de' force by the Freedom Fighters.  They'd not
only gotten about 25% of the remaining Worker-Bots out of Robotropolis, but
they'd destroyed a few good refinaries and somehow (and the figure had no
explaination for this) downloaded the sum of the main computer's knowledge.

That fact just made him madder.  And the figure didn't even have a Chaos
Emerald left to experiment on, to boot!

However, even this horrid experience had an upside.  He smirked
unpleasantly as he turned the chair around, toward a slab in the back of
the room.  The figure looked over at the unconscious form of Snively, who
occupying the slab, and was plotting a way to give Snively a very, 
VERY unpleasant surprise when he woke up....

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, back at the ranch:

Everyone had arrived back at Knothole but Joseph.  The night's activity had
exhausted the Freedom Fighters, and they still had to instruct the new
rescuees on basic procedure.  But that could wait until the morning.
They gave all who needed it temporary lodging somewhere, reunited as many
families as possible, and put the rest of the village to sleep.

Two hedgehogs, however, were still awake.  They sat by the Power Ring pool,
staring out at the ripples that formed in the water.  Occasionally, one of
them would skip a rock over the surface of the liquid, attempting to break
the tension.

After a while, one of the hedgehogs spoke.  "Sonic?"

Sonic nodded.  "Yeah, Unc?"

"Do you want to talk about this now?"

Hesisitation.  "Well, if you want to."

Charles coughed.  "Yes, I do."  He paused.  "I'm not angry at you, boy. 
Not in the least.  If I had been in your place, and Joseph had given me the
option, I would have done the same thing.  It was just that I didn't expect
you to think of doing that..."

He sighed.  "In retrospect, I suppose killing Snively might have been a
feasible option; seeing that he escaped somehow.  However, I still feel it
would have been morally wrong to do so, no matter how evil he is."

Sonic put his face in his hands.  "I'm confused."

Charles put his hand on the hedgehog's shoulder.  "Boy, so am I.  These
kind of situations are always the worst.  This war....god, this war...it's
starting to take its toll on you kids.  I wouldn't wish the position you've
been in on Robotnik.  All this death.  I'm surprised you didn't crack
earlier; you've had the opportunity countless times, when you could have
just killed Robotnik and/or Snively, and ended it."

Sonic mumbled, "It was because...because I would have endangered others if
I woulda killed 'BUTT-nik or Snotley in those situations.  Yeah, I coulda 
spin-dashed 'BUTT-nik open, and finished off Snively a few times, but I
always had to save someone else, or stop a berzerk machine from destroying
somethin' important.  This time, I had a Way Past Clear shot, and I knew I
might not get another."

Charles nodded.  "Sonic, it's okay...everyone is entitled to act on impulse
occasionally--" 

Sonic stood up and angrily pointed to himself.  "But I let you down!  
I became as bad as Robotnik when I got pumped up to kill!"

Charles' eyes glowed a surprised red.  "You certainly did not!  Your father
would have done the same thing, and he was the finest man I ever knew!"

Sonic's resolve fell as Charles said this.  "H-he would?"

"Yes, he would have.  Your father was so much like you, boy, that I
sometimes have to remind myself not to call you by his name."

Sonic dazedly sat back on the ground, and stared back over the water.  
"Everything's gone crazy."

Charles scooted closer to Sonic, and gave him a hug.  "It will be right
again some day, boy.  It will."

Sonic whimpered softly, and let his head fall upon Charles' shoulder.
"But what if I go crazy like that again?  What if I lose control, and--"

Charles comforted the confused hedgehog.  "You won't."

Nothing more needed to be said.  Nothing more could be said.  All that was
left for Charles to do was to hold his nephew in his arms, watch the sun
rise in the east, and make him right again...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

It was the gap between realities.  It had been called the `Void' by some,
`Creation' by others.  But it was everywhere and nowhere, at alltime and
notime.  It was the universal nexus, where all dimentions combined.
This is where Joseph found himself after breaking through the alley wall.

He drifted through nothingness for a moment while the emerald idled down.
It took an incredible strain on him, but he was able to return the mighty
object to orange status again.  He felt weak, and he so wanted to sleep...

He saw the floating crystal `iceberg' a few miles....feet....inches? 
Length, width, height, volume, mass, location; they meant nothing here.
Everything was as close as anything else in this strange semi-universe.
Either way, he drifted for some period of time before finally pulling
himself onto it.

He looked around.  There was a small crystalline home here.  He wondered
what else could survive in this odd omnispace...he walked over to the door,
and knocked upon it a few times.  A voice.  "Hold on, Nagus, I'm coming."
So there were at least two other people here, he thought, and stepped a
polite distance away.  The door opened.

He looked at the figure.  He was dressed in a outfit that looked like it'd
seen better days.  It was kind of ratty, and there were stains on the
lapels from what looked like a few years of dinners.  Yet, it appeared to
have once been regal, and it denoted authority.  The figure was tall for a
Mobian fox, about 4' something rather than the usual 3'.  He had a
tarnished, dented crown on, and his eyes gave the impression he'd been to
Hell and back again on several occasions.

"You aren't Nagus," he said, evaluating the strange creature.  "Who are
you?  How did you get here?"

Joseph bowed.  "Greetings, citizen.  I am Joseph.  I seem to have ran a
hole through the time/space continuum.  Would you have any idea how to
leave this strange world?"

"That depends," he said, intrigued.  "Where did you come from."

"Mobius, specifically around Robotropolis.  Time 'round 3237."

The figure was surprised.  "Oh?  Well, I'm from Mobius too.  In fact,
I'm--" 

"Look," Joseph interrupted, "excuse my rudeness, but it's vital I get back
to Mobius before my friends start panicking and go back to Robotropolis to
look for me.  You understand, right?"

The figure looked a bit hurt, but quickly got over it.  "Yes, yes, of
course.  Now," He pointed to a bluish hole on the horizon.  "go over to
that hole, and run through it as fast as you can.  And KEEP running through
it.  After a minute, you'll pop out in the Great Unknown.  The Great Forest
is to the east."

Joseph nodded.  "Thanks, citizen!"

"Please," the figure smiled, "just call me Acorn!"

While running off, Joseph smiled, and yelled back, "Sure, Acorn!  See you
some other time!"  With that, he fired up the crystal, and shot through the
hole as fast as he could.

As the figure zoomed out of sight, King Acorn smiled.  "Oh, you will,
orange one.  You will."  Then, he walked back into his hut, and closed the
door quietly behind him, leaving no evidence of any activity there at all.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Snively groggily awoke on the cold, hard steel plate in the back of the
semi-operational control center.  He pulled himself to a sitting position,
and hopped off the uncomfortable table.  He rubbed his head.  The hedgehog
had beaten the crap out of him.  He wondered how or why he had either
escaped from them, or was rescued...

He walked over to the wall-intercom, and pushed the button.  "Please send
some aspirin up to the command center, anyone."  It beeped, noted the
order, and set to work delivering it.

He walked over to the drink dispenser and poured himself a cold glass of
water.  Chugging it rapidly, he felt some of his memory returning....

He'd been tottering on his feet while Charles was yelling at Sonic for
attempting to kill him, with the unknown orange hedgehog looking on.
Then, someone had snuck up behind him and roughly grabbed him, pulling him
into the shadows.  He remembered someone ordering a SWATBot battalion out
to capture the Freedom Fighters--

"Hello, Needlenose!" a too-familiar voice shouted.

Uh-oh.

He turned around to look for the source of the voice, and saw someone he
did NOT want to see.  He screamed upon recognizing the evil features of...
Commander Packbell?!

"Miss me?"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

			     THE END...?

In response to this passage:

>> However, 
for the king, if you remember the Sonic second season episode, "The Void", 
when they brought back the king, he started to turn into crystal. So, to save

his life, they had to send him back.<<<

The crystalization occurred because King Acorn spent way too much time in the
void, more than two TV seasons!  In that episode, Sonic, Sally, and Bunnie
got back safely because their visit was short, and their bodies didn't have
the chance to adjust to the void's effects, unlike Nagus and His Majesty, who
found the sudden change in enviroment too much for their well-re-adjusted
bodies.  It is just the same reason why you'll won't find a crystal Robotnik
statue where Lard-butt stands comes Sonic #31.

However, there are some alternatives being thought up to bypass this
problem......

Most scripts not written by the employees of the studio or producer are 
written "on spec" in hopes of finding a buyer.  They are owned by the 
screenwriter until sold and beyond the studio's control.  The use of 
copyrighted characters (like Sonic) would make it hard for the spec 
writer to do much with the script if it is rejected.  Normally, a script 
written by an employee is a "work for hire" and automatically owned by 
the employer.  If a studio or producer hires a freelance writer not 
intending for them to be an employee, it's negotiable.  The studio or 
producer will probably want to prepurchase the script (they wouldn't have 
asked that writer if they didn't have enough confidence in him/her), but 
the writer could ask to retain ownership until the studio has decided to 
buy and has paid at least xx%.  A writer may be able to negotiate a 
"right of first refusal" where the studio that asked him/her is 
guaranteed to have the first opportunity to buy, and if they say no, the 
writer is immediately free to try to sell the script to someone else.

Perhaps Robotnik has encountered some problem that he alone is not able to 
handle. So, he maybe trying to bring back Nagus to help him with this 
problem, whatever it is. Hypothetically speaking, of course. ;-)

After the session of polymorphing that Naugus put him through, which both 
Snivley and all of us found quite amusing, I seriously douby Crazy Ivo 
would wanna be within ten miles of that wacky sorcerer ever again. :)

Hi, Erich:

I just assumed that the message would automatically go out to those on the
mailing list.  I guess I don't know how to get it to the mailing list.  If
you could please explain this to me, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thank you.

BAURLE:

As I mentioned to Erich, I assumed that posting the info to the newsgrooup
would automatically get the message forwarded to the mailing list.  I don't
know how to get it direct to the mailing list.  How do I do this, for future
reference?

Thanks!

Beats me; I think there are ways to gate a newsgroup to a list and vice 
versa, but I'm not enough of an Internet/Usenet geek to know how to set 
them up.  There used to be an email gateway through utexas.edu, but as I 
recently posted to the list, it's been removed :^(  Pity, because that way 
you could have e-mailed the same post to both the list and the group.

I use the xvnews newsreader, and it recently added a feature where you can 
both post and e-mail at the same time, which is what I use to forward stuff 
from a.f.sh to the list (by reposting it to the junk newsgroup).

I received my subscription copy of Sonic #29 Oct. 30. Of course, I 
already had picked up a copy at Another Dimension Comics about 3 weeks ago.

As for #30, "I'm waiting..."  Time to renew my subscription for #31, too!

Fellow Freedom Fighters, please don't do what this weiner tells you to. 
For one thing, Ponzi schemes haven't been legal in several hundred years.
Another, I hate spammers by general principle, especially those who fill up
*mailing lists* with this sort of garbage.

The best thing to do, which I have already done, is to send a complaint
to root@quito.digi-net.com and postmaster@quito.digi-net.com, and tell them
of this user's inappropriate behavior.

Thanks,
