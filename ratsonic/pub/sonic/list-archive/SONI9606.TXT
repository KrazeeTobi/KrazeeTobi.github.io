Well, I have noticed this in the past. However, I've also found that most
publishers have frequent delays in one form or another. Whether it's a
problem with the publisher itself, or a book's distribution, there are
delays. I've had titles delayed for over 2 months in the past, due to floods
and complete failures in computer systems. (Most frequent with small
publishers.) Archie isn't alone in this respect. In my experience, their
record for releasing titles has been okay.

I was noticing those annoying posts by that person, and wondering why the
list admin wasn't doing anything, then I realized, I'm the list admin! 

I know that sounds like a joke, but Erich is really the list admin, but he's
temporarliy off the net until he gets a new motherboard.

You guys have no idea how close I am to shutting down this list.
With every stupid post, I get closer to that point.
I'm not talking about that rude obnoxious guy, I'm talking about the 
regular posters. If all you have to say is "thanks", it's noise.

There just isn't any reason for this list if it's going to be filled with
useless crap.

Something you should keep in mind, is there is a newsgroup for Sonic called
alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog
so I don't feel all that bad about shutting this down.

Well, I've been thinking about this for quite some time now, and I've
decided to throw out a few more assumptions of continent alternates...

Great Continent = America (shoot, look at Sonic... he's blue with red & white
sneaks! ;)
Robotropolis = A really bad Washington D.C  ;-D
Downunda = Australia
Frozen North Sea = Umm... Greenland? I'd say Antarctica, but that's South...
Floating Island = Egypt

Here's some cultures...

Echidna = Egyptian
Wolf Pack = Indian
Arctic Mobians = Eskimo (who ELSE lives in the arctic?!)

But there's one thing about all this that bothers me. The Floating Island,
although Egyptianish, came from Downunda. However, no one ever said that the
continents on Mobius had to be exactly identical in location to those on
Earth.

Now about evolution... as most of you know, on Earth, creatures' ability to
thrive in certain climates and locations led to their evolution. It could be
that Mobius' continental drifting was somewhat different, thus causing the
evolutionary cycle to take a different path than Earth's own...?

Well, I've always found it interesting that so many different species could
evolve at the same time, yet co-exist peacefully on Mobius. Normally, if
more than one species occupies the same place in an ecosystem, one of them
will overcome all others. If I remember my anthropology from freshman year,
this is known as the Law of Competitive Exclusion. Based on what we know
about primitive human cultures (Well...they weren't really human yet) this
has happened several times with evolved species. One species was just
totally wiped out by another. 


Of course, it's also possible that all of the species on Mobius evolved at
different times. This is most likely what will happen on Earth in the
future. Right now, humans are the only animals that can be called sentient.
However, there is one group of living things that has showed some evidence
of sentience other than us, and those are bees. But I'm straying from the
topic. 


Maybe there were separate cultures at one time on Mobius, but they must have
been completely isolated from one another in order for each one to remain in
existence without their inhabitants being conquered/destroyed/forced to
migrate by another, more powerful, empire. (Unless they were all extremely
benevolent cultures...kind of unlikely, don't you think?) We could use a few
Mobian history books on this one. :) 


Might be interesting to learn if there were some Mobian equivalent of the
Holy Roman Empire, or ancient Greece. Hedgehog emperors and
philosophers...scary. ;)

How do you know that it's not a landmass similar to Antarctica, in the
north...?  Keep in mind, continental drift COULD have occurred differently there...

Again, this can be attributable to the earliest stages of the world's
forming; perhaps "Australia" never separated from "Africa", or perhaps the
"Egyptian" culture was on the same portion of the original landmass as the "Australian"...

That's another theory...or rather, another version of the same one.

After thinking about it more, I think I'd like to shut the sonic list down.
I'll shut it down this weekend, so you all have a week to say your goodbyes
or whatever.

The list started on 2/95, back when new episodes of the sat AM cartoon 
were being made, and we had lots to talk about. The Sat AM cartoon is 
actually what got me personally into it, and motivated me to start this.
But now, all we've got left is fanfic, and the comics. I just don't feel 
it's worth it reading this list anymore. And come on, if you've read some 
of the recent posts, you're probably agreeing with me.

Those are my reasons, and this is not open for debate.

And I do encourage you to use the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog newsgroup. If your
internet provider does not carry it, tell them to! It's very easy to add
newsgroups, so they have no excuse.

It would please me very much (and many others, I'm sure), that people
talking about DOOM, would have their OWN conversation about this off a LIST
talking about SONIC!  And please stop repling to the same letter 5 times a
day.  It annoys us all to death.

Isn't that a bit overreacting?

Will list-admin Erich be back by then?  But if it's your machine/account,
I guess it doesn't matter...

Well, that's what the delete command is for, but I can't argue with the low 
quality lately...

>Those are my reasons, and this is not open for debate.

The main things I _don't_ want to lose are Ken Penders' inputs as a Sonic 
writer/insider and Dan Drazen's reviews of the comics (even if he _was_ 
apparently the straw that broke your back just by posting a "thanks" 
comment to the list instead of taking it to e-mail...)

>And I do encourage you to use the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog newsgroup. If your

Except when they're GE and they decide to drop 90+% of the alt.* traffic 
(even though they supposedly still carry the groups).  I really can't blame 
them, since it's not related to business stuff.  However, since all I have 
is a 286 system at home, I'm not going to upgrade to a 486 with Windows just 
so I can sign up with somebody like AOL - I'll go back to my genealogy hobby
before I do _that_...

Maybe what I'll do is maintain my original Sonic list and expand it to 
include the "quality" regulars from this list; maybe somebody else will 
want to restart it up as a regular mailing list again sometime...

Well, it's been fun, but I guess nothing lasts forever except the love of God;
bye everybody...

Due to the list shutting down, if anyone has any questions or wishes to
comment on the SONIC comics published by Archie, you may write to me at

              KenP7672@Aol.com

One note: because of my position as writer on the SONIC and SONIC-related
series, I cannot read or comment on any fan-fiction whatsoever. My apologies
for this, but I'm sure the reasons are obvious.

OK, then I bring this question up: How are the writers to going ot be able
ot get people to check out their stories, if there is no mailing list? how
are others to know when new stories are added? And, where are we to direct
them to? Bookshire? I would like someday to have some kinda network to where
the writers and the person running the web page can keep in touch.

I'd also like to say it wasn't anyone's fault that I shut down the list. I'm
not mad at anyone (except for that jerk that posted all those annoying posts
who I kicked off).
So no need to write me with an apology. 

On a seperate note......

Use alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog
This brings up something I should meantion that I am aware of. Not everyone
gets the sonic newsgroup. But it is at a lot of places.

bookshire (bookshire@rat.org) does maintain a fanfic page, and stories have
always gone to him. 
As far as a network for keeping in touch with the guy that runs the web 
page, talk to bookshire.

To what? This isn't a reflex action to an event. This is me thinking long and
hard about do I really want to continue to spend the time maintaining the
list, and devoting resources on my server for it.

I don't know what his status is. And it's not his decision anyway.

Not really. Ken was one of the more informative posters. I've always enjoyed
his posts. The "thanks" post was an exception, and was annoying, but
certainly didn't have anything to do with me shutting down the list. 

It was not anyone's fault, this is just me. So if someone should be blamed,
blame me. This is my server, and I'm pulling the plug on the mailing list.

You're not alone. Many servers don't carry alt.fan.*, in which case no amount
of begging will help. I was thinking of the ISP I work for when I said that.
All a customer has to do is ask to get a newsgroup added to our server.  But
in an environment where they ban a whole news hierarchy (did I spell that
right?), there isn't much you can do about it.

That could be cool, if done right.
In case anyone is curious, there are 109 members of the main list, and 5 
people on the digest version.

I think the title says it all.  At least the service provider I'm going to
be using this summer carries alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.  Thanks for
creating and running the list, Ratman.


BTW-Will the sonic link remain on http://rat.org?  I'd hate to lose access
to all that fanfic I haven't yet read.

THIS, Rat, is a low blow.  I JUST GOT BACK, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD, AND NOW
THIS!!!  Now, I know I said I'd try not to attack your authority or
anything like that, but the Mettle thing I got kicked-off for had a real
REASON, whereas THIS...well, I don't see one here.  This whole THING is
ridiculous...whether they have an excuse or NOT, some people just aren't
going to CARRY a.f.s-h, whereas EVERYBODY'S got E-MAIL.  In any case,
there's nothing I can do to STOP you, but STILL, this is ridiculous.

Yes, I KNOW I posted this to the list, but I assumed that THIS topic is
something important, with which the other users would agree.

That will stay.
And bookshire runs the fanfic page, please remember that. It's up to him 
if he wants to shut it down ever.

It is ridiculous for you to assume that I owe you this service. Lack of
appreciation like this makes me wish I had shut it down sooner. Though I can
only hope you and your attitude is in the minority.

It doesn't matter anyway since the list is going away soon.

         Totally off the subject, but there's already four Doom novels 
out in bookstores. Nothing involving Sonic in there, though. ;-)

<Sighs> I'm sorry...you're right, you have every right to close down.  I
just tend to get angry when I lose things that are important to me...sorry
for losing it yet again.  I've had a good time...thanks, Rat, and everybody

Well i do try my best. ANY way, it involves nothing from the doom section.
I just liked the name and I used it. Here is the first two Paragraphs from
TTH:KDITD

       As the bright transluminicant after glow of Mobius's moon cast it's
yellowish white light across an apparently abandoned junkyard. A few
unnamed animals quickly skittered across the trash filled road. One of them
, which wasn't paying too much attention to the road ahead of him, bumped
into a now dented beverage can. If he could talk then you would most likely
hear a stream of cursing and death threats. The ominous sound of the wind
howled wrathfully, leaving an eerie feeling in the air. The wind blew
harder.

        The stronger gust of wind caused the massive steel cables of a
ruined wrecking crane to gently sway back and forth. The twisted red metal
crane arm hung there, lifeless and limp. Several steel cables and long
yellow hazard wires hung from one of many damaged ventilation openings. It
almost looked like a large robot arm, waiting to have its synthetic 'veins'
to be put back in place. Every few minutes several pieces of the cranes arm
would fall to the ground in a loud metallic shriek.

     This message, most likely my last, on this mailing list, is not going
to be an extremely `friendly' one.  Those of you out there with sensitive
dispositions, or an aversion to out-and-out rage, may wish to discontinue
reading this self-professed rant at the conclusion of this paragraph.
This has been something that has been held within me for several months
now, and the time has come for it to be released.
 
     I have sat on this list and read every message that has come through
for probably the last six or seven months.  During that time, not only have
I been relatively inactive in my posting, but also have repressed a lot
of anger and sorrow over the actions of its sysops, especially `Ratman'.
My reasons for holding back my hate and venom are rather simple to trace,
really; since I did not want my close relationship with Bookshire to
be viewed by Ratman as a conspiracy against him, I chose not to endanger
Bookshire's fanfic archive or his graphics page by complaining about said
sysop's activities.  But now, this hostile action toward the Sonic fanfic
community has forced me to react in a firm and unforgiving way, and for
me to present my case to the people to the best of my ability.
 
     Some of you new to the list may be wondering what events and
statements made by said hominid rodent have brought me to make this
rather brash and probably inflammatory diatribe against him (as well
as a brief gripe about something Eric, the other sysop, had done).
Therefore, in the interests of presenting my complaints in an itemized
and logical form, I shall attempt to list the major offenses below.
Some other occurrances also led to my current anger, but they have
either been forgotten or have been of such a small consequence that
listing every one would be trivial.
 
    The first event that turned me toward dislike of the management of
this list is one that could probably be concieved as a nearly inflammatory
move on the part of Eric, which was to utilize a posting of mine in order
to set down a new `list rule'.  What transpired was that in the beginning
of my fanfic-writing career, I made it a habit to publish my stories
on the mailing list directly, and then have Bookshire grep them from his
mailspool and HTMLize it for fanfic-page consumption.  I had not seen a
single post on said list about anyone disliking my practice of doing this,
and had, in fact, recieved a few positive comments.  This not only
encouragedme to continue my writings, but it also gave me a mandate to
continue this practice further.  Well, after I had sent one of my stories 
to the list on one fateful afternoon, Eric decided to take the opportunity 
to put down a new list rule.  Can anyone tell me what it is?  No?  
Well, it was that no further stories were to be sent to the list.  He used 
the header of my posting, deleted all of the content of the message (even 
the `On such-and-such day, X said:' line), and said in no uncertain terms that
no further fanfic was to be sent to the list.  That's all.  No `good
story, Joe', no `awful story, Joe', no `nice paragraphing, Joe', but
instead a subtle incrimination that it was -MY- fault that this new
policy was being instituted.  Real fucking nice, man.  Yet, I kept
my mouth closed, and instead did what I was instructed to.  The deep-rooted
indignation that I possess now was absent in me then, so I meekly shut up
and obeyed.
 
     However, my ire was rose when people CONTINUED, -TOTALLY- unflamed,
to post fanfic to the list (and multi-part fanfic, I might add) and were,
in fact, APPLAUDED by the admins!
 
     The second incident that rose my bile to a frothing cauldron of rage
was a posting I had made that I thought was not only Sonic-related, but
dealt with the problem we had at the time with Sega's legal staff regarding
the `hentai' pics Bookshire had on the page at the time.  A posting on
alt.slack caught my eye during that time period that dealt with a similar
case that Warner Brothers was placing against a similar collection of
porno pics of toons.  Seeing that this would be a good morale-booster
for the depressed inhabitants on the list, I chose to grep the article
from my local NNTP server, edit it a little, and post it onto the list.
It seemed quite obvious to myself and my close friends that this was
a completely on-topic post, and it would be, in fact, appreciated by
all members of the list.
 
     As expected, Ratman (with his utter mastery of the King's English,
not to mention his totally superior abilities in detecting -CONTEXT-)
*flamed* me for putting the article on the list, calling it one of the
most foul, odious, noxious, degrading, and generally Pink things that
one 'net surfer can call another 'net surfer's transmissions: `spam'.
Needless to say, it took a far larger expenditure of willpower to not
utterly blast Ratman off the face of the earth with my verbal gymnastics,
but I was able to again contain my rage.
 
     The third slap in the face that I refused to allow my primal instincts
to attack was not even directed toward me, but rather toward the
inhabitantsof the list as a whole.  This was an incident best outlined as a
general`policy' issue, but it was a very sensitive one for me.  Now, I know
operators of mailing lists have the right to say whatever they want on
the list that they operate.  I have no qualms about that right, nor would
I demand it be removed due to the interests of fair and free speech.
However, during an otherwise slow time for the list, an interesting,
but somewhat off-topic thread began; it dealt with the fanfic video game
(that is still under production, BTW), and the general roles people might
play in it.  I thought it was amusing enough, and didn't feel it took up
too much of my mail spool with BS.  After all, it is a simple thing to
delete 30 messages a day; any jackass with a decent mail-reader can do
that in one keystroke.  Yet, after a while, Ratman started bitching about
it because he had obviously lost interest in it.  There was a brief
verbal scuffle, which can be supported by said members of the discussion,
and I felt that neither side was totally in the right...in fact, if it
hadn't been for Ratman's creation of a video-game list, I bet this list
would have finally collapsed a long time ago.  But it takes two to tango,
petit, and this therefore can be seen as yet another reason I am 
unhappy with Ratman's performance.
 
     Fourth was perpetrated by Ratman just hours ago, when he had the
sheer gonads to dare speak afoul of one of the most brilliant,
skilled, and generally superior human beings I have had the pleasure of
reviewing the work of, Dan Drazen.  He is probably one of the nicest
people I have ever read the work of, and does more for Sonic fandom
in general than most people could ever concieve of.  His writings about
the Sonic comic are insightful and fair, and his fanfic is probably
several million times better than anything I could ever dream of writing.
In fact, I'd dare say that he could write `Nanny nanny boo boo' a million
times, post it, and I'd -still- like the guy.
 
     But, as Ratman was totally expected to do (I was tempted to start
a pool when I saw Drazen's alledgedly `irritating' post), he went off
on this great man like he was a common spammer, dissing him far too
strongly in front of the entire list for acknoledging a quite...interesting
comment written by an obvious nutcase.  He should have been commended for
adding even a spittle of thought toward that individual, not crucified and
chastised by the hominid rodentia for making a minor `fluff' post.  It's
not like the list was overloaded with spam at the time, anyway.
 
     And now, the fifth reason is Ratman's actual shutting down of the
list for reasons that have allegedly stretched back into the past.  He
says that the system load for him is too much (sure, pal...and I suppose
the ten billon Mortal Kombat wankers that hit your site every time another
edition of that blasted game is released doesn't put an infinitesimally
higher amount of strain on that ISP of yours than some < 50 K mail messages
that are in-and-out in less than 2 minutes), and that the signal-to-noise
ratio is too low (one jerk spams us with 5 messages, and two other people
are learning how to use their mail programs...meanwhile, meaningful
discussion continues unabated), or that alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog would
be a better place, anyway (and he -admits- it's more difficult than he
initially said to get your average po'bucker admin to add a newsgroup to
your local NNTP spool, especially if it's an alt.* group...also, Quozl
himself could tell you that the average sysop is probably already wary
of the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog group because it was allegedly created by
Tom Servo-ish methods...you think getting alt.tv.k-t-e is hard to
cajole your sysop into, just wait until he sees your request for a
group that was allegedly made by Tom Servo!)
 
     Now, in my opinion, this action was taken strictly as a tantrumish
lashing-out at those of us who may have offended his sensitive
sensibilities once too often, or that one was less articulate than he would
prefer, or even just because he'd stubbed his toe that morning.  Who 
frigging knows?  All I know is that this action is totally uncalled for, 
and that any human being with a sense of justice left within them would 
stand up and -say- something about it.  His current rationale does not 
wash well with me, and I'm sure that I am not alone.
 
     In closing, I will be sure to tell others about the actions of
Ratman, sysop of rat.org, throughout my various peer groups of furries,
cyberpunks, and Wired devotees; and also see to it that a new list is
createdon a different server to serve those of us still devoted to the Blue
Guy; with a more lenient sysadmin and fairer policies toward the fanfic
writer.  Mark my words, fellow Freedom Fighters, I shall not rest until we
have a new list again.  I refuse to allow such a hard-core group fall apart
at the seams due to the actions of one misguided individual.
 
     Regards,

Well, I must admit that I'm disappointed to learn that the list is shutting
down, but I'm not going to be bitter about it. I must say that I've had a
hell of a lot of fun being on the list these past 7 months. I've met a lot
of new people by being a part of it.

Many thanks go to Ratman for giving us this really cool way to talk to each
other about Sonic. Thanks, Rat! You're an all-around Great Guy! :)

Now it's time for the shameless plug. ;)

To everybody, I will still be running #sonic on EFNet. The other ops and I
will keep the channel going, at least for the time being.(No plans to shut
it down at present.) I'd really appreciate it if more of you could show up
every now and then, especially on Saturday nights. A really active channel
is a lot more interesting than just 5 or 6 of us. So, this is my final post
to the list regarding IRC. (Or so I hope.) If you can use Internet Chat,
then come join us! :) I'm still open to questions or suggestions about this.
Any problems, please let me know.

It's been great talking to all of you guys, even though I probably qualify
as one of the lurkers when it comes to posting. ;)

 Veiws, by Suni....

 ::clapclapclap::

 Well SAID, Joe!!!

 I have to say, I signed on, and was more of a 'lurker' than a poster. I
enjoyed the fanfic (bravo, for Joe--he is very kewl, love the stories), and
manyother things....and now it goes 'way?!

 FOR THE LOVE OF DEAR GOD! This is where the writers commence, the Freedom
Fighters talk, and, we meet new friends, and now, it goes 'way.  ALL BECAUSE
SOME INCENSITIVE GUY WITH A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER DESTROY OUR MEETING GROUND.

 I'm not gonna stand for dear ole Ratty's ranting, thinkin' he can RUN the
damn joint. Just cuz the blue ribbon doesn't hang in HIS head, doesn't mean
WE can't post what we want. Spam *is* annoying, but tolerable to most. We
just trash it. Shump. Go bye-bye. 
But, no, when we WANT to talk, to respond, and to enjoy company...it goes
'way. YES, this has pissed of this lady a LITTLE TOO FAR.

 Ya know, *I* was *kicked* off the list once. After I broke a damn rule that
the KINGS (sacracsticly speakin', o'course) made up that I had no IDEA about
until I got a WONDERFUL note saying I was off the list. I wrote back, and,
after basicly GROVELING, I was let back on...

....AND NOW IT GOES 'WAY!!!

 Drawn the last straw. Dancing on my last nerve. I am mortified. We should
find our OWN way to make a damn mailin' list....

 And this time, it won't go 'way..

::like Sailor Moon::

BLLUUE....RRIIBBOON...POOWWEERR!!!!!

Good one Suni, How about all the story writes create a small mailing web.
There we can exchange stories,ideas and views. I dont know if it sounds
like a hot idea, but at least its a start.

When I found out about this list and the other Sonic fandom on the Net
about a...JEEZ-UM, A YEAR AGO?!?!?!  How time does fly...anywayz, as I was
saying, I was in heaven when I found this territory, and I'm beyond sorry
to see it go.  This has been a true meeting place, where I can converse
with those who share my interests...it's like everything I wanted Sonic
'94/'95/'96 to be, but, for various complicated reasons, it didn't turn out
as such (for one thing, it's INCREDIBLY off-topic, which is why Sir Kain
left Prodigy).  It's been great, guys.  <Bows low>  At the risk of sounding
like a hypocrite: Try not to be TOO bitter about this, guys, hard though it
may be.  The newsgroup remains, and there will be more mailing
lists...because Sonic the Hedgehog will NEVER DIE.

I know...he probably was in a bad mood, or he would've let it pass.  I
agree wholly, except I don't think his writing's several million times
better than MINE...just a couple hundred.  ;)

I'D start up a list, only that can't be done on Prodigy (YET...they might
soon; as of yesterday they started reworking the whole service).  Of
course, that might prove a TEENSE maddening for some of you out there, as
my policies are the total OPPOSITE of Rat's -- hideously liberal rather
than hideously conservative -- and I'd probably let people post whatever
they wanted, regardless of Sonic content.

In any case, what Rat's doing seems a bit outta line, but we haven't much
right to be angry, as this IS, after all, HIS turf that he's donating us.
I'd do differently in his position, but I've little room to talk as I'm not
there.

Somebody's got to do it!

THE HEDGEHOG,

I would like to step in and say my last farewell to you all before the 
list dims its lights for the umm.. final time.  *sniffle*  It was good 
getting e-mail from the list and watching the correspondence between the 
great ones and the interesting fans.  I personally would vouch for 
someone else to takeover the list since Ratman's not going to take up the 
responsbility anymore.  Thank you, Ratman, for bringing fame to my 
artwork and my archives.  I appreciate being able to contribute to your 
archives.  Psst.. keep your eyes open Sonic fans.. I am still working on 
more Sonic artwork that will be posted on the archives in the near future.

I just recently got back to Canada from Northridge, CAlifornia.. its a 
sad thing this list has to go *poof* in so short a time.

Well enough of my blabbering.  please forward any requests for my artwork 
to vboao0f2@huey.csun.edu or.... toss 'em to me at sonic4@nucleus.com

						Sonic-Fully Yours (finale)

						Bryant Melesko
						Sonic The Hedgehog
(May SONIC be alive all the time I'm alive ;^) )

I'm glad Sega came out with 'Sonic 4' which perfectly concides with my 
nick Sonic4 on irc ;^)

See ya all in #sonic!

That goes for me, too.  I won't give Ops to anyone that's not an Op on the
channel.

I'd also like to say bye to everyone, Ken, Your posts have helped and I've
always enjoyed them.  And Dan Drazen, I've always looked forward to your
reviews on Sonic comics.  This list was fun while it lasted, and I learned
lots of new things.  Yes, it is sad that this list comes to an end, and I'm
still not sure exactly why.  I hope there will be another list soon to come
where we can discuss the same things.  Bye everyone!

I am Speed's dad.  I just happened to come across a letter from the sonic
mailing list.  As a teacher, I encourage my students to write, to explore,
to expand their thinking, and to build lasting friendships in the process.
From what I saw of the mailing list the the fun things that went on in the
irc channel, I think you are all a neat bunch of people with some very
creative ideas.  I have just a couple of questions:

        1)  If you allow what has happened to ruin all of this, who really
wins?  Who learns that bullying works and who else learns what happens when
we just give up because of some insensitivity in this world?

        2) Why can't you get together collectively and solve the problem
with the cooperation of the servers and the ops?

Cooperation and communication, along with understanding seem, to me, to be
elements we cannot let go.  The response here sure seems to be
overwhelmingly in favor of working this out.  

Oh, and regarding the takeover of the irc channel.  Why not put your heads
together, communicate with the servers and FIND A WAY to make things work to
your benefit.  Look at it as a challenge which you can accept and from which
you can learn.  Do not give in so easily to defeat.

Good luck and hang in there.

Well ... it seems like this is goodbye .

I've only been on this list for two months , but I think I've met many
interesting people via this list in that short space of time .

It's kept me up-to-date on a whole Sonic world I never knew existed before
joining this list . It inspired me to start writing my own fan fictions AND
start a webpage devoted to the blue spiky one .

Thanks to all who have spent time and resources on maintaining this list .

Let me take this opportunity to make some final announcements :

1)I'm really disheartened that I have not recieved any fan fiction contributions
within the last month or so ... it looks like my Archives are a failure . :(
I will wait for the day that another fanfic graces my screen , but I think I
might be waiting in vain ...

If no fanfics come , then I will sadly terminate my Sonic Webpage and devote
the resources to other topics .

2)This is probably one of the last fan fictions I will write . It is called
Alterations and will wrap up my Foxes and Sorcery series . I *may* write one
more to conclude the Wheel series , but no confirmation as yet .

Anyone interested in "Alterations" can e-mail me directly at
prower@pacific.net.sg for a copy of it .

3)I'm really sad that this list has to go ...

To conclude , I guess all that's left to say is farewell ....

I just want to thank Ratman for bringing us this list.  I didn't agree
with some things you did, Ratman, but you did give us all access to
something wonderful.

I must admit that the list slowed down greatly toward the end.  But, if
anyone else out there starts a new Sonic mailing list, please tell me!
I'd love to join it!

Well, here's *MY* final farewells to ya all. :P

Can't say I blame Rat at all, I think I probably woulda shut it all down a
long time ago with all the stuff he's had to put up with.  And I'm sure it's
not exactly a DRAIN on his system to have the list--I read the note about
how insignificant this one list would be compared to everything else the
server does--but then, it's one MORE resource taking up the server and a LOT
less work for Rat himself to be troubled with.

Which brings me to another thing--can't say I'm sorry to see the list go.. I
used to post stuff a long time ago--when there were interesting things to
talk about.  There still are some.. but it's gotten diluted on this list
with some of the most innappropriate things and with file attaches that
would make any college student's mailbox with a shell account blow up if
left untouched for a week.  I can't understand why critisms aren't sent
directly to the admins or Rat himself, if you think there's a
problem--instead of either letting it pressure up inside or by flaming
publicly.  You know--sometimes rules are made up only AFTER things happen
because someone didn't expect those things to happen.

Anyway--Just my opinion. :)  BTW: I happen to VERY much like the way Rat
runs things, if you criticize his choices thinking that your way is the BEST
way, then I guess ya just don't realize that not EVERYONE necessarily wants
what you want.  I also saw Rat do a HECK of a lot more good for everyone
than any amount of bad anyone's listed. :P


IN CLOSING!
I'll miss MOST of you lurkers and most of the folks that posted really
interesting and useful FAQs, ideas and topics about Sonic.  Particular
greetings and thanks go out to KenP, Ratman, SirKain, Orwin, Kris Kelley (I
know he won't see this though.. sigh), OS/2 Eric (heh)... and a big BONK
onna head ta Mason. :)


G'night everyone.  Take care.. and remember...

heheh.. HADDA plug it. :)  Ciao blue-blur-buds.

Hello, My name is Jarrett, I'm a friend of Speed's, and about that op thing.
I would like for that every body gets op now. Theres no more bot on the
channle now, yet sertant people (MilesProw in paticuler) keep geting op and
let few other people use it. With no bot I don't think theres any reson we
others get op, but Miles yoused to be one of the few who always got op, so
hes diseded thats still going to happen, even though theres no bot to give
it to him, and Miles I hope your ready this ,so you know my opinuin in this
oping thing.

I'm afraid I do run the joint.
And thanks for that informative post. I'll have to reevaluate my other 
mailing lists and see if they also have the attitude that I owe them, and 
how dare I try to control it.

Yeah, what a jerk I am. I provide this free service, and do such a crappy 
job at it. Here, i'll give you a full refund.
I tell ya, I appreciate you making it easier for me to shut this thing down.
I felt kinda bad about it, but this helps make me feel better about it. 

And if this "rat bashing" becomes a trend, I think i'd like to shut it 
down right now. I'll see how it goes today and tomorrow.
But I'd rather give it the full week for people to say their goodbyes, 
and possibly advertise for other forums people can use to discuss Sonic.

So yes, this is my frigging mailing list dammit, I'm not about to sit by and
watch people band together to say what a jerk I am. You can't tell me you
wouldn't do the same thing.

Hi guys.
	I would like to express my gratitude for allowing me to be apart 
of the Sonic Discussion Group for the 8 months I served on it. I would 
like to thank you all for allowing me to contribute my time, talents, and 
effort, to help make the Sonic Discussion Group as enjoyable, and 
informative, as possible.
	Ratman, I salute you for maintinaing the group for as long as you 
have. I am truly sorry that you decided to shut it down, but I understand 
your reasoning in doing so. If I was doing something for so long, and 
wasn't getting but flak for doing so, I would quit too.	
	So...I guess this is goodbye <sniffle>. I really hate to see it 
go. But when another Sonic discussion group surfaces, you bet I'll be 
there!!! But for now, I must say farewell.

BTW. All persons who have the Sonic Code in their signatures are still 
authorized to keep it in their sigs.

It's not weather or not you feel bad.  I don't *blame* you (or 
anyone,) it's just that the list is STILL IN USE!  It's not like the

It's not a matter of me holding it over anyone's head. I'm just giving a
warning. I'd rather give people a chance than just shut it off early.  Given
a choice between watching 5 days of flames being spammed to the list, or no
posts at all, I'd choose nothing. I really just don't want to see people
whine. It's not productive. Now if someone wants to provide an alternative,
then fine, but a long-winded "ratman is a jerk" post, I'd rather avoid those. 
But I do want to give people a chance to say their goodbyes...  wait, I
already said that. Do I always have to re-explain myself?

Yikes!  Does this mean that DiC and Sega have made nice?  All the more
reason to hope that an animated film just might come together one of
these days.  My $.02 on THAT subject: PLEASE try to get Allee and
Hurst back on board to write it.  Even good vocal work can't save a lame
script.

Rat, let's be sensable: the government, (for example,) doesn't OWE us 
the privlidge to drive, (it IS a priv., federal roads and all,) but 
if you woke up tomarrow and heard an announcement, "This is Bill 
Twiton, you can no longer drive-any of you!"  Wouldn't you be a bit 
pissed?  So it's natural to assume that people WILL be pissed, or sad 
to say the least.  And why make someone sad?  Tell me how to set up a 
list and it'll become MY responsibility, if it's really too much to 
ask from you.

You don't seem to care.  You always (have had) this chip on your 
shoulder.  Mind explaining why?  I'm not trying to be mean, but I 
just want to reason this thing out, find another way for it to live 
on.  I'm trying to show dedication.  Help me this once, and it will 
forever more atone you, (no longer be your problem.)  So...?

Well, something went wrong...er, RIGHT...with Archie's
distribution system and I actually found a copy of #37 on the
newsstand on June 3.  So let me post this before the list goes
bye-bye.  Consider this your usual SPOILERS alert:



















#37 [Aug 1996]
   I'm getting tired of these covers by Spaziante...NOT!!!  Sonic
in freefall (apparently) holding Sally in his arm.  Nice design -
- call it "The Mobian Pieta."  And if you don't know what I'm
talking about, get thee to a library and read up on the
sculptures of Michelangelo [the sculptor, not the turtle!].
   "The Day Robotropolis Fell"
   Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Brian Thomas
   Sonic and Sally rendezvous with Uncle Chuck in Robotropolis,
who breaks the news to them that Robotnik has predicted that an
earthquake is going to hit the city (Excuse me, Dr. Robotnik,
some gentlemen from Cal Tech have just arrived; they keep talking
about "the big one" so I assume they mean you...).  Robotnik's
plan is to hover over the city in a giant saucer-like craft
loaded with his SWATbots until the quake ends.  He doesn't
particularly care what happens to the worker bots (i.e.,
roboticized Mobians) but Uncle Chuck does.  Uncle Chuck's plan:
while Robotnik is hovering, they enter his HQ, reactivate the
deroboticizer (gee, that's the first I've heard of it!) and treat
as many worker bots as possible before the quake hits.  This
assumes what Uncle Chuck doesn't: that Robotnik left a
comfortable margin between takeoff and the quake.  Unable to
deroboticize the Mobians one at a time, he plans to blow up the
roboticizer by overloading it, counting on the diffusion to
deroboticize the Mobians in bulk, as it were.  Sounds to me like
the scientific equivalent of supply-side economics, but never
mind.  In the resulting blast, Uncle Chuck is NOT effected while
the rest of the worker bots are.  Uncle Chuck and DeCesare don't
bother to explain how this could have happened before the next
tremor comes down the pike.  Rotor just happens to arrive with a
transport plane, but it proves to be too small.  Sally pulls rank
and orders Uncle Chuck onto the plane -- OK, so it's not exactly
the airport scene from "Casablanca."  While Sally tries to find
out from Nicole what's the best way out of Robotropolis during an
earthquake, a sizable chunk of masonry lands on top of her.  If
this weren't a comic book, she'd be a stain on the pavement; as
it is, she's unconscious and it's up to Sonic to get her out of
town.  They manage, and we eventually see Sally with her head
bandaged and her arm in a sling.  Robotnik lands and resolves to
rebuild, relying on a satellite-based force field to protect the
city during its reconstruction.
     I'll leave it to the Californians on the list as to whether
DeCesare's depiction of a quake is credible; me, I had enough
troubles with this story.  Uncle Chuck is suffering from a bad
case of logic deficiency in this one: the business with the
deroboticizer--It will be most effective if I overload it to the
point of destroying it--reminds me too much of some of the plot
problems with "Steel-Belted Sally" (#29).  There's no way ALL of
the roboticized Mobians could have converged on the deroboticizer
just in time for the explosion so some of them had to have been
victims of the quake, just as there's no way Sally could have
avoided becoming a blob of royal jelly after that masonry fell on
her.  Nor do we ever find out how Uncle Chuck escaped the effects
of the deroboticizer, or how Rotor was able to get a plane from
Deus Ex Machina Airlines into the city in time.  The premise of
the story was good, as was the artwork, but the more you think
about the plot the more it turns into a no-brainer.
     Sonic Art: I thought Brian Thomas had drawn the eyes of the
characters in "The Day Robotropolis Fell" too big--Sally
especially looked as if she belonged in a black velvet painting--
until I saw Charles Kusiak's fanart.  You could drive a TRUCK
through those pupils!
     Bunnie's Worst Nightmare
     Story and Art: Rich Koslowski[debut]
     Bunnie's first solo effort starts out with quite a premise:
What starts out as an annoying itch turns out to be a spreading
case of roboticization.  Thanks to a convenient hologram of
Robotnik to describe the plot, it turns out that Bunnie may have
been partially roboticized at one time, but a "microscopic
device" implant has started to finish the job.  On the verge of
total roboticization, she leaves Knothole.  After traveling all
night she falls asleep and wakes up to...The Old Dream Ending!
     It's a pity Rich was only given 8 pages to play with; with
another 8 pages, this could have been the story it was meant to
be.  It's not that this ground hasn't been travelled before: it
has, in everything from "The Amazing Colossal Man" to "Dr.
Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde" to the remake of "The Fly": what it's like
for someone to gradually lose their humanity (or in Bunnie's
case, to borrow a word from Richard Adams, her "animality") while
becoming something else.  If you'll allow me, here's how it could
have played:
     At first Bunnie ignores the first signs of change, though
she may even have a suspicion as to what it may mean.  This
proves the saying heard in 12 Step groups: Denial ain't just a
river in Egypt!  Then the condition continues its slow,
relentless possession of her.  I think it wouldn't be too strong
to say that, from Bunnie's point of view, this gradual takeover
of her bod must feel like slow-motion rape.  An off-hand remark
from one of her friends (spoken in innocence by Tails or in
ignorance by Antoine) lets the reader know that she's not just
turning into a machine but also into one of Robotnik's minions. 
After the obligatory note scene, she starts to leave Knothole but
is intercepted by Sally who tries one last time to talk her into
staying.  After a tearful farewell, Bunnie begins to leave, then
pauses.  Sally, ever hopeful, runs over to her, only to discover
that Bunnie's transformation is complete and that she's gone over
to the Dark Side, as it were.  She now has a new set of
priorities, the first of which is: "DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY
ORDER OF ROBOTNIK."  
     I'm not trying to brag, but I barely broke a sweat coming up
with this enhancement to the story line.  Yet I also couldn't
help but think of (if you'll allow me to get momentarily off-
topic) an episode of Disney's "Aladdin."  In this one ep, Jasmine
begins turning into a kind of serpent creature due to a spell by
Mirage, an evil being.  She and Al journey in search of a
possible cure.  When all attempts to get at the cure are foiled
by Mirage and Jasmine's transformation into a monster is
complete, Al takes it upon himself to become the same kind of
creature as she has become, for the sake of love.
     I mention this because while Rich does a good job of showing
what is happening--the plot certainly moves right along--there's
not much room in the story for all but the most superficial
treatment of Bunnie's emotional state.  Her emotional landscape
is painted only in the broadest strokes; this was the fatal flaw
that made Tails' change of heart at the end of "Southern
Crossover" [Tails miniseries #3] patently unbelievable.  Perhaps
this goes back to the question of the core audience of the comic,
but the Aladdin ep mentioned above demonstrates that it is
possible to tell such a story without dumbing it down
emotionally.  I look upon this story as eight pages of "what
might have been."  As glad as I am to see Bunnie getting a solo
shot, I really believe she deserved better.
     Sonic-Grams: hint that the theme of a devastated
Robotropolis will continue and that Sonic will become a slow-mo. 
Plug for Knuckles #2, and a hint that Sonic will finally have a
date with the Roboticizer in #39.  Cute depiction of Joe Pepitone
as Robotnik and Fred Mendez as a computer program.  Lyrics to a
Sonic song, and a couple guesses as to the identity of
Archimedes, with an actual answer!  Almost a full page of names
of readers who have written--major headache!

Will attempts to post further synopses and FAQs to the home page
whereon the Faq File resides.  Otherwise, I may actually have to
(dare I say it?) SPEND MONEY for a computer and a subscription to
CompuServe or AOL!  My current machine at home -- an XT vanilla
clone I got as a castoff from my brother-in-law -- can no longer
read its own hard drive.  And my lunch hour at work is just
about...

What can I say?

I enjoyed the discussions (for the most part), I STILL haven't figured
out how to MU* my way to Knothole, and I got to check out the trends in
fanfic while posting my own humble efforts.

Thanks to Ron for appreciating the reviews, Dave for posting my stories
(I've got a few more in development so don't turn off your homepage just
yet), Ken Penders from breaking out of Lurkerland to defend the honor of
Scott Fulop and to banish my ignorance of the funny book business, and
everyone who thought that my own attempts at stringing electrons
together made a positive contribution to the world of Sonic fanfic. 

One way or another, we'll be back.  Maybe on alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog,
maybe on some other list.  Pass the word along to rec.arts.animation
when and if something new should come to pass -- I'd suggest posting to
one of the rec.arts.comics groups but that X-Men crowd seems to have
staked it out as their territory: "There aren't enough FUNNY comics!
They're mostly scary stories with big words about these muscle people
doing nasty things to each other!" [from: "One Big Happy", 4/1/96]

For the last time (until the next time), my schmaltzy Sonic sig:

**appears from the dark shadows to voice a few thoughts**

First...my page isn't going anywhere.  I'm a little behind in a few 
things, but I still accept stories at the same address (rotor@primenet.com).
And I'll still post (or try to) any stories I get.

As for the end of this list...

Well...I can't say that I'm not sorry to see it go, because I am.  I find 
that, through all the spam and snide comments and flame wars...every now 
and again, legetimate topics popped up, as well as story, movie and game 
notices.  Not to mention several thoughts on the ways of Mobian life.

It is unfortunate that, apparently, nobdy else has a system with which to 
take of the functioning of the list. (Although there are a few things 
happening at my end right now that may allow me to swtart my own in a 
month or two...)

Anyway, so long to all...keep reading, and ESPECIALLY writing.

It's a threat, Ratman.  You're taking away a very useful communications
tool from these people already, so saying you might do it a little
early is quite a damaging thing to do.

>I'd rather give people a chance than just shut it off early.  

Your statement seems contridictory to your previous actions and statements.

>Given a choice between watching 5 days of flames being spammed to the list,
>or no posts at all, I'd choose nothing. 

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  That's a
documented scientific law, you know.

>I really just don't want to see people whine. It's not productive. 

Well, Ratman, perhaps if you weren't basically taking away several people's
friends, then maybe we'd be a little nicer to you.  After all, if I
chose to shoot you in the leg, I'd expect that you'd say something 
about it to the effect of `hey, that's not nice'.

>Now if someone wants to provide an alternative, then fine, but a 
>long-winded "ratman is a jerk" post, I'd rather avoid those. 

Ratman, if you would have read my statement, you would realize that said
message has a lot of valid points in it; and that perhaps if you took 
some of my suggestions to heart, there might be a hope that you would
realize the error of your ways and keep this list operating.  It wasn't
just a flame of you, it was a detailed list of your negative actions 
toward other people on this list that probably discouraged a lot of
the so called `on-topic' posts which you so desired.

Think about this logically for a moment, Ratman.  If people get yelled
at for posting tidbits of news relevant to Sonic fandom, posting 
fanfic stories, or participating in a thread regarding the creation
of a new kind of Sonic fandom, what's left?  Not a lot, except for
Drazen's FAQ additions and the occasional spam blitzkreig by a newbie.

>But I do want to give people a chance to say their goodbyes...  wait, I
>already said that. Do I always have to re-explain myself? 

Your statement had been noted already, Ratman.  It's just a matter of
the remainder of us being irate at your actions.

Joe.

Oh, I see.  You can do whatever the hell you feel like to me, and I gotta
keep my yap shut and take it from you?  Well, sorry, I don't allow people
to treat me in that way for very long.  It's obvious that you won't,
either.  

And I know it's so bloody hard to maintain one of these things, too.  I
used to run several remailers on a Freenet (this one, in fact) with no
shell access and only a .forward file that had to be manually edited 
when I wanted to add a new user.  Often, I'd have to transfer a file
sent to myself to the list due to misdirection on the part of the user.
You, on the other hand, have a totally automated remailer that you
occasionally take control of when someone spams it.  -You- have absolutely
no day-to-day need to operate the thing, and you don't even do it yourself.

Anyway, Ratman, where'd the rest of my post go?  No comments on it?  No 
denials about what I said?  Absolutely nothing to add besides the
below thug-like threat and sneer?  Not even a `I did not'?

Somehow, Ratman, I expected you to behave in this way.  You never were
the type to sit down and discuss an issue rationally, were you?  Nay, 
it's either you're right or everyone else is wrong.  God forbid you
might consider the shades of gray.

>I tell ya, I appreciate you making it easier for me to shut this thing down.
>I felt kinda bad about it, but this helps make me feel better about it. 

Do you enjoy making other people suffer, Ratman?  Apparently, you take
great pleasure in watching those of us who loved this list twist in the
wind while you dangle the sword of Damocles over this forum.  

Needless to say, you've made it far easier for -me- to motivate my
friends to start up a new mailing list.  After all, next to the fear
of death, rage is the second best motivational tool.

>And if this "rat bashing" becomes a trend, I think i'd like to shut it 
>down right now. I'll see how it goes today and tomorrow.

How do you sleep at night, Ratman?  Can you honestly say to me that hurting
so many other people is not a problem for you?  Perhaps that MK crowd
of yours has zeroed your empathy levels...

>But I'd rather give it the full week for people to say their goodbyes, 
>and possibly advertise for other forums people can use to discuss Sonic.

It's too late to apply damage control, Ratman.

>So yes, this is my frigging mailing list dammit, I'm not about to sit by and
>watch people band together to say what a jerk I am. You can't tell me you
>wouldn't do the same thing. 

Actually, I wouldn't be taking away the list in the first place.  I'd
just let it fix itself, eventually.  And if that didn't work, I'd help
to start a thread that would get people's minds back on-topic.

Also, Ratman, I'd sit and take my medicine for my past misdeeds, rather
than editing them all away and trying to shift the blame onto someone
else.  If -I- thought someone had said something bad about me, I'd take
issue with them in a logical, scientific fashion, proving that what the
other person(s) said was incorrect.

In closing, if this be the message that stopped this list prematurely, so 
be it.  It will only make my resolution to win a new list stronger.  I
will not cowtow to you again.

Joe.

I'm going to maintain a web page that will have information about other 
sonic lists. Hopefully this will smooth the transition to any new list.

http://rat.org/sonic/list.html

If anyone wants me to put information about their mailing list, I will 
add it.

I will not give out the subscriber list to anyone, or post to the list of
subscribers advertising for other mailing lists after I shut it down, so 
don't ask.

To quote Cyan Garamonde, from Final Fantasy III: "Simmer down, Sirs."

    Rat, I can't say that I BLAME you for shutting the list down, but you
can't expect to take something away from such die-hard fans and not have
any angry responses.
    You also have to admit that you HAVE had your inadequecies in the past
-- anyone who says they've always been right is an arrogant, lying
Benny-wannabe.  (Sorry.  Inside joke.)  People SHOULD let sleeping dogs
lie, but on the other hand, if they DON'T, you shouldn't respond the same
way.  Though every last one of us owes you thanks, YOU owe each of US an
apology, at LEAST for the closing.
    In any case, I'm trying NOT to take sides, but the more this
progresses, the less oriented I am to defending you.

MilesProw here.

Unfortunately, Jarrett, that will NOT work. Op status is not a toy to be
played around with. I have made that opping policy known to all for one
simple reason: If I play favorites with certain people, everyone will expect
to be opped. If everyone is opped, including those people that I don't even
know, the channel will be taken over, and all of us will be thrown out by
the troublemakers. That is a foregone conclusion. Once this happens, there's
not much that can be done, save a few 'creative' things that I might try. ;)
But most of the time, I am powerless to do anything to help the situation
once we've been thrown out and banned. 

I stand by my decision.

Yes, the government owes us. But I guess you don't pay taxes yet. Would you
like to pay me taxes? If you paid me, and I didn't follow through on the
agreement, then you would have reason to bitch. Otherwise, shut the hell up.
I'm sick of hearing this.

> > It doesn't matter anyway since the list is going away soon.

> You don't seem to care.

It's pointless to try to enforce list policy when there is about to be no
list. And I do care, otherwise I would have just shut the list down without
warning. Ever consider that?

> You always (have had) this chip on your shoulder.  Mind explaining why?

It just upsets me when people forget that this is a free service that I am
providing, and refuse to respect that. People still post binaries and fan
fiction regardless of how much I bitched about it. And I get "how dare that
mean ratman tell me not to do this".

The reaction to me shutting the list down makes me even more bitter. I don't
owe any of you anything. And after seeing some of the flames and personal
attacks against me, I wish I had known about those people so I could have
banned them from the list sooner. As much as people don't like the fact, this
list is on MY server, and if people don't like it, they can get the hell out.
I don't have to explain why, it is my decision. This is not a democracy.  For
example, if EVERYONE wrote me and said they wanted fanfic to be permitted to
be posted, do you think I would allow it? I don't think so. But this is all a
moot point since this list will be no more. 

The upside to this, is nobody HAS TO be here. If everyone hated the way I 
ran things, someone else could make their own mailing list, and everyone 
would join that.

But I'll try not to let the flames get me down, I did see a few nice
thank-you's from people. I do appreciate it.

So to people that said thank you, I say "I appreciate it, and you're
welcome", and I'm sorry to see you go.

And to those freeloading scum, I say, "I wish you had shown your true colors
before so I could have kicked your ungrateful ass off."

Note I have unsubscribed hk512@cleveland.freenet.edu since I don't feel like
reading any other posts by him.

And I'd like to thank Erich, who was the real list admin. I owned the list,
but I asked him to run it, which he did. His job was to be the person behind
owner-sonic@lists.mv.net that people could ask questions to. Also he had the
dredded task of unsubscribing invalid email addresses.

DON'T DO IT MAN!!!!!  You were not looking in the right places,  There is
serveral people on ALT.FAN.SONIC-HEDGEHOG that have written Fan fiction that
are trying to have posted (one series to Bookshire's).  IF you advertise,
they will come.

I myself would like to say that I'm sorry to see this list go.  I really
enjoyed it, and I met some new friends on it to.  I wish everybody well on
whatever their lives and quests take them, and also to invite everybody to my
web site at http://users.aol.com/dgonterman, where I'll keep the story of
Sonic and his Freedom Fighter Friends going.

Thanks, that's a step in the right direction.  If you have to let somebody
down (okay, poor choice of words; this isn't something you HAVE to do, but
if you're GOING to let somebody down), at LEAST give them someone else to
turn to.

I'd like to say that at first I was aghast and utterly dismayed by Ratman's
decision to shut this Sonic mailing list down.  The last few messages seem
to indicate that most of the list members do not agree with him, and would
prefer the list to continue.

Now the initial shock of the annoucement has subsided, it seems clear to me
that the thing to do is to move the list someplace else.  I see that 
"Commander Sonic Data" <soniccsd@inet.uni-c.dk> has already offered to host
a Sonic list.  So, I'd like to offer my site as a new home for the list too.
The address of my Sonic list (including subscription requests) is:

  sonic@sago.cuc.ab.ca

Finally, I would also like to thank Ratman for providing a home for the 
list for the last 16 months.

LETTER TO RATMAN (RAT@RAT.ORG)

Sir.

It has come to my attention that certain persons would like to keep the list
running.  If the idea of Comic and Fanfiction offend you,  one should keep
quiet.  If this was not the original intention of the list to be a area for
television only,  then think of this as a comliment that some people took
the time to write fanfiction Or to comment about the comic books when They
cancelled them.  If this had not happened,  the list would have closed down
when the Series ended.  

I just want to ask you to reconsider what you are doing,  if you take away
the list, You are taking a means of comunication between people.  You are
alone putting your hand across the mouths of everyone on this list.  And
preventing others from finding about the Joys of Sonic The Hedgehog.

We await your decision.


P.S.  If I had access to the hardware, I would take over.
Dennis Hurst (dhurst@appstate.campus.mci.net)

To All:

I really regret this list's going away. So, before, I can never ever ever
post again, I will say my thanks.

To Ratman: Thanks fer havin' the list anyways, mac.

To David Gonterman: Keep up the good work.

To Joseph Delacroix(sp? Too bad he'll never see it.): Nice word gymnastics.

To Ken Penders: Thanks for all the insight.

To everyone in general (even the spammers, you know who you are): It was
fun while it lasted. Too bad I didn't discover the list in time (Only got 2
months of list time in).

To Dan Drazen: I hope to see more of your stories at Bookshires.


Again, I really despise the fact that this list is going (it keeps my
mailbox full :) ;) ). No hard feeling, 'kay???

I think I know what you meant, regardless of how it came out. Regardless of
what people think of me, I do want to make it easy for someone else to pick
this up. 

I just won't let anyone else have access to the subscriber list since it
would be done without each and every member's consent, and I'd rather that
they are given the choice of being a part of a new list instead of just
copied to a new list. There I got with my personal moral standards again, but
I'm not going to bend on this one.

that you would do away with those people who speak their minds and tell you
your faults, when you should actually be REMEMBERING what you've done wrong
so that you can be a better person in the future.

That's ODD, I seem to recall your VERY EXCUSE for not allowing fanfic was
that SOME PEOPLE were inconvenienced by large posts.  So you're saying that
was a LIE????!!!!!!  Or, possibly not a LIE, but not the FOREMOST reason,
EITHER.  I feel betrayed to NO END.

>And to those freeloading scum, I say, "I wish you had shown your true

Well, I'm GLAD that YOU didn't show YOUR true colors before, because, had
you done so, I'd've quit this list a year ago and wouldn't be who I am today.

Go ahead and unsubscribe me if you wish, but I BEG you to at LEAST remember
this post and those that Joe wrote, because I hope OTHERS don't have to put
up with this side of you.  You've been generous to us all, Rat, and have
given us a haven...all you've done has been what you thought to be in
people's best interests, with a few exceptions.  I want people to remember
THAT side of you, the side Matt Penna knows, not the side Joe DeLaCroix
knows...I'm trying REAL HARD to remember you as Matt does, but I keep
finding myself agreeing with Joe...

heh. didn't expect you to call my bluff. But I think you missed my point. I
am doing this for free, so that I don't have to commit to any of this. Also
this kind of thing really should be for free, but the people that spend the
money to host it should get a little respect. And if they decide they want
out, they should be allowed to leave. 

And some other people have said they would be starting lists, so just hop
onto one of those. And just think, you wouldn't have to put up with tyranny
of the horrible rat! 
Sorry, I'm so pissed off right now, I think I'll wait another day before
posting anymore. I'm only making things worse by trying to defend myself. 

And please, all of you, stop asking me to reconsider. I've announced that I
will shut down the list, and I try not to make a habit out of saying I will
do things, then not do them. And after all the hate mail I have gotten, I
don't think there's any possible way in hell I will set myself up for that
abuse again.

I'm sick of the all-out rat bashing that has taken over this list. I had
hoped that the flames I had gotten would be met with people defending me, but
I seem to have more enemies than I had ever imagined.

I have turned this list into a "moderated" one, so only posts I approve will
get though. So say what a jerk I am all you want, nobody will see it but me. 
We already know what a jerk I am, so there's no need for the whole list to
see it. 


The only thing I will approve is:

1. goodbye, it's been fun posts
2. advertisements for other mailing lists
3. anything else I'm not thinking of that is on topic and very important.

Subject: List Server FOUND!

[X] Possible Bounce Detection

Greetings,

With regards to what will be the eventual termination of this list:
 I have spoken to a friend who owns and a Unix server of which he runs one
of the greatest and most FREE MUCKS (SPR), and  <DRUM ROLL> he said he would
be happy to provide the list for us!
        No, I'm not joking.. he REALLY said that he would be happy to
provide the list, and asked whether I knew anything about Majordomo. (which
I don't - So I'll have to either learn fast or find someone who knows how
already) 

It seems that Rat is fixed on not giving out the listing, for certain moral
reasons, so everyone will have to resubscribe as soon as this new list does
come up.

      ALSO

I understand some people want to run the list from their email account.. but
let me explain something to them quicky:
        100 users.. X 15 posts a day =  1500 messages a day X3K each = 4.5MB 
(I doubt you'll be able to send all that!) 

A list server will of course not have this problem! :) 
Hang on.. I'll be sorting the rest of this business out tonight (SA time) 

And be excellent my cool friends!

BTW: For those of you who know the sysop of SPR.. don't bother his about
this.. not yet at least.. okay? He may have agreed, but sending him
moron-mail right now would probably not be to our advantage.


Cheers

Subject: Thanks you's to many people

Hello, everybody. Since the list will be closing in a few short days, I'd
like to thank certain people who have really made a lasting impact on my
appreciation of Sonic. I'm taking advantage of this opportunity now, before
I allow it to slip through my fingers forever. (Listed in no particular order.) 


To John Johnston:
The Sonic Code is cool! Need I say more? ;)


To Ron Bauerle:
Thanks for making copies of the saturday morning shows for me! I'm not an
early riser, so USA is OUT... ;)


To Thad Boyd:
Need I explain? Without you, I never would have gotten into Sonic at all,
and wouldn't have been a part of this list. I'm really glad that I got to
know you. It's been about 5 years, hasn't it? (Ah, the days when 2400 baud
was state of the art...) 


To Joe Delacroix:
Thanks for introducing me to Sociopolitical Ramifications! Lots of fun, lots
of new people. (Keep writing those fan-fics!)


To Ken Penders:
Glad to have you on the list, Ken! Your insight and explanations of why
things are the way they are has been most valuable. It's helped my
understanding of the comic book industry, as well as my appreciation for the
Sonic books in general. 


To Dan Drazen:
I've always enjoyed your fan-fic, and have looked forward to seeing the "For
FAQ file (Spoilers)" subject line on a monthly basis. :)


To Eric Goodwin: 
Looking forward to a sequel!


To David Pistone, and all other fan-fic authors:
Thank you, all of you. You've provided me with HOURS of enjoyment. Keep it up!


The following people are all contributors to the Sonic IRC sessions in one
form or another, among other things.

To Commander Sonic Data:
Thanks very much for all of your offers of assistance! 

To Dennis Hurst:
Thanks again for the server listing!

To Doug LoConti:
Thanks for helping to set up a new bot to make all of our lives easier on
EFNet! You do good work as an op, as well. (Especially when troublemakers
have access to 4 different Internet accounts...) :)

To Jason Shank and Chris Flinn:
Thanks for helping me run #sonic! It would be a major headache without you.

To everyone who visits #sonic:
Thank you! Bring friends! 


And, finally, a BIG thanks to Ratman.
For hosting the list, for hosting the IRC bot, for hosting the IRC pages,
for having such a cool file archive, and other things.



In case I don't have the opportunity to talk to all of you in the future,
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES! I'm glad to have been a part of the list, and I'm
very glad to have gotten to know all of you.


Bidding a very fond farewell to all...

Subject: I've returned ...

... to what?!

When it rains, it pours.  First, I am forced to move to a new apartment 
with little notice.  Then my computer is damaged in the move and I had to 
get a new motherboard.  Then my video card's ROM chip is found to be 
dead, so it's new video card time.  All shipped expensively overnight.  
And now that I've rejoined the net, I come home to 700 waiting messages 
and the shock of discovering that the list is being dissolved.  After 
informing Ratman by voice of my equipment problems, the last thing I 
expected was to come back to nothing.

You are not going to see me very much in the a.f.s-h newsgroup.  This is 
because posts from pine on this provider rarely get out, and my US 
Internet either doesn't know how to fix nn (it's been broken 11 months) 
or they refuse to.  As for #sonic, IRC has proven to be more grief than I 
can deal with so I'm deleting mIRC and giving up.  I will probably ask 
Alexei on FurToonia if I can have a second character in case anyone wants 
to correspond with me that way; very few people know who my present FT 
character is and I intend to keep it that way.  I will keep my 
acme@use.usit.net address until and if a better ISP that offers shell 
access opens in my community.

Though I cannot achieve the level of automation possible with majordomo, 
it is possible for me to run a replacement list on this account.  I have 
enough knowledge of pine and shell scripts to make this reasonably 
practical.  I also have a friend on FurToonia whose provider offers 
mailing lists; I don't know what their fees are.  Some long-time members 
of this list may recall that my original intention was to run this list 
off my Delphi account, with the aid of software I would write myself.  I 
am no longer on Delphi, but I still can write software, and writing shell 
scripts to use with pine is a better solution than trying to write a 
dedicated mailing list manager for my own PC.

I can port the Merchandise List to my personal Webspace without much 
difficulty, but there is no possibility I can offer even 10% of all the 
files now stored on rat.org in this way.  At least I had downloaded a lot 
of them while I had the chance.  I've also maintained my own list 
archives since Day 1.

Over its 16 month life, I've seen this list through good times and bad:  
from the hard work and dedication of our faq-dd keeper (Dan Drazen) to 
the ill-will of a bitter netizen who never did subscribe (name 
intentionally omitted), from Archie Comics and Sega establishing their 
presence on the list to dealing with 2 mailbombing threats :(, and from 
our first story posting and the spawning of Bookshire's page to dealing 
with our first and only net.spam attack.

And to Ratman, I owe a great debt of gratitude, and not just for no-cost 
use of the majordomo server, a shell account, and ftp site, but also for 
those things you can't place price tags on:  experience in people 
administration and management, a taste of the day to day grit you deal 
with on the "supply" side of an information system, a reason to read RFC 
821 (g), and a small yet permanent part of Internet history.  I even owe 
the creation of my FurToonia character to the encouragement of one-time 
list member Craig Moore and list member Alessandro Sanasi.

I don't know how many tens of on and offline hours I have put into this list 
since its planning stages in January 1995.  Losing this will be more 
burden than relief, for I have lost not just a job but a part of myself --
the part fueling 1.5 lines of my .signature.  I am deeply disappointed 
this is all coming to an end so soon and so suddenly -- and that I had to 
find out the way that I did.

Though we didn't always see eye-to-eye on administrative and technical 
issues (and certainly not on operating systems (g)), Ratman is a fine man 
to work for, and I knew I could always count on him to help whenever I 
was in over my head.  It is absolutely no understatement or exaggeration 
that he has helped me more for free than US Internet's help desk has for 
fee.  Though I may be several years his senior (and maybe the #2 or #3 
oldest on the list), his knowledge and experience outpace mine by such 
leaps and bounds I am left not worthy to touch his floppy disks.  Without 
reservation, I wish Ratman and Scratchwood all the best personally and 
professionally as we go our seperate ways.

Finally, to all present and former subscribers, thank you for helping 
make the Sonic list a success.  We certainly could not have been the 
group we were without you.

Last announcement to this list, I imagine.

Anyway, I got two new stories from Joseph DeLaCroix now posted to the 
page so drop by and check him out.  And be sure to tell him what you 
think of them, because it's the praise of his fans that keeps him writing 
and making the stories everything you want them to be.

I was contemplating writing software to help me run this list off my
Delphi account.  I can hardly imagine having run the list like that over
the past few months had Ratman never offered use of his server.  But now,
instead, I have 15 months of experience using majordomo; 'nuff said.

That equation only holds true if you have 100 subscribers and each posted 
15 messages a day.  As you said, that's 1500 posts a day.  Fortunately, 
the Sonic list was never that busy.  I don't know of any list that is.

With pine and shell scripts, it would not be too burdensome for me to run 
the list off my shell account.  And I'm used to expending the daily time 
required to do it, and I'm used to handling the daily dose of bounces.

That's true, though majordomo can become troublesome when you get past 
500 or so users on a list.  But let's leave that for the majordomo-users 
mailing list.

Seeing how this poster has publically dragged me through the mud (again), my 
response is necessitated.  As Ratman has written his own responses, I am 
not responding to points not aimed against me unless I am asked by him to 
do otherwise.

It was not my decision to disallow posting of stories.

Last summer, Ratman firmly decided against posting binary files.  I had 
no problem with this and implemented the policy accordingly right away.  
My interpretation of "no binaries" was that story postings would be 
allowed as they were text postings whereas a .JPG or .GIF is 
unquestionably binary.  November 1995 is when Ratman expanded the policy 
to disallow posting of stories.  I did argue my interpretation to him in 
direct mail, but as this is his server, I ultimately had to implement his 
wishes promptly.

I saw you say on Sociopolitical Ramifications that I posted my 
administrative message to you to the list.  This is absolutely false.  I 
immediately double-checked my message and confirmed that it was sent to 
you directly.  You didn't know I was in the same room because I was 
Guest1 at that time.

You never saw my discussions of this issue with Ratman because it was in 
private mail with him.  Did you ever try to correspond with me in private 
mail?  No; not one message.  I keep everything in my sent-mail folder for 
3 weeks so I could have forwarded these messages to you upon request, and 
you could have authenticated them with Ratman.

But instead of using e-mail, you chose to make threats against me on 
FurToonia.  Very few people know who my FT character is, so I bet you 
never knew I was in the same room with you.  Ever since then, I knew I 
made the right decision to abandon my former character Toby in late 
October 1995 and be secretive about my character.

The decision was made before you posted your story, and was temporarily 
mired in differences in interpretation not resolved until just prior to 
your posting.  Call it bad luck, call it bad timing, but do not call it a 
conspiracy against you.  Had you asked me or Ratman about it in a 
civilized private message, you would have known that over 6 months ago.

As for not commenting on your story, I did not do so because I sent my
non-public message to you before reading it.  My modus operandi has always
been to tend to administrative needs first, and then respond to posts and
write new ones.  I would read short posts online, and save the long posts
for reading offline.  Though I do have SLIP and PPP accounts, I still
prefer to handle my mail with my shell account.  I could not possibly have
offered you an opinion of your story at that point in time because, again,
I had not yet read it.  Had you asked me about it in a civilized private
message, you would have known that over 6 months ago.

I very seldom posted administrative warnings to the list.  I feel there 
is no need to embarrass someone with a public scolding and no one else on 
the list wants to read such a thing anyway.  I have posted warnings when 
the situation warranted, but the list archives prove that was 
infrequent.  I did send warnings just like the one you got to other list 
subscribers, but you didn't see them because I sent them in private 
mail.  Had you asked me or Ratman about it in a civilized private 
message, you would have known that over 6 months ago.

I don't recall what Ratman posted that allegedly applauded others' story 
postings, but I never did any such thing.  The list archives prove it.

I have nothing to do with it. But I did make a web page to help people 
find new lists after they get set up.
I've heard several people say already that they are going to setup new 
lists, but so far have not seen a single person say they have a working 
list right now.
If I am wrong, someone please correct me.

I wasn't going to forward this since it makes people want to reply to it, but
what the hell, it's a "goodbye" message. And it's someone that's actually
defending me, and these are so rare, I may as well let these get posted. 

Rememeber, don't bother posting a reply since I probably won't forward it 
to the list. Only goodbyes and advertisements for new lists.

Somehow, I can't agree on much of what Joe's saying.  Am I the only one or
do I just see Joe goin' off the handle kinda unreasonably?  I mean... this
IS Rat's machine...it's not as though this is IT--NO WAY you can live
without this service or somethin'.  If tomorrow you should lose ALL the TV
station in your local area, you're NOT exactly going to complain since
there's cable TV, satalite, etc...  um.. way I see it, just because Rat
feels like dropping this list doesn't mean you can't go IRC, start your OWN
list, go to the newsgroup, etc..etc.  Complaining about Rat doin' this is
like complaining about the rights you have to have privileges.  It don't
make sense to me.

If your message stopped the list prematurely, you certainly wouldn't be any
better than the kinda person you're complaining about to begin with.  I
don't see it your way--sorry. :P


THANK RATMAN, for the list... and in some ways, thanks for tearing it down. :P
heh

Kiken here, supporter of the first Japanese Sonic homepage, am giving 
this list its final post to say my 'Sayounara's' and such. ;)

To Ken:
  Even though the only comics I read are in Japanese, it was nice to see 
that one of my favourite characters of all time was being respectfully 
portrayed through your comic.  Dou mo arigatou.

To Dan:
  For all the spoilers that gave me a chance to see what Ken was writing. ;)

To Joe:
  For his insight, despite the fact that his opinions were very brash.

To Matt:
  For maintaining the Sonic IRC channel.  I know I haven't been there in 
a while, but I should resurface by this weekend.  BTW, I have a tape with 
6 hours of Jungle Emperor ready for you, pray that the post offices here 
finally get in some videotape mailing boxes.

To Rat:
  For giving us this list to spark debate and discussion on the world of 
Mobius.  I hope you are enjoying the recording of Mega Sonic CD that I sent.
Dou mo arigatou gozaimashita.

To Sonic 4:
  Someone I haven't spoken to in a LONG time.  I hope you also enjoy the 
copy of Mega CD Sonic that I sent you.  Keep that artwork coming.

Now for something completely different:
  I had wished to make this upon the arrival of the tapes at my house, 
but seeing as the list is going down, I'm making the posting early, to 
all those interested in obtaining a copy of the Sonic The Hedgehog Anime 
(from Japan), please contact me personally, I will then return your 
E-mail messages with the appropriate info when I recieve the tapes.

Special goodbyes to:
Dan Ramos (the one up above was Dan Drazen)
Ablater
Mighty
Jaybird
Fangaroo (how was Duckon?)
and to all the others that I had interaction with.

Well, following Matt's cue, I think I'm going to HAVE to thank everyone
who's made my participation in this wonderful world worth my time.  So,
here they are, in no particular order:

Dan Drazen: You're the best author ever to grace Sonicdom.  Keep 'em
comin'!  I look forward (well, actually BACKWARD, as my issues come fairly
late) to your monthly critiques of the Archie comic.

Ken Penders: Thanks for your thoughtful comments on our comic discussions,
and also for keeping me from cancelling my subscription with your art and
co-authorship on the monthly Knuckles mini-series preludes.

Eric Goodwin: Your contribution to Sonic '94-'96 was quite appreciated.
Thanks for the utmost flattery in asking for my opinions while you worked
on Sir Kain's Story.  Plus (no pun intended), you were the ONLY ONE who
listened to me when I said to get the BBNM; thus YOUR Prodigy account,
unlike the others', was terminated by choice, not due to fees.

Simon Howes: You made me re-examine my approach to stories (well...okay, so
you sorta just made me MAD, but I felt like saying that anyway).  Besides
that, it was VERY generous of you to let ME be the one to save Mobius in
Mobian GPF.  (BTW...How DID you know so much about me in that story?!  You
had my brother's character PERFECT, and it SEEMS like you knew that Dave
lives relatively close to me, so I WOULD be the most logical choice to send
the frozen Jell-O cube to...)

Dave Pistone: Thanks for providing a haven for everybody's fanfic.  Of all
the WWW pages I've seen, yours is by far my favorite.  Also, thanks for not
complaining when I took your character and wrote an origin story for him
that was somewhat contradictory to what you'd set down <glares at Brent
Roberts>...finally, thanks for correcting the minor errors you made in your
presentation of The Hunt Begins.  When Prodigy gets Telnet (they're working
on it as I type this), I'll be sure to check out your BBS...I wish I could
go there with just a normal comm prog, but oh well...

Doug LoConti: Thanks for bein' such a help in Mettle...sorry I haven't
really helped, despite being on the team.  BTW, *I* was going to create a
character profiles page, but you beat me to it...great minds think alike.  8)

Matt Penna: Thanks for almost seven years (well, I guess about five, as you
said, when you take away the two I was gone) of friendship.  When Prod gets
IRC, I'll see you there.  8)  Keep in touch, ol' buddy.

Brent Roberts: Thank you SO much for not being on the list!!!

Erich: Thanks for puttin' up with the lot of us.

Ratman: You gave us this virtual community...thank you from the bottom of
my heart.

Lindsay Cibos: You're not a subscriber anymore, but you STILL deserve to be
recognized by everyone who IS.  You introduced me to this whole thing, and
you were ALSO the first to join me as a Chrono Trigger fanatic...<VBG>

Everyone who's written fanfic: You've given me hours of enjoyment, and also
insight to my own stories.

Anyone I haven't mentioned: You've all contributed to making this a
wonderful environment...thanks SO much.





Thank you all.  It's been real!

If there is user interest, I can run a replacement list on my shell 
account.  Just say the word and I can have things ready in 1 day.  Anyone 
who is interested should send mail to me directly.

I cannot leave background processes running while logged off, so mail 
will only be processed while I am online.  I am normally online 1-3 times 
a day so this will not be a major problem.  I will be able to improve 
automation over time, but it will always be limited by my presence online.

I may be able to offer a digest (not mh-compatible).  This may, in fact, 
be easier for me to set up.  I may be able to offer previous-month 
archives, but no more than that.  I will be able to keep the subscriber 
list nonviewable to the public.

I will continue this list's no-binary policy.  I am willing to allow 
posting of stories, subject to a daily size limit (tentatively 50K).  
This list's on/off-topic scope will be continued.

Subscribe and unsubscribe requests will be implemented in a way totally 
dissimilar to majordomo's method, but no more difficult for the user to 
employ.  They can only be processed while I am online, so there will be 
delays in effecting requests.  I am normally online 1-3 times a day so 
this will not be a major problem.

Yeah, I know it's early, but so what.

This is the last post anyone will see to this list.

It's been fun, but everything must come to an end. And the closing of this
list has been a learning experience for me to say the least. When I
eventually close the other mailing lists here, I will have to remember what
happened here and simply close it without warning.

And remember guys, it's not the end of the world. It's just a stupid mailing
list. If the closing of this list has ruined your life, you probably didn't
have one to begin with.

And remember to check http://rat.org/sonic/list.html for updates on new sonic
mailing lists as people send info to me.
