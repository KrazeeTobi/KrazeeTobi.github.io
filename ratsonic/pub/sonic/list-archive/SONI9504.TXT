Archives of the Sonic mailing list for February and March are now
available for ftp.  The filenames are soni0295.zip and soni0395.zip,
and can be found on ftp.mv.com at /pub/users/rat/sonic/message-archive.
Don't forget to use Binary or Image transfer mode.  Each .zip is
about 450K and expands to about 1100K.

Archives of the current month (April) can, as always, be retrieved
through the mailing list software.  See the Sonic "How-To" file for
instructions.

If you use a Unix system, you can load all of the archive files as a
mailbox folder for convenient browsing with pine or elm.

HOW TO GET A LIST OF FILES YOU CAN RETRIEVE
-------------------------------------------
Send this text in your message:  index sonic


HOW TO GET A RETRIEVABLE FILE
-----------------------------
Send this text in your message:  get sonic filename.txt
(Change filename.txt to the
correct name of the file you
want sent to you.)


HOW TO REVIEW THE WELCOME / INTRODUCTORY TEXT

We are doing three things in this message.  First, we are asking for a list
of commands.  The list software offers more commands than there are listed
here.  Next, we're asking for two files, one is file1.txt and the other is
file2.txt.  Finally, we are asking for a list of files we can get, just in
case there might be more files that would interest us.  The "end" command
on the following command tells the list software not to expect any more
commands in this message.  The list software will send a reply with the
information we requested.

If you are planning on downloading those message archive zips, this is 
important, otherwise you don't have to read..

I tested them by downloading, and realized they were UNIX textfiles. I
translated them, and rezipped them (they were zipped with the old zip) and
now they are about 350K zipped.

I have some good news for Eudora users. You can load any mail file as a
mailbox for easy viewing. I tried this with the sonic mail file, and it works
just great. Write me if anyone wants to know how.

Greetings all!

The following changes to my FTP and WWW sites will be effective as of 6pm 
MST on Tuesday, April 4, 1995:

FTP changes:

My FTP site will NO LONGER be a place to download ANY material.  From 
this point forward it is being maintained as a directory where people can 
go to get specific files that they have requested from me through private 
E-mail.  This will be it's ONLY function.

WWW changes:

Dan Drazen's epic, 12-part Sonic adventure, "Bloodlines" will be made 
available on my stories page as of the above time and date.

The highly controversial "cc-" Sonic pics will also be made available.  
Due to various factors, however, they will not be visibly listed on my 
pages.  To access them, add the filename, "cc.html" at the end of my WWW 
site address.

Also, a limited number of screen shots from the SatAM TV series will also 
be posted.  A public thanx to Craig Moore for providing me with these 
pictures.

The above changes will be slowly taking place over the next 24 hours and 
will be finished by the above time.

Hi guys!

I spent all last weekend redesigning my web page, making icons,
and nearly pulling my hair out.  But it's there, and has much more
than it did last week.  Check it out!

In relation to my personal web page, I'm looking for others who have
personal pages dedicated to Sonic Hedgehog (besides Rotor and
Ratman, I have them already).  Please e-mail me the URL if you want
to have some more public exposure for the blue high-velocity Freedom
Fighter.  I'm also looking for some Freedom Fighter pictures that I might
be able to use in my web page.

Above all, tell me what you think of my contribution to our blue friend!

I have an ftp directory dedicated to sonic. No web page. I have a web 
page, but no sonic on it.

    I'm a bit uncertain.  I getmy Email on -- get this-- a dial-in to a
Wildcat bbs that can access the internet.  Now, when I see an
interesting mail message come across on the newsgroup, I'm not certain
if I can reply directly-- since the messages all come from other sites
than sard.mv.net.  Anyone know if I have to forward any replies, or can
I just reply to the message, expecting it to get to sard?

    OOT:  I finally gotm STH:The Comic #s 21-23, and PS is easily one of
the best artists that they've gotten so far.  I'm just waiting for his
rendition of Bunnie.  THAT's worth waiting for...

   Williams was sitting in his chair, looking through some files when his
train of thought was broken by his computer.
   "Incoming visual transmission," it reported.
   Why would anybody contact him?  The only person who knows he's here is
Sonic, but why now?  The only other person who could contact him was...Adam!
"Computer, answer it!"  A hologram of a very familiar numbat appeared before
him.  "Adam!"
   "It seems you ARE alive," noticed Adam.
   "What happened?  Why didn't you contact me before?"
   "It's a long story.  Why didn't YOU contact me?"
   "I tried.  You never answered.  I assumed you were roboticized but
couldn't find you.  That left but one alternative: death."
   "Well, I kinda had my computer 'confiscated.'  But, obviously, I got it
back.  You have NO idea what we went through to get out of this mess."
   "WE?  You mean--"  A familiar paca stepped into the display.  "Kristen!"
   "I'm so happy to finally see you again!" she exclaimed.
   "Are you okay?"
   "Fine now.  At one point I fell out of air duct.  I don't remember
exactly what happened, but Adam says I broke my leg."
   "You should've seen it!"  Adam tried to describe the situation.  "Thirty
or forty foot drop, knocked unconscious, leg broken right in half, blood
everywhere.  We were being chased so I--"
   "Chased?"  Williams thought that to be strange.  "By who?  I though
Robotnik was gone."
   "Apparently some Swat-bots are still here.  Anyway, we were being chased
so I had to climb down and get her out of there.  By the time I got there,
the bleeding stopped.  I picked her up and brought her to the safest place I
could find.  I just stuck the leg back in place and within two hours the
entire thing was healed!  Not even a scar!"
   "I'm sure you have many more stories that can wait.  Where are you?"
   "We've set up camp outside of Robotropolis, or what's left."
   "I'll be right there.  Just send me the--"
   "No, we'll meet you in Wespero.  It'll be good to be back home."
   "Okay, but hurry."  The transmission was discontinued.  Williams
continued his work as he waited.

   The door burst open and Kristen came running in.  Williams barely had
enough time to get out of his chair before she pounced on him.  They fell
to the ground and Williams got a minor bump on his head, but he couldn't
feel it--he was too busy being kissed by Kristen.
   "I'm so glad to see you!" she finally stopped and got up.
   "I can tell," noticed Williams.
   Adam helped him up and they hugged each other as tight as ever.  He
patted Williams on the back.  "You're alive."
   Williams sat back down.  "Yes, we've established that."
   "After Robotnik singled you out, I though that was the end of you."
   "Nah, he just wanted to interrogate me.  Nothing I couldn't handle.
What's your story?"
   "The rest of us were either executed or roboticized, depending on how
well we behaved.
   "They shot my mother," Kristen told him.  "Right there, right in front of
me.  They just shot her."
   Williams knew what this meant.  "Kristen?  You okay?"
   "No!" She broke into tears.  "They shot her!"  She needed a shoulder to
cry on and Williams was there for her.
   "What happened?"
   "A Swat-bot ordered her to cooperate, but she didn't."  Adam explained it
for Kristen.  "She fought it, but lost."
   Williams started to laugh.  He was the only one laughing.  "I can't
imagine Helen going up against a Swat-bot!"
   Kristen always wondered how he could just shake these things off.
   "C'mon, Kristen."  Williams tried to remedy the situation.  "Best friends
are reunited after each one thought the other was dead.  We're supposed to
laugh at each other's anecdotes, not dwell on the morbid aspects of our
adventures.  Don't you see?  WE are what's left of this village, WE
survived, WE won.  Don't you feel...special?"
   It took a while, but she eventually calmed down.  "I guess you're right.
You know, one time--"
   "I'm sure it's a great story, but there's no time.  We're off to the
Great Unknown."  Williams began to pack up his things.
   "But we just got here," complained Adam.
   Williams ignored him.  "I've found a way to open the void.  We're going
to test my theory."
   "Why in the Great Unknown?"
   "In case anything goes wrong, nothing important will be sucked in."
   "You're always so optimistic."
   "You coming?"  Williams directed his question to Kristen who was sitting
on his bed.
   "No, I--" she sniffled, "I'll stay here."

   "So," inquired Adam, "what now?"  They were in the middle of nowhere.
   "Computer," ordered Williams, "open 'the void' about four hundred feet in
front of me."  It took a while, but soon a bright yellow and purple helix
appeared in front of him.  "You want to go in first?" he gave Adam the
honor.
   "That's okay.  You opened it, you go in."
   "I think I'll send some nanites in first."  Before he could instruct his
computer to do anything, a scaly, six legged, thirty foot tall, six inch
teeth, razor sharp clawed, insect-like animal came out of the void first.
   "Well, now you've done it."
   "Maybe it's friendly."  Williams started to walk toward it.
   It noticed the two appetizers and let out a roar in their direction.
   "Or not.  Computer, close 'the void.'"  It did.  "Hellooooo!" he called.
   It roared back.
   "Doesn't seem to be all that intelligent," noticed Adam.
   "Computer," ordered Williams, "send out some nanites to stun
the...uh...the creature and give me a progress report."
   "Nanites released," reported his computer.  About a minute later,
"Nanites have infected host."  A few seconds later, "Nanites have been
destroyed."
   It started to walk toward them.
   "Adam, I suggest we make a strategic retreat to Wespero."  They both took
off running.
   The creature chased after them.  Although it could run fast (compared to
most Mobian animals), it got tired quickly.  There was too little carbon
dioxide in the air.

   "You're never going to believe what happened," Williams said as he sat
down on his bed.  "A, uh, creature came through the void."
   "A 'creature?'"  Kristen looked to Adam for some sort of confirmation.
   "Don't look at me.  I'm not the one who conjured it up."
   "What does it look like?"
   "Well, I'd say it's a cross between a dragon and an ant."
   "I think it was hungry," added Williams, "it started to chase us.  I
tried to stun it with some nanites, but they were all destroyed before they
could do anything.  It must have a super immune system."
   "Where is it now?" asked Kristen.
   "Good question.  Computer, where is the creature?"
   "Near the Great Forest."
   "Probably found something to eat," said Kristen.
   "Considering the size of its teeth, I think it's carnivorous," stated
Williams.
   "Could be omnivorous," contributed Adam.
   "Whatever the case, it's not supposed to be here.  We need to find a way
to send it back or kill it."
   "It's not a computer, you can't control it.  Nanites are useless, you
can't kill it.  This isn't going to be easy."
   "Then we get some help."

   Tails was on lookout, sweeping the horizon with his binoculars.  He
stopped and backed up, something caught his eye.  It was far, far away.
He switched to a higher magnification to take a closer look.  There was a
big rock sitting at the edge of the forest.  It was strange to see a rock
that was never there before, but even more strange to see it move.  His eyes
were not deceiving him--the rock moved.  From past experience, he knew that
rocks did not move on their own.  He kept observing it.  A head popped up.
   "Sooooonic!  SOOOOONIC!!!"
   Sonic came racing up to meet him.  "What is it, big guy?"
   Tails handed him the binoculars and pointed in the rock's general
direction.
   Sonic saw what Tails had seen.  "What's THAT?"
   "Keep watching."
   Sonic observed the rock a bit more and saw the head pop up for a moment,
then back down.  "I'm gonna check it out."  And he did.  In under ten
seconds, he was standing in front of the rock.  "Mondo weird."
   The creature heard him coming and turned to look at the tiny, blue
animal.  Its target was in range and it spit at him.  Direct hit.
   "Hey!"  Sonic was covered in a cloudy, sticky substance.
   The creature, however, was confused.  Usually when it hits another
animal, the animal gets stunned instantly, ready to eat.  It roared at him.
Sonic could see a vast array of sharp teeth.  For a moment, he stood
motionless.  The creature snapped at him.  Sonic jumped out of the way and
left for Knothole.  He had seen enough.
   "Sal!"  He ran up in front of her.  "Sal, there's something--"
   "A monster in the forest?  Tails already told me."
   "It spit on me!"  He wiped some off.  "What is this stuff, anyway?"
   Sally reached down and detached Nicole from her boot.  "Nicole," Sally
flipped her open, "what is the substance that Sonic is covered in?"
   "Sugar saturated water."
   "What kind of an animal is this?"
   "A big one," replied Sonic.
   "I'd like to go see it."
   "Are you crazy!?!  That thing's dangerous!"
   "Sonic, it spits sugar.  How dangerous can it be?"
   Sonic shook himself off and took Sally to see the creature.

   She found out just how dangerous it could be when she was standing in
front of it.  She saw for herself how big its teeth and claws were. "Nicole,
full scan on the creature."
   "Scanning..."
   "Keep it busy until Nicole's done," she told Sonic.
   Sonic ran around to the creature's head.  It spat at him.  He ran
underneath it to its tail.  It slashed at him with one of its feet.  He ran
around to its side.  It turned to face him and snapped at him.  Again he
ran to one side.  This time the creature, realizing what was going on,
whacked Sally against a tree with its tail.
   The blow from the tail broke a couple of ribs and punctured a lung in the
process.  The tree gave her a nice-sized concussion, shattered a shoulder
blade, and fractured a vertebra or two.  Sonic immediately ran over,
gathered up Sally and Nicole (which just made things worse for Sally, but
was better than being eaten), and took off for Knothole.

   Sonic put Sally down on her bed and went to get Bookshire.  He was in his
hut.  "Bookshire!  Sally's hurt!"
   The tone of Sonic's voice was the most obvious signal that something was
very wrong.  The blood on him was a close second.  He barely had enough time
to grab his first aid kit before Sonic grabbed him and took him back to
Sally's hut.
   "Oh, boy."  This was a much bigger problem than Sonic led him to believe.
He panicked, slightly, but remembered to stay calm.  "There's a, uh, box of
stuff on the table in the, um, far corner of my hut."
   Sonic was gone and in a few seconds came back with the box.  Bookshire
took it from him and put it down next to the bed.
   "Get someone to guard the door," ordered Bookshire as he removed certain
items from his first aid kit and his box.  "No one disturbs us until I say
so."
   Sonic was gone again.  It took him a little longer this time, but only
because he had to explain to Rotor, the closest person, what was going on.
Sonic came back in and closed the door behind him.  He and Bookshire worked
as fast as they could to keep Sally alive.

   Williams and company were now in the Great Forest, on their way to
Knothole Village.
   "What's so special about this village?"
   He remembered what happened the last time he was there, "I have...friends
there.  They might be able to help."
   As they were walking, Sandra stepped out of nowhere and blocked their
path.
   "You again," greeted Williams.  "Who wants me now?"
   "No one.  I need your help.  I take it you've noticed the creature?"
   "Yeah," answered Kristen.  "Who is this?"  She sounded jealous.
   "We are...old acquaintances."
   "Oh, we're more than acquaintances."  Williams smiled at her.
   She grabbed him by the neck and held him up to her face, "Will you help
me?"
   "I'm already on my way to Knothole to find some help of my own."  It was
hard to talk, his voice was scratchy.  "You're welcome to tag along."
   Normally, Sandra would not "tag along" with anybody, but this was
different.  She dropped him on the ground, "Lead the way."

   Tails had resumed his scan of the horizon before Sonic and Sally left to
see the creature and was oblivious to the whole "Sally" incident.  He was,
however, the only one who could see Williams and his band of adventurers
coming towards Knothole.  He decided to meet them and escort them the rest
of the way.

   "Williams!" called Tails.  He landed in front of them.
   "Hey!  Look who it is!" replied Williams.
   "A kid?" asked Adam.
   "Don't underestimate him.  He just might be able to beat you in a
net-war."
   "What!?!  No way!"
   "If I remember correctly, Packbell once referred to him as the 'Supreme
Emperor of All Time and Space.'  After we take care of this creature, we
might have a chance to find out who's better."  Turning to Tails, "Anyway,
where's the princess?"
   "YOU know the princess?" asked Kristen.
   "Yeah, but she hates me."  Back to Tails, "So where is she?"
   "Follow me."  He led the group the final distance to Knothole.

   They were approaching Sally's hut when Rotor noticed them.  He remembered
Sandra and Williams from before, but didn't recognize the other two.
"What's going on, Tails?"
   "We're VIPs from Wespero and are here to see the princess on an important
matter of global safety," explained Williams.
   "SHE is not a VIP," he directed his statement to Sandra.
   "No, she's just somebody we met on the way here.  We need to see the
princess."
   "Sonic said not to let anybody in."
   "Why not?"
   "Sally's been hurt, badly."
   "Is that all?  Sandra, move him."
   She did not.  "I don't take orders from you."
   Williams groaned.  "Sandra, I am kindly asking you, not ordering you, to
help me out."
   She complied.
   "Thank you."  He opened the door and everybody came in.
   "You."  Sonic also recognized the two.  "And her.  Why are you here?  So
you can finish Sally off?"
   "Hardly."  Williams didn't take it personally, he liked having a
reputation.  "I came about the creature, but I guess I have time to save her
life."
   "Save her life?  How can you--"
   "She'll be better than ever in under four hours."
   "That's impossible!"
   "Sonic," Tails backed Williams up, "he saved my life.  Let him help
Sally."  Sonic thought about it for a second.  He didn't know what to do.
   "Let him try," encouraged Bookshire.
   Although his gut feeling told him that Williams could not be trusted,
Sonic stepped out of the way.
   "Computer," said Williams, "send a thousand of my nanites to Princess
Sally."  He walked over to a corner of the room.
   "Huh?"  Sonic had NO idea what just happened.  Nothing happened!  How
can talking to a computer save Sally's life?
   "I'm not going to explain it.  Not now, anyway.  Those who know, know.
Those who don't, don't need to.  How did this happen?"
   "I was keeping the creature busy and Sal was scanning it with Nicole.
Then it ignored me and whacked her with its tail."
   "So, the mighty Sonic Hedgehog was outsmarted by a big, dumb creature."
He could tell he made Sonic angry.  "Don't worry, it was my fault."
   "What do we do now?"
   "We wait for her to get better."  For a while, they just waited.  Then
Williams simply left.

   He was sitting on a log next to the power ring pool when Adam soon joined
him.  Adam sat down on the log, "What are you doing here?"
   "Waiting."
   "You're going to sit here for four hours?"
   "Two and a half.  By then she should be conscious."
   Adam thought about that for a while.  "Robotnik's gone," he finally said.
"There isn't much to do."
   "There's always these people to torment, it keeps them on their toes.
Every once in a while, we help them, that keeps them guessing.  Why are
they here?  Are they going to help us?  Should we trust them?  Sonic thought
we were here to kill the princess, that's a reputation if anything."
   No one else said anything for a while.  They could hear a noise coming
towards them.  It sounded much like a tiny hurricane or a breeze.  It kept
getting closer until it was directly over them, at which time it stopped and
Tails landed right in front of them, "Will Aunt Sally be okay?"
   "Tails, you worry too much.  When I say she'll be better than ever in
four hours, she will."
   "What will you do after she gets better?"
   "We'll get rid of that creature."
   "And after that?"
   "Our work will be done, we will leave."
   "But......I want you to stay."
   "I appreciate that.  There's only one problem: where are you in the chain
of command?  Who can you convince to get us to stay?"
   Tails had to stop and ponder.  Sonic wouldn't listen, Tails saw his
reaction.  Sally might after she found out Williams saved her life.  There
was only one person who would agree with him.  "Nina would listen to me."
   "Ah!  Nina!  Good, go get her.  She should be a part of this."  With
that, Tails was gone.
   "Why's Nina so important?" asked Adam.
   "She and Tails, and Sandra, are the only people here who actually trust
me.  They would back me up.  I'd consider them good friends."
   "Sandra?  The one who tried to kill you in the forest?  SHE is now your
friend but, saaaaay...THE PRINCESS isn't?"
   "The princess would never trust me, not even after I saved her life.
Sonic?  Maybe by some miracle.  Sandra does."
   "She shouldn't.  Tails shouldn't either."
   "But they do.  Don't you consider Nina a friend?"
   Adam thought about that.  "Yeah," he sighed, "okay.  But NOT Sandra."
   "You just don't know her well enough."  The conversation ended there.
   Not before long, Adam brought up an interesting point.  "We're pretty
lucky.  I save Nina's life, you save the princess' life, we help get rid of
this creature.  When the princess takes the throne, we're going to be
famous."
   "More than you think.  I also saved Tails' life.  And then there was that
thing with Sonic.  He would've been blown into a million, smoldering pieces
if it wasn't for me."
   "Well, I did save Kristen's life a few times."
   "I hear a challenge."
   "Okay, the creature is the deciding factor.  Whoever takes care of it is
the winner."
   "Done."

   Around two hours and thirty minutes later, Williams opened the door to
Sally's hut.  Adam followed him in.  Everybody was there, it was somewhat
crowded.
   "Adam!  Williams!"  Nina ran over to them.
   "I told you we'd see you again," reminded Williams.  He could see that
Sally was conscious.  "I guess we should start with introductions."  He made
his way to a corner of the room.  All eyes were on him.  "Everybody, I am
Gabriel Williams, but I go by Williams for reasons I don't want to go into.
This is Adam Lockard."  He dragged Adam into the spotlight.  "And this is
Kristen Taylor.  We're all from Wespero and we came here to find help to get
rid of this creature."  He took a position next to Sandra.  "Sandra
Nightweaver, she captured me a while ago and traded me to Packbell for a
hover unit.  But I still like her," he put his arm around her, "it was fun."
   No sooner did he finish his sentence than Sandra took him by the arm and
flipped him onto the ground.  There was a moment of silence--everybody was
shocked.  Then Williams began to laugh.  He got up and finished the
introductions.
   "Tails, for obvious reasons."
   "Actually, it's Miles, Miles Prower.  But everybody calls me Tails."
   "Okay.  Tails was with me when Sandra caught us.  Nina, I met her in a
hover unit some time ago.  Sonic Hedgehog, he just plain doesn't like me."
He walked over to Sally's bed, "And this is Princess Sally."
   "Princess Sally Alicia of the House of Acorn."
   "Whatever.  I just saved your life," he reminded her.  He still had three
more people to go.  "Somebody else can introduce the rest of you."
   Tails immediately stepped forward.  "This is Rotor and Bookshire
Draftwood.  And this is my brother, David Prower.  He's an android."
   "It's good to meet all of you," David greeted the guests politely.
   Williams gave him an evil grin.  "Android, huh?  As in...android.  Like
a big, walking computer.  Controlled by tiny, electrical impulses.  Just
waiting to be--Computer, scramble David!"
   David twitched a little, then fell to the floor.  Tails knelt beside him.
He shook David and asked him if he was all right, but nothing happened.
   "What have you done!?!"  Bookshire didn't necessarily like it when
somebody ruins a lot of his hard work and effort.
   "Okay, okay.  Sorry, but I haven't done that in a while.  Computer,
unscramble David."
   He got up, "You can't just turn me off like a piece of equipment!  I am
a living being like anyone else!"
   "Oh, calm down.  Think of it this way: I knock you unconscious in such a
way that there is no permanent damage and I can wake you up at any time."
The world went black.  The next he knew, Williams was waking up to a bucket
of water in his face.  He could feel the bump on his head, realized what had
happened, and began laughing.
   "How can he DO that?"  The more Sally got to know Williams, the more she
was confused by him, but, then again, doesn't everybody?  When she was well
enough to walk, Williams was placed in her now soaking wet bed.
   "I get it," said Williams.  "Knocked unconscious, brought back with a
bucket of water, no permanent damage.  I get it."
   "You're not supposed to get it, it's not a joke.  You're supposed to know
how David felt."
   "Princess, I knew how he felt, I was fully prepared for this.  I'll
admit, however, that I didn't think anyone would actually do it.  Who
DID do it, anyway?"
   "I did," Sonic stepped forward.
   "Adam already explained everything," continued Sally.  "He said you would
get up and continue what you were doing as if nothing happened."
   "Exactly.  Did he explain the creature?"
   "Yes, but I have a question.  Adam said you opened the void and it came
out, right?"
   Williams nodded.
   "I've been inside the void before, there are no giant insects in there."
   "Then my calculations were wrong.  Robotnik didn't have many details on
the void, I ended up doing most of the work myself.  There was a chance that
it wouldn't work when I opened it."
   "Where does yours lead?"
   "I don't know.  Maybe I'll have a chance to take you in some day."
   "That's not likely."
   Williams sat up, "Well, what's the plan?"
   "We don't have one yet."
   Williams groaned.  "I have one, but you won't like it."  He got out of
bed and headed for the door, but when he arrived, he stopped, "Almost
forgot.  Computer, deactivate all of Sally's nanites."

   After everybody was rounded up outside of the village, Williams gave
everybody an encouraging pep-talk.  "There is a giant creature out there
that could easily kill any one of you.  I brought it here, so you don't have
to help me get rid of it if you don't want to."  Nobody left.  "Since no one
has thought up a plan, I will present mine.  We save David's memory, David
jumps into the void, the creature follows, I close the void, you simply
build another android, everybody's happy."  There were a lot of objections
to this approach.
   "We can't 'simply' build another android!" stated Bookshire.
   "You must have some kind of instructions."
   "I'm not the same android that they build me to be," said David.  "I have
improved myself to become better than the original design."
   "Good for you.  Then we save YOUR specifications for later reference."
   "Just because he's an android doesn't mean we can sacrifice him to save
ourselves," defended Sally.
   "Well, Princess, do you have a better idea?"
   She did not.
   "Considering the circumstances," David spoke up, "it would be best to
follow Williams' plan."
   "There, ya' see?  Now for the second part: we can't all go.  David
obviously has to go because he's going to lure it back whencesoever it
came.  I'm going because no one else can open the void, even if it is the
wrong one.  The rest--"
   "I'm going with you," insisted Adam.
   "Of course."
   "Me too," volunteered Tails.
   "Fine."
   "If Tails is going," said Sonic, "I'm going."
   "Nope.  Too many people."
   "What!?!"
   "The rest of you can get to know each other better."

   After the necessary backups were made and the final good-byes said, the
group left for the Great Swamp.  For some odd reason or another the creature
had migrated there, its trail of destruction gave its new hiding place away.
They each said good-bye to David again and Adam went with him to the other
side of the creature.
   "Computer," ordered Williams, "open 'the void' twenty-five yards east of
the creature and close it as soon as the creature goes through it."  The
swirling helix again opened up.

   That was David's cue, "So long, Adam."
   "Sorry, but Computer, scramble David."  He jumped out from behind the
tree, waved his hands frantically, and called out to the creature.

   "What's he doing?" asked Tails.

   The creature noticed him and began chasing him.

   "Adam!" Williams tried to stop him, or at least get the creature away
from him.  "You demented fool!"

   It worked.  The creature heard him and turned to start chasing him.

   Williams didn't expect that to happen.  "Tails, run."
   "But--"
   "GO!"
   "I can't leave you!"
   There was nothing Williams could do at that point.  There was no place
for him to go, nothing for him to hide behind.  Even if he found a way to
escape, Tails was still there.  And the only thing between Tails and the
creature was him.
   "This'll be fun," he said under his breath.  The creature slashed at him,
he took the full force of the blow.  One gash in his left arm, the other in
his leg, and being knocked ten feet away--he expected worse.  The creature
moved in for the kill.

   It took a lot from Adam to regain the creature's full and undivided
attention, he ended up having to kick its back leg.  After that, the
creature simply followed him out of annoyance into the void.  That was it,
the crisis was over, and Adam was gone.

   "Williams?" Tails ran over to him.
   "Pain.  Pain is bad."  
   "Adam saved us, he took David's place."
   "I know, that's what gets me.  To save us, all he had to do was come up
with a better plan than I did.  But he went and got himself killed.  There's
no way that I can top that.  I think he killed himself just to annoy me."
   "Williams," Tails was surprised at him, "your best friend is...gone."
   "Yeah," he sighed.  "There's something wrong, though.  Adam wouldn't just
jump into a void."  He slowly got up.
   "Should you be walking?"
   "I'll be fine."
   "Do you forgive me?"
   "Okay, why?"
   "I should've listened to you.  If I had just left when you said so, then
you could've..."
   "Could have what?  Moved out of the way?  Yeah, right.  It doesn't matter
if you stayed, ran, or took my place, one of us was going to get hit, maybe
both.  Aren't you glad it was me?"
   "Well...no.  I mean, I don't want to see you hurt."
   "I'm trying to explain this to you.  Would you rather get your arm hacked
open, or have me, with my nanites that can fix almost anything, get my arm
hacked open?"
   "Well..."
   He put his arm around Tails and gave him a type of half-hug.  "Tails, I
could tell that when I first met you I was going to like you.  You are
extremely intelligent and need to work on your sense of humor, but that's
okay.  There are a LOT of things I can teach you, maybe you can visit me
sometime.  Just don't tell Sally you're going."
   "Maybe YOU can visit me."
   "Oh I will.  Every once in a while, at the most unexpected time, I'll
drop by and say 'hello.'"  He limped over to David's position, which was
still behind the tree.  "Computer, what is wrong with David?"
   "He has no recognizable command functions or interpretive data."
   "Computer, unscramble David."  It did.  David got up and tried to deduce
exactly what went on whilst he was out.  "Let's go," Williams started back
for Knothole.
   But as soon as he turned around, the void opened up again and Adam
popped out.  Immediately afterwards, it closed.  The trio ran (or limped as
the case may be) over to Adam, who was sweating and breathing heavily.
   "They need more oxygen in their atmosphere," he panted.
   "Well, that's what you get for being heroic," commented Williams.  He
helped Adam up and they started back for Knothole.  "I nearly get my leg
lopped off after I try to save you, and you nearly suffocate after you save
us."
   "I don't care--I won!"
   "Won what?" asked Tails.
   "We had a...bet going.  Whoever could get rid of the creature was
declared the winner."
   "There was nothing tangible at stake," added Williams.  "It was just a
matter of reputation.  Something you can check off on your 'things-to-do'
list.  Saved planet, check.  How did you get back, anyway?"
   "When you were unconscious I took your void programs.  I would never
jump into a void with no way to get back."
   "How was it in there?"
   "Nice place to visit.  I'm never going there again.  Promise me one
thing, Williams, don't ever open it again."
   "That's a problem.  See, I told the princess I'd take her in.  And Tails
might want to go.  Then I'd have to show Kristen also.  Maybe we could set
up an attraction..."

   "Tails!" Nina ran up to meet him.  They embraced, "Why is David here?
Did the plan work?"
   "It's hard to explain."
   Williams' wounds had healed a bit, but were still quite noticeable.
Kristen saw the torn clothing, missing scales, and dried blood and wanted to
know what happened.  He explained everything, including why David was still
with them.  "And now, Princess, we will be on our way."
   "Wait!" Tails stopped him.  "Aunt Sally, can't they stay here just one
more day?"
   She had to think for a minute.  "Ultimately, it's not my decision to
make.  You'll have to ask Sonic."
   It took some convincing from Tails and Nina, even Bookshire put in a good
word for them.  Maybe it was because Adam saved the planet, maybe it was
because Williams saved the princess, maybe even because Williams was
injured.  In the end, Sonic let them stay for twenty-four more hours, but no
longer.



   The End...

At least one other person here reads the Sonic list on a BBS, so you're 
not alone.

If you look at the headers of the messages you get, you'll see a From: 
field (the person who posted) and a Reply To: field (the mailing list). 
Which address your reply goes to depends upon your mail software.  Some
programs only use the From: field, which is not good because it's more
likely to be wrong.  Other programs only use the Reply To: field.  IMO,
the better-designed programs will show you both addresses and ask which
one you want the reply sent to.  This way, if both addresses are correct,
it's easier to reply to the list or directly to the poster according to
your preference. 

You can always use the Enter a new message command instead of the Reply 
command.  It's less convenient, but does ensure your reply goes to the 
address you intended.

Ask your SysOp if you need more help with getting your replies out.

I got my #23 yesterday, but I've not written up a summary for it yet.  It 
says PS#3 is out now, but I've not received it nor have I seen it in my 
local stores.  So far, only one of my local stores has PS#2 now -- and 
one store still has a lot of copies of the "In Your Face" special.

Hee hee.  I just found PS#3 at the comic shop today.

If I had it with me now I'd type up a summary myself [I'm suprised.. did
ANYONE get my summary of PS#2?  There were no responses to it].

Anyway.  Here's a hint.  Check out Sally carefully in 1 and two... It gives
some clues as to what's going on.

I don't recall seeing your PS#2 summary.  I know my summary did get out, 
but there were no responses either in direct mail or posted to the list.

Worry not: a summary of PS#2 is alive and well and currently residing in
my FAQ file.  Now, if the US Postal people will just get me the issues I
ordered....

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Oh, yeah, I have to agree.  I _really_ like Spaz's style.  It makes me sweat!
With Art Mawhinney drawing Princess Sally, I sure hope that Spaz is doing 
most of Sonic in Your Face #2.

I find that my local comic book store gets a given issue of Sonic in about
2 weeks before my subscription copy arrives in the mail (or on the comic
racks in 7-11), so I end up with 2 copies of each issue.  :-)

Ditto on that! :)  Definitely an inspiration, he is!  It's fabulous to see
such great talent coming to the Sonic comics these days.  Makes me want to
draw a couple comics myself!  Yum!

Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: The following represents the positions of neither ABC, Sega
nor DiC, but rather is a recap of scuttlebutt on the Sonic e-mail
group: DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.  If anyone has been in correspondence
with any of the parties involved, a more "official" explanation
would be appreciated...though it probably wouldn't be as much
fun.

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!


Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: The following represents the positions of neither ABC, Sega
nor DiC, but rather is a recap of scuttlebutt on the Sonic e-mail
group: DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.

The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind

The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship

mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson

Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.



[I am indebted to R.D.B. for the following, since the Sally
miniseries has yet to hit the shelves in this corner of Michigan-
-I've GOT to stop buying retail and subscribe!]

Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]

"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

I pick cute.

But the other sonic isn't so cool, he's more deformed. I mean he looks 
like he's in pain. Having that mouth can't be comforitable. :-)

cute! cute! cute! let's hear it for CUTE!!

...and my quick comments.

hff.gif: A shot of the Happy Fun Fox.  I've seen it before.  I'm not sure 
if I'd say it looks more like the SatAM or the American comic version.  
Pretty icky-looking noise on it, though.

sally.jpg: The first-season version of Sally (sans jacket), probably from 
SatAM promotional materials.  A little JPEG artifacting, but looks okay.  
ANyone got a second-season version?

tails1.gif: New for me, anyway.  A quick sketch of Tails in the style of 
the SatAM version.  Lines are a little clunky, and his fur color's too 
dark for my taste, but otherwise decent.

tails2.jpg: Someone else objected to the anime style of the drawing.  I 
don't agree per se-- I like the rendering of him in the debug screen on 
Sonic CD, f'rinstance (anybody got a grab of that?)-- but here I agree 
that something doesn't quite 'work'.  I think he doesn't look young 
enough; he's kinda vertically stretched or something, and looks more like 
the teenage Sonic then the cute innocent HFF we all know and love.  
tails_guitar.jpg is in the same style, but the proportions are better so 
it looks quite nice, IMHO.

On a tangential note: a while back, someone posted the address of an 
alternate Sonic GIF site, which I checked out (natch).  They had a few 
GIFs there that looked like they'd been ripped from the game data; frames 
of Sonic running, transforming into Super Sonic, going around loops, 
looking bored, that sort of thing.  Anybody know (a) what site that was 
and (b) who put those GIFs up?  I'd like to get in touch with them about 
some Tails binrips...

So who says he can't be both at the same time?  Personally, I think he 
looks very cute when he punches his fist up at the end of a level (in 
Sonic 3 & Knuckles), or clings desperately to a pole as water sweeps by, 
or gets bored and yaaaaaaawns (Sonic could probably fit his whole fist in 
there!), or... well.  (:3  I think, though, that you should have done 
something more visually interesting for Super Tails; maybe for Sonic 4 
you can give him Do Not Taunt fur?  (:3

Errr, since I haven't (yet) seen the message to which this replies, I 
ask: what other Sonic?

I'm sorry. I do that a lot. I really should read what I write before I send
it. I meant Tails, not Sonic. tails2.jpg in my ftp dir is what i was 
referring to.

This picture was actually taken from a "Sonic & Knuckles" promotional poster 
where all three of our heroes were standing on a hill.  There is 
perspective, rather than just a flat picture, hence his fist looks 
abnormally large... I do agree that Tails does look older than normal, 
though.

Tails_guitar was just a flat poster scan (from a Japanese Sonic calendar). 
 Therefore the proportions seem more "realistic."

You'll see once I post the remaining picts of Sonic and Knuckles from the 
same poster.  They both have the perspective look.  :)

I hate doing this since it's off topic (what on Mobius does a mailing 
list have to do with sonic?), but I just want to make sure everyone's 
clear on something.

if you reply to a message posted to the mailing list, it should use the 
"reply-to:" field, which is sonic@sard.mv.net (soon to be lists.mv.net, 
but that's a different story). If not that address, then it should go to 
the actual sender of the message.

But with some people (so far only Wallis@segaoa.com ) are sending it to
owner-sonic which is just the list owners of the sonic mailing list. Make
sure your messages are going to sonic and not owner-sonic. 

Look at the message headers to see what I mean by "reply-to" and "from".

There. glad that's out of the way. back to sonic...

That artwork is actually based upon the Japanese Tails model.

He *is* cute, and cool.  {grin}  That's why he's such a great character!  Of 
course, I don't need you tell you guys that, do I...  :)

I dunno.  I think it looks kinda cute.  (:3  And fitting of a kitsune, 
don't you think, that he shouldn't look quite real?  (American versions 
of Tails tend to make him look like his cranium's about to explode...)

Can you supply us with the whole promo poster, then?  Or do you only have

Oooh, I want!  (:3  (I finally got my Happy Fun Tails plush tail.  Goes

Which artwork?  The particular sequences I mentioned?  If so, what did

Not a chance.  I still have my 14-gemmed save position with Super Happy 
Fun Tails.  (:3

Many thanks to Mike Wallis and Ratman for putting the new images on the ftp site!

I liked all the new images, but my favorite is hff.gif.  The only thing harder to resist than a cute picture of Tails is Tails himself (g).

Besides more Tails, I'd also like to see more images of Sally, and maybe too a group pic of all the Freedom Fighters.

>From Sonic The Hedgehog,

	Hello friends and fans.  I recently uploaded TailsDraw2.jpg to
rat's ftp site.  Hope you enjoy the drawing I did and compare it with the
inset picture on that graphic.  :^)  See for yourself how good I can
enlarge and draw.  Rat - you should be proud as I did the image on
non-lined paper and thanks for the terrific graphic advice!  I also
touched up some of my favorite drawings. 

The Files I uploaded are : TailsDraw2.jpg
			   Sonic1.jpg 
			   Sonic2.jpg
                           Rotor.jpg 
And I'm working on a colored in version of the Neutral Zone as depicted in
Archie's comic book and will post it when it is done.  Its GIGANTIC, thus
taking me a while to do stuff, but it will be done shortly, hopefully. 
Stay tuned for more files.  Please let me know if the files viewed
correctly.  Thanks.

PS:  I am looking for a person who can help me by archiving the files.  I
know this site is the only one so far that can accomodoate files.  I can
donate more files, but I know ratman has limited space handy.  So please
let me know where else I can put the files I have ?

Haha!  :)  That's one way of looking at it, I suppose.

I'll do my best.  No promises, but we just may be able to sneak it in... :)

Unfortunately, the poster is 20x24, and thus too large to scan... I've 
scanned each character individually in order to at least give you guys 
something... Any suggestions on how I might get the entire posted scanned???

Yep, those sequences... Actually, all animations of Tails were based on the 
Japanese models.  I didn't do any of it, because both Sonic 3 and Sonic & 
Knuckles were released before I joined Sega.


Have a great weekend!

Remember the story Craig Moore and I are co-writing?  Yeah, that one.  In 
the still-developing story, we are now starting our first full day on 
Mobius.

Everyone on the mailing list is now on Mobius.  And if I recall 
correctly, everyone who returned the somewhat infamous survey has had 
their name mentioned at least once so far.  Those who did not return a 
survey or have subscribed recently are anonymous parts of any of four groups.

Two more notes for those who did return surveys.  1. It looks like 
everyone is going to get their first choice of location.  2. I hope to 
send out a new status report soon.  Unfortunately, my co-writer has 
experienced a major hardware failure.

> Tails, Sally, Sonic, and the whole gang are only a fictitious

I like to think cartoons create their own reality that exists apart from 
our reality.

Hi guys!

I finished converting Dan's "Sonic FAQ File" post into HTML earlier
today.  I had to make a few changes here and there to insure that it
would conform with HTML standard, but all the information is still 
there, with some extras I managed to include to make it more effective.
Part of the advantage to HTML is that you can select a highlighted 
section of text and instantly jump to someplace else.  A LOT of that is
in there.  You'll find it in my "Sonic the Hedgehog Advocate" section.

I thank Dan for allowing this project to go forward.  Hope all of you
like it.  I'll be watching the "Sonic FAQ File" for future updates in order
to keep everything as synchronous as possible.

Unfortunately, my VAX mail system uses the first From: field above for 
replies, not the Reply-To: field.  So if I want to reply to a message, I 
basically have to forward or send it (with my comments) as a separate 
message, which forces me to re-type the subject headers in.

When the list first started up, this wasn't the case; the first header was 
"sonic", not "owner-sonic", but it later changed.  Any reason why it can't 
be changed back for those of us with less than state-of-the art mail 
programs?

Thanks,

I'm going to upgrade majordomo to version 1.93 (we are now at 1.92). I hope
it doesn't do anything bad.

for now, i reverted back to the old version.
this is just a live test to make sure it's still working..

I wasn't aware of any Sonic-related Happy Meal toys.  Please send or post
details for inclusion in the Sonic Merchandise List.

There are probably even more things out there than I'm aware of.  So to
everyone on the list, if you've never seen the Merchandise List (or if
you've not consulted it lately), get a copy from the mailing list
software and see if there's anything else not included but should be.
Then post or mail details to me so an update can be issued.

(This is in response to a post that I saw a day ago on Sonic Net.
Unfortunately,
I have misplaced the mail message, and it's either buried under all the new mail
I have or otherwise lost.  But if you read this message, you'll know who
it's for.)

The Sonic graphics (the screen shots where he's shown running, jumping, etc.)
were located at this address:  http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk:80/Games/console/sega.
The last time I tried to download something from there, even the small files
took
more than a "Sonic Second".  In fact, I had to wait about 5 minutes to
download a
3 kB file(!)  If you want something from this address, get a good book to
read if it's
a large (say 50 kB or more for example) file.

My current modem technology consists of a SupraFax 14.4, running at 14.4 kbaud.
It shouldn't take this long to download a file (theoretically), but I guess
the connect-
tion there is either loaded, or they have a slow server, or there's some
other reason.

It went fast for me. I just tried it now. Maybe it was a passing thing, 
like something was bogging down the server, or the connection was bad 
(did you try pinging them? see if there were a lot of lost packets).

I noticed tails.gif is there. that's the cute-cartoony picture of the HFF.
That's probably where I got the picture from.

I was just on, and it was very fast for me.. almost as if Sonic himself 
was bringing the files to me.  It probably did help, though, that I was 
using lynx, a non-graphical Web browser for Unix (and DOS).

Eep.  For a while I thought this mailing list was dying but it seems to have
picked up again.

---

Yeah.. I know.. Tails is cute in all (in hff.gif) but my favotire picture
at Rat's site has to be 'sally.jpg'  Thanks Mike for providing that.

I was at the mall and again saw plush Sonics and Tails.  I'm rather 
disappointed at how Plush Tails turned out and so far haven't gotten one.
I got the plush Sonic though.  I think its the exact same brand as in the 
'sondoll.gif' (I've seen at least three different version of plush Sonic).

Didn't someone say a plush Knuckles was planned?  (I never heard plans for
a plush Sally... I'd like to see one though)

Speaking of things I'd like to see...

---

Screen Shots I'd Like To See:
  I think the final scene where Sonic (and/or Tails and/or Knuckes) jumping
toward the screen [from all Sonic games that I know of] might make a good
JPEGs.  If I had the equipment to do that kind of stuff I'd probably make 
JPEGs of those scenes myself :)

AT&T "You Will" Devices I'd Like to See.
  Ever see that AT&T "You Will" commercial with the little computer-dog 
'assistant' living in that woman's computer?  It might be fun to have
something like that but with Sonic and the rest of the Freedom Fighters.
You could use different Freedom Fighters for different tasks (and if one's 
busy another would take his/her place).  If you tried checking up on 'Sonic' 
while he was having trouble with your request the system might show 'Sonic' 
having a hard time on a mission dealing with Swatbots or something.  Sonic 
might make some snide comments if he had to deal with a computer using 
'Mario Brothers' or other Nintendo characters for its 'assistants'.  (Of 
course.. what happens if he deals with a computer which ALSO uses Sonic &
Crew for its agents?)
  Just a silly idea I came up with not long ago... but who knows.  By 2005
it might be commonplace.

-- 
 When asked.. "What do you want to see in the next 'Sonic' game?"
 James Sime replied, "Thats easy, I want ...
                     'The Sonic Friends Network with Dionne Robotnik'"

PS.                                                  ^^^^^ 
Um.. Mike Wallis?  Ya think Sega might consider a game like this?... 
Hrm..  Didn't think so.

	In warp space, Dulcy was unable to see anything in the
"otherspace" which she and David were now in, so she experienced
the flight utilizing her other senses.  She felt no push or pull
during warp travel, not even in the initial acceleration phase
when the graviton warp field accrued the energy to pass into FTL
space.  There was no feeling of warmth or cold, aside from the
heat that was generated in her from her instinctive response to
the potentially hazardous endeavor.  No sound was detected by
her sensitive dragon ears, nor any discernible odor from the
environment detectable with her nose.  Opening her eyes
slightly, she noticed a blinding white light that permeated the
visible universe.
	It then exploded into a flash of blue light as David
decelerated himself and Dulcy to a low-sublight velocity.  The
Cerenkov radiation from the dying warp field rapidly dissipated,
spreading its graviton shearing force throughout the sky.  They
had successfully returned to their normal universe.
	All her senses returned to her, the most prominent one being
her sense of gravity.  Without compensating for the differences
of transition from a gravimetrically-stable point in space to a
total loss of it, she began falling at a rate of 9.8 meters per
second squared.  A scream from Dulcy notified David of his
friend's sinking condition.
	A swoop downward executed by the vulpine plus a retrieval
spared the dragon from a certain demise.  From their location,
three kilometers above ground level, the alternative would have
most certainly be destructive.  Dulcy eventually became aware of
the fact that her decent had been terminated, plus the feeling
of warm paws and arms on her abdomen.  Able to control her wings
again, she flapped them, and felt the release of pressure from
her stomach, indicating that her savior determined that she was
flight-capable again.  She would live to be a Freedom Fighter
for another day.
	"Please forgive me, Dulcy," David said with a concerned look on
his face as he came to a hover a meter in front of her.  "I
apparently didn't allow you the required amount of time to act
upon the warp/realspace transition.  Are you injured in any way?"
	"Nothing besides my pride," Dulcy returned with embarrassment,
belatedly realizing that she had failed to use the very piece of
equipment given to her by evolution, as opposed to David's
bequest by complex design of his rotor/nacelles and many hours
of testing.  If only privately, she had been upstaged by an
artificial lifeform that probably wasn't even intended to be
flight-capable in the first place.  But David had progressed
beyond his original design, both in technology and mentality.
She knew in the back of her mind that the last thing her closest
comrade would think of was the feeling of superiority.
	The compuorganic fox apparently wasn't convinced by her
statement of health.  He activated all his sensors to
investigate the true nature behind the dragon's tone of voice.
His sensors downloaded the required data billions of times in a
nanosecond, and his computers checked and rechecked the data for
validity.
	Seeing this take place and realizing what David was doing, she
spoke with somewhat more control a second later, "No need to
look me over, David.  I'm fine.  I was just a little thrown back
by the sudden stop."
	He apparently wasn't completely satisfied with her explanation,
but also wasn't inclined to continue the conversation further on
what was obviously a situation more of disgrace than physical
harm, if only to Dulcy.  "I have located ten possible sites for
us to investigate," he began, now all Freedom Fighter Commander
again.  "There is an area of interest as a possible habitation
site 700.7 kilometers from our location.  It has an unusually
high concentration of metal, possible fuel resources, and water.
 Are you prepared for the operation?"
	"Yes," she dictated with more determination than she felt she
had.  "Let's go."
	She was having second thoughts about practicing her landing
procedure, but she and David had both signed an unwritten pact
to complete a mission and to keep a promise that they made the
past night.  For her to refuse would be futile, due to the fact
that her associate wasn't the typical kind of person that would
understand excuses.  You either agreed on a promise with David
and kept it, or you never approached him with the proposal in
the first place.  No gray area existed in his interpretation,
part of what made him the fox he was today.
	Two seconds later, she was reflecting on her vulpine
colleague's philosophy at another point in the space/time
continuum...

	...And en route to her first touchdown of the day.  She and
David were both flying (under their own power this time) above a
plateau, near the border of the Dark Mountains and the Great
Unknown.  Dulcy didn't exactly know what was down in that area,
but David had been able to study a great deal of geological data
about many locations on Mobius, from what little information
there was available at Knothole.  The Dark Mountains region was
at the forefront of his interest.
	'Dark Mountains,' his compuorganic computer systems instantly
identified.  'A 1.45 billion year-old exposed intrusion of
gabbro, formed by an unexplained and unusual rise of magma
through the crust.  Possibilities:  natural gaps in crust, or a
cavity induced by a meteor.  Meteor theory may explain the high
concentration of iridium and radiogenic potassium near the
Kathurc and Dueler age boundaries.  Has been subjected to time
and erosion, but apparently still remains prominent;  not worn
away.  Isostacy (the balance between erosion and rock rise to
compensate for displaced mass) may explain why the area has not
been lost to time.'  While spending a picosecond to formulate
his own interpretations about the geological significance of the
oldest known rock on Mobius, he executed a local scan of their
immediate point over the border.  What his sensors told him was
in the fifty kilometer radius he didn't exactly care for.
	Acting as nonchalant as he could giving the potential outcome
of their continued flight pattern over a now-designated
hazardous area, he spoke to the dragon, "Try over there, Dulcy.
That should permit you a long landing space."  He indicated the
desired area to her with a 5 microwatt phaser, sufficient for
location purposes;  not as a weapon.
	"Are you sure about this, David?" she asked, nervously.
	The only response from the black and gray vulpine was a stern
glare.  No arguments in regard to the proposition from him would
be listened to or considered.  That much was made clear sans
vocal dialect.
	"Going down," was all she could submit with resignation.  She
tilted her body down, continuing until she obtained a thirty
degree aspect with the ground.  She was able to maintain a
stable approach flight until she was about half a kilometer
above the granitic rock of her landing strip.  At that height,
her tension built into a gargantuan monster, clasping her in its
jaws.  First, her stability wavered;  then eventually developed
into more of an uncontrolled fall rather than a controlled
flight.
	Noticing his companion's deviation, David conjured a plan to
give Dulcy something else to focus on.  Matching his velocity to
hers and surpassing it by 20%, he flew under her abdominal
region, then grasped her pouch lip as he disengaged the rotation
of his rotor/nacelles.  They were both quickly approaching the
ground, so it was necessary to act with as much haste as
possible.
	He called to his peer, "Dulcy, to what degree do you enjoy my
company?"  He retained his grip on her pouch, the induced wind
shear now threatening to strip him away from his stronghold as
the dragon accelerated toward the ground.
	"A lot. Why'd you ask, David?" she inquired, baffled that her
friend would demand such information from her at a time like
this.
	"Prove it to me," he commanded as he expertly flipped himself
into her pouch.  He had no intention of leaving it, regardless
of the outcome of her landing.
	The pressure mounted, only this time of a different sort.  In
Dulcy's mind, the effects of the landings that she would
normally perform were now out of the question.  This time, David
would be right under her if the touchdown wasn't successful.  A
mistake here would be injurious, if not fatal, to him.  Being
compressed between approximately one metric ton of dragon plus a
magnitude of two billion times that from the granite and
acceleration due to gravity wouldn't exactly allow the vulpine
to be in an amicable mood afterwards.  It would have to be
perfect the first time, period.
	Her approach straightened out at about 100 meters above her
target.  At about fifty meters above ground, she gradually
raised her body to a point beyond being perpendicular to it,
taking precautions with her wings and the rest of her
aerodynamic aspect.  She slowed as the aerodynamic drag took
effect, but she had compensated a bit too much for her velocity
decrease.  Her landing pattern would have been excellent.  The
only problem was, in order for it to be so, the granite plateau
had to be in a position two meters higher than it was then.
Both fox and dragon experienced a mutual session off attraction
to the dense igneous rock, then a debilitating dizziness induced
from their resonance to the impact.
	David's graviton differential stabilizers dissipated the shock,
conducting the resonance and spreading it throughout his body to
prevent a focused point in the field.  The majority of it
transferred to Dulcy, enhancing her own disorientation.  She had
a tenuous contact with the ground, swaying forward and back, as
if unable to decide what to do next.  He leaped out of her pouch
to the more stable granite, and used his navigational deflector
to assist the beleaguered dragon front-down.  The field created
an air cushion between the excited gravitons and her body, and
gradually compressed downward until she was at a stable position
on the ground.
	She remained sprawled out in that position for about a minute,
then woke up from the shock.  "Ooohh, hello Ma.  Yes, I cleaned
the cave," she warbled.  She then continued muttering phrases
that either only she understood, or that came out by a reflex
reaction to a particularly unfavorable landing.
	Hoping to give Dulcy a reference point to the present, David
said, "Excuse me, Dulcy, but I don't believe I understood your
mannerisms in that dialect.  Would you please explain that to
me?"
	THAT gave her the incentive she needed.  After forcing the
disorientation out of her head, she rose back to a standing
position, regarding her comrade with nervous concern.  David
returned the focus of attention, only with look of mock
discordance.  The two Freedom Fighters, commander and
subordinate, gauged each other with a novel intensity.
	David finally spoke again, sparing his female associate the
trial of wordless communication.  "You don't wish to continue
our friendship, do you Dulcy?"  Despite what could have been a
adverse situation for him, he wasn't in a mood to be severe.  In
fact, he was willing to be almost jovial about it.
	Dulcy, on the other paw, did not anticipate the fox's
approximately convivial attitude, and reacted accordingly.  "Oh
no, I really do, David.  It's that...weeelll, the ground was
coming up too fast , and I had to do..."  She trailed off into
hopeless babble about the events that transpired in the landing,
while her commander gradually felt an increase in his humor
register.  When the register read 256, he initiated an
uncontrollable laughter subroutine.
	After he had reacquired some of his control, he said, "I'm
afraid I am the one who must apologize, Dulcy.  I just find the
situation so...humorous.  I thought that you, of anyone, would
have no trouble knowing exactly where ground level was."  More
guffaws from David, then Dulcy chimed in her own, as she thought
the matter over herself.
	David's slackened muzzle immediately contorted and hardened
into a grave stare.  While he and Dulcy were both learning more
about each other's humor, his sensors had been scanning the
entire area around them within a fifty kilometer radius.  Within
that radius was a concealed base (which explained the
high-metallic concentration).  He counted the Hover Units,
SWATBots and other robots in the base, along with other items of
interest: fusion and geothermal power sources, advanced computer
technology, and weapons systems.  David had detected all of this
on his first scan pass in the air, and again here on the ground.
 He had anticipated that the remote laser defense systems would
be able to strike them down from the air.  What he HAD NOT
anticipated was that the 1.56 MW laser emitters and targeting
systems had greater than 180 degrees of vertical axis
displacement capability, since the apparent design indicated
otherwise in his scan.
	He was correct in the assumption, but the lasers were
apparently able to obtain more vertical axis displacement by
permanently damaging their constrictive outer shells.  One of
the lasers had an emitter tube in this configuration, and also
had both Freedom Fighters detected and targeted.  An attosecond
after David detected that the optical targeting sensors had a
definite sight picture, a 630 kW discharge of focused red light
was expelled from the emitter.  The beam traveled at 300
megameters/second to its targets, the air in the immediate
vicinity of the focused light discharge screaming with protest
as the lethal energy forced its way to the ground.

Temporal Notice:  The events detailed here take place in early
fall (October 12th by Terran equivalent), year 3236.

Present day...

	The month of September had been a tedious and very difficult
one for all the Freedom Fighter groups.  Once every thirteen
years, for climatological reasons unknown, the winter season had
a rather malicious habit of arriving too promptly for those that
were unprepared for it.  The end result:  Knothole had been
almost been at the level of desperation in supply distribution;
since after the war ended with Robotnik about six months before,
it had become the major control center of the Freedom Fighter
groups by default.  Since the locus of many of the tunnels was
Knothole, the commanders had their hands full attempting to
organize so many people into such a small space AND direct them
to the appropriate centers for cargo shipping.  This was a
tedious process, since they only had a few Hover Units, and a
Hover Unit can only contain a limited amount of cargo.
	Knothole was crowded in many ways more than one.  Many of the
members from the other groups moved there not very long ago,
either to escape from unfavorable climate, be closer to their
intimates, or for various other reasons.  Unfortunately, this
began to create an overpopulation bottleneck in Knothole,
considering that the habitable zone was previously designed to
maintain the original residents plus 25% surplus.  Knothole was
now at 35%, making the situation disturbing, and nearly
intolerable for Sally, since the majority of the burden was hers
to cope with.
	'As much as I like them,' Sally said to herself in her
thoughts, 'one of these days those people are going to have to
find a new home.  This overcrowding is really putting a cramp in
my administrative duties, for both Knothole and everywhere else.
 I never thought it would be so difficult to work with all these
extra people!  Who knows, maybe some of this weather will drive
them off...I hope.'
	A rapping sound emanating from her door snapped her mind to
reality and from the universe of her thoughts.  She walked to
the location of the sound and opened the door.  Of course, she
should have remembered.  Only David and Tails would ever signal
that low on a door relative to everyone else.
	"Why, Tails," Sally said as benignly as possible, trying to
keep the stress from the past month plus now out of her mind.
"Please, come in."
	The little red fox hesitated for a second, for he couldn't miss
the general impression that she was somewhat perturbed.  He then
entered, after analyzing the situation in his mind.  She wasn't
angry at him;  just irritated, probably for the reason that
nearly everyone else was.  That knowledge still didn't resolve
any of his reluctance, however.  He scanned over what he could
see in her hut.  The place was a disaster area, which was very
uncharacteristic of her;  except for when she was under high
levels of tension that she was incapable of dispensing with.
	"Gee," Tails began, trying to resonate his voice in a joking
manner and failing at the attempt, "are you sure it's safe for
me to come in here?"  He chuckled a bit, nervously, belatedly
uncertain that his faux jovial attitude would present him with
the desired result.
	His suspicions were correct, and for once wished that they were
not.  All Sally did was fix him with a cold, hard stare for
about ten seconds.  As much as he desired to erase that
expression from his mind's eye, he couldn't.  She captured his
gaze, and wouldn't release it under his accord.
	As if realizing what had transpired, she immediately averted
her harsh regard.  "Oh, I'm sorry, honey," she finally
responded, nearly in tears.  "I didn't mean to look at you like
that.  It's just that...I've been under a lot of stress lately,
and..."  She disengaged her monologue, not knowing how to
continue her apology to the little cub.
	Tails went over to her in a gesture of reassurance, and
embraced her.  "It's OK, Aunt Sally," he stated with sympathy.
"Nearly everyone's been this way for the past few weeks, except
David."
	It was her turn for a faltering guffaw.  "David?" she asked,
observantly and somewhat disconcerted by the reference.  "The
only time I've seen David irritated about something is that time
he had a system-wide failure before he completely rebuilt
himself.  I don't know if ANYTHING else perturbs your brother or
not."
	"Well, that been the only thing so far," he ventured, "he
hasn't gotten mad about anything el-"
	Another interruption from the direction of the door.  From the
general location of the sound, it had to be David, but appended
to the knock was a high level of insistence.  She opened the
door and saw David standing before the doorway, with a look of
extreme distress on his face.  Sonic stood beside him, the
normally cavorting hedgehog looking equally distraught.  Aspects
that were uncharacteristic of the David and Sonic she knew.
Something was horribly wrong.
	"Hiya, Sal.  Hi, big guy," the hedgehog greeted nervously.
	"Greetings, Aunt Sally," David dictated politely, despite the
despairing mask he wore.  Seeing his vulpine familiar next to
her, he continued, "And to you, Tails.  May we be allowed to
enter?"
	"Why...yes, certainly.  Come right in, both of you," she
answered, careful to keep the expectancy out of her voice.
	She knew now wasn't the time to make demands, and that her
friends would eventually notify her of the unspoken calamity.
David was a fox of truth, and the truth would reveal itself when
he regained his composure so that he could speak as a composed
observer of events.  Sonic was usually more at ease with
reporting potential or known problems, but the lack of response
told her that he either preferred to allow David to explain the
situation since David would present the information in its
entirety, or that it was so severe he couldn't face it himself.
Sally and Tails sat on her bed, watching the fox and hedgehog
pair stand and reflect on Knothole's status.  A few minutes
later, the fox altered his look of despair to one of
seriousness, and that was her cue that he was prepared to
disclose the information he was so reluctant to make known to
her before.
	"What happened out there, David?" she demanded kindly.
	"I have taken the liberty as a Knothole Freedom Fighter
Commander to assist a fellow officer in assessing the supply
manifests," he initiated, with the extreme dread literally
dripping from his voice, "and Sonic and I have concluded that we
do not have a sufficient supply of reserve food stock to survive
the winter."
	This was a very devastating report for Sally, and she knew that
if this knowledge was made public, it would inevitably promote a
state of alarm for the rest of Knothole.  Besides the permanent
residents of Knothole, there were the other members of the
Mobius Freedom Fighter groups to consider as well.  And the
influx of new residents gradually increased every month at the
least, sometimes even by the week.  Hearing David report the
potential calamity only served to portray the situation in its
entirety, with the proof as tenacious as granite.
	"Who else besides us knows about this?" she inquired, as if
expecting a riot to erupt anytime now.
	"We are the only four in Knothole who have the knowledge of the
food supply statistics," David reassured, but cast a vacant
stare directed toward the floor as he continued.  "However,
maintaining the subject under covert guard will merely delay the
inevitable;  not prevent it.  The others will more than likely
learn of the truth, if not now, then in the near future.  It
will become necessary for us to inform the rest of Knothole
about the reserve food shortage anyway, so in either case we
would have a responsibility to prevent panic and rioting."
	The compuorganic vulpine missed nothing.  'It's days like these
when I wish David WASN'T so perfect,' she thought.  'Maybe if
just a few little white lies were programmed in there somewhere,
letting us know that things were all right, even though they
might not be.'  Yet, deep down inside, she knew that for him to
do so would be a sin against his programming and moral beliefs.
	"What about shipping the surplus from other bases?  How long
would that take?"  Sally asked, in order to get a better idea of
how severe the state could be.
	Sonic answered for her.  "No way, Sal.  It could take days, and
we don't have that time."
	Tails finally spoke after he saw that the preliminaries of the
situation had been established from the verbal exchange.  "What
can we do about this, David?" he asked his relative, the one
ultimately in command of the circumstances.  "How hard could it
be to repair the replicator?"
	Addressing both Tails and Sally this time, David responded,
"The reports I've received from Rotor and Bookshire are not in
our favor.  The supply of replacement hardware has nearly been
depleted, and even if the replicator did become active again, we
no longer have the base organic stock necessary for food
replication.  We do have the required chemicals to create the
organic stock, but we also do not have the hardware to overhaul
the replicator."  A long pause as he compiled and resolved the
thoughts in his mind.  "No, the only alternatives I can consider
at this point and time would be to find suitable areas on Mobius
for our surplus population to inhabit, locate a food resource
area that we might conceivably be able to transport raw stock
from, or locate the required hardware for the replicator.
Unless either of you have other suggestions, I propose sending a
survey party to analyze the potential success of executing the
plans I specified."  He waited patiently for an answer from
Sally and Tails, for he and Sonic had already examined the
matter at length before approaching Sally.
	The young fox and the more senior ground squirrel regarded each
other with anxiety, as if to say, "I don't.  Do you?"  No
resolution of the implied question for other theories of dealing
with the problem at hand was forthcoming.  They then returned
their attention to the black and gray fox, then to the blue
hedgehog.  Neither had to receive verbal interpretation of the
silence indicated by Sally and Tails.
	After inspecting his internal chronometer for an attosecond,
David decreed, "Very well, then.  The investigatory detail will
depart at 1000 hours tomorrow, seeing as-", he indicated the
illumination level outside, which was gradually grading toward
darkness as the sun extended its contact with the horizon, "-it
would be inadvisable to do so now."
	"Who do you plan to take?" Sally inquired.
	"As of now, the proposed party consists of me and Dulcy.  If
anyone else wishes to-"
	An interruption from Sonic.  Not verbal, but his reaction was
more than explanatory enough to convey his opinions about having
Dulcy in a mission when there was more than likely to be flying
involved.  He seized Tails by the sides of his chest, and darted
with him out of Sally's hut, in an effort to spare himself and
his comrade from another of Dulcy's flights.  Sally could only
stare at the unannounced and rushed departure, whereas David
placed his right paw on his forehead, sighing.
	"I had predicted the probability of this occurrence," he said
with reservation to a point off in space, "and it looks as if I
was correct.  Next time, I will pay more attention to my
predictive subroutine."
	After finally regaining some of her composure, Sally voiced her
shock at the situation.  "I never saw Sonic take off like that
before, especially not about Dulcy.  Is something wrong, David?"
	He responded, "Nothing beyond the usual faulty landings that
she executes.  Apparently, Sonic isn't the only one that shares
the fear of being part of a mission with Dulcy.  This belief has
already spread through the rest of Knothole," he finished, with
obvious sympathy for the dragon.
	"How bad is it now?" she continued.
	"I believe at this phase every one has lost faith in Dulcy to
properly correct her landings.  Especially from the incident
where she impacted with ten huts after falling victim to a wind
shear pattern on her final approach.  She and ten others were
injured in that crash."  His computers and organic memory cells
accessed the appropriate memory in question, and images in his
mind's eye formed of him valiantly defending Dulcy, noticing how
no one else would subscribe to his explanations.  Not even Dulcy.
	There were the unspoken incidents of similar, countless
failures in nearly all the touchdowns that Dulcy made.
Invariably, she would land in the same fashion:  lose her
balance, then fall forward, scraping her chin on the ground, not
to mention jarring her passengers.  The rest of the Freedom
Fighters eventually lost faith in Dulcy's abilities, and
publicly made that point clear.
	"Well," Sally stated after thinking over the dragon's public
appearance, "the only thing that we can do now is try to build
up her confidence, and that of everyone else's in her."
	"I concur," the fox agreed.  "I just so happen to have an
experimental technique to bolster her confidence and perfect her
landing procedure."
	His female comrade looked at him, as if surprised that a
solitary vulpine could perform such a feat.  She had her doubts
about David's success in providing the dragon with the
initiative for flying and going out in public again.
	Noticing the nature behind the dissension, he said, "It will be
successful, Sally.  Trust me."
	She chuckled, remembering who was famous for submitting that
particular phrase.  "OK, David," she finally said, smiling.  "I
believe you."  If Sonic had done so, she wouldn't have believed
it.  Knowing David's record for truthfulness restricted her
standard reflexive "Oh, I hate it when you say that" retort.  If
her young colleague believed that the undertaking was to result
in a favorable outcome, then it would be so.  She playfully
tugged on his cheek, knowing that he would teasingly despise her
for it.  She then kissed his olfactory sensor, with the
knowledge that the reaction would be humorous as well.
	Her suspicions were no further from the truth.  The juvenile
fox directed his gaze toward the floor, rubbing the protesting
sensitivity out of his nose.  After the uprising had dissipated,
he lowered his arms to his sides while compressing his paws into
dangerous-looking fists, brought his face into full view of
Sally's field of vision, and set his expression into one of mock
contempt.  She parroted the threat to him.  Laughter exploded
from the hut as they lovingly embraced each other.  This was the
most rewarding occurrence for Sally in the past three weeks, and
she intended to savor every second of it.
	After David regained control of his emotional state, but still
visibly feeling the residual effects of the last fifteen
seconds, he spoke.  "Now that we both understand each other, I
believe I have business to attend to.  Good night, Aunt Sally."
	"Good night, David.  Good luck with Dulcy," she replied.
	"Remember: this fox ALWAYS keeps his word."  And with that last
statement, he exited from her hut, walking toward Dulcy's.
	A deafening guffaw from the background immediately after David
was out of the field of view.  Sally snickered for a few
seconds, then began the task of organizing her disorganized
domicile.  The stress, at least for today, had been alleviated.

	Having dispensed with the effects of what transpired in the
past minute, David recomposed himself into his more reserved
manner.  He tapped on Dulcy's door, then patiently bided his
time for her response.  He received his invitation five seconds
later.
	"Go away," the dragon demanded, the irritated and morbid sound
of her voice indicating her interest for solitude.
	"Dulcy," the vulpine called genially, "it's me, David."
	"DAVID?!" she exclaimed, apparently surprised that out of all
the others in Knothole, her closest advocate would arrive to
visit her.  "Oh, nonononononono," she mumbled in belated regret
for her previous remark.
	The fox's sensitive hearing heard the dragon's racing steps,
the audio frequency increasing with the Doppler shift as she
approached the door.  The door burst open, expelling a small
amount of air from inside.  She immediately, but gently, picked
him up, then dashed back into her hut with him cradled in her
arms as if he were an infant.  The door created a clattering
report as it regained contact with the doorway.
	Looking down on David with astonishment and embarrassment, she
whispered so that only she and he could hear, "It's nice to see
you again, David.  But you really shouldn't be here."
	"Why is that?" he queried, in a slightly more audible voice.
His face contorted from one of amazement at Dulcy's response to
one of a cynical nature.
	"I'm bad luck.  Everyone knows that," Dulcy explained in a
beleaguered tone.  "No one wants to go out with me anymore.
I've lost my interest in flying, since there's nobody to be with
me."  She lightly placed her ally on the floor and turned her
head away from him, as if to spare him from a curse.
	"Dulcy," David commenced, now in mock disgrace, "you insult me.
 I don't subscribe to the 'popular' theories concerning you;
therefore I have no place in the universally-inclusive
'everyone'."  He paused to permit the implied significance of
the delivery take effect.  The response was unfavorable, for
Dulcy didn't redirect her head toward him.  He was prepared to
entrust his life to her, and she didn't take heed of the
unspoken message.  In favor of something more candid, he
ordered, "Dulcy, I want to see you at the bridge at 1000 hours
tomorrow.  We have an exploratory mission to perform for food
supplies, hardware for the replicator, and for possible
habitation sites for our excess population here at Knothole.  I
require you to be prepared for it before that time."
	It was the dragon's turn to be taken aback by the unexpected.
"You REALLY mean it, David?" her face deformed with the extreme
amazement.  "YOU want to go on a mission with ME?  I didn't know
you cared about me so much," she warbled, whimpering with
gaiety.  She very gently picked her comrade up again, and hugged
him, her hot tears plummeting to the fox's head.
	"Of course I care about you," he assured, returning the embrace
to Dulcy.  "I am a Freedom Fighter Commander, and your comrade.
I would not have the status I maintain now if I didn't consider
the personal side, the needs of my subordinates.  I'm still the
David you always knew, Dulcy.  Even if I don't always have the
opportunity now to be with everyone here in Knothole, I love
them all as my friends, and even as family.  And I am proud to
have you as a sister in our extended family."
	"Oh, David," she said with a kind of gratified sadness,
clutching him tighter against her torso.  "This is so touching.
You're growing up, just like your brother."  She then presented
him with a full-bodied dragon kiss that reeked of hydrogen
sulfide.  She then returned him to his original position on the
floor.
	"I meant what I told you, Dulcy, and I want you to remember
that I'm available to assist you with every means I am capable
of.  Now if you will excuse me," he said as his dermal sensors
indicated a slightly higher degree of water on his skin, plus
the imposed and unpleasant smell, "I believe I need to continue
my shower.  See you tomorrow at 1000 hours."
	"I'll be there," the now exuberant dragon replied.

	As David walked away from the double-huts of his two closest
female companions, he pretended not to notice that Sally and
Dulcy were covertly watching him.  He then heard a joyous
"Yeeha!" as continued his cadence.  The unanticipated comeback
from the pair made him halt, and body visibly cringed in
exaggerated astoundment.  Tittering from the background
indicated their appreciation.  The soaked fox executed an
about-face, as if to defend himself from a stealthy adversary.
His visible light grids detected nothing, but his IR sensors
located Sally and Dulcy, "hiding" from him under their windows.
	The vulpine shook his head with a small degree of awe.  'Now I
have the knowledge that part of my duty as a Freedom Fighter
Commander is complete,' he thought.  'When I have reinsured that
level of happiness in two of my friends despite the general
trend of the day, I know that I have been able to commit myself
to their necessities, and succeed.'  He engaged his
rotor/nacelles, and flew off toward his and his brother's home.

	After arriving at the hut that he and Tails shared, he knocked
on the door to signal his brother.  He heard Tails walk from the
bed to the door with his noise ranging circuitry counting every
otherwise imperceptible impact on the floor.  The door slid
easily past the entryway, and his vulpine familiar was standing
before him, prepared to permit him passage.
	David spoke first.  "Freedom Fighter Commander Delivery
Service," he dictated, as if trained to do so.  "If I'm not
mistaken, I believe I have your order.  And you are...Tails, am
I right?"
	Tails chuckled at first, but then noticed something unusual
about his relative.  "Eeew, David.  What happened?" he
questioned, before he pinched his nose to hold back the stench.
	"A very enthusiastic dragon happened to me," the drenched black
and gray fox replied.  "If I may be permitted...?" he asked,
indicating the bathroom.
	"Sured, goo rgiht ahaed," the other said, refusing to disengage
the fingerlock from his nose before David was in a slightly more
presentable condition.  He kept a vigilant watch on his family
member before the other disappeared into the bathroom for a
shower.  After the door closed, Tails let out a long hard
breath, attempting  to recover from the temporary constriction
of his sinuses.  He then walked over to the bunk bed, and took
his position on the top bed.
	David came out from the shower five minutes later, smelling
like he had used copious amounts of shampoo and deodorant to
dispel the evil aroma.  His fur was still slightly damp and
frizzled from the static electricity, creating the image of a
black and gray fuzzball.  After reactivating his antistatic
subdermal field, his fur returned to its original orientation
flat on his skin.  He then traveled to the bunk bed to join his
comrade.
	"You mean Dulcy did that to you?" the red vulpine asked.
	Ascending to the top bed, the counterpart said, "Yes, Tails,
she did."  After reaching the bed, he crawled over to sit by his
confidant.  "Merely part of being a Freedom Fighter Commander.
You receive the opportunity to know your people more..." he
stuttered, his electronic thesaurus failing to find a word that
would properly express the situation.  He found none that filled
the requirements, even taking the clock/instruction speed into
account by every attosecond.  "Intimately," he finally ventured.
	"Eeeew!  All that kissing and stuff, it's gross, David!  Yuck!"
came the derisive reply from his kinfox.
	"It's not completely undesirable, Tails.  Besides, from what
I've seen between you, Nina, and Vixie, I would have considered
you to be less reserved on such matters," the compuorganic
jovially retorted.  The only response he got from his brother
was a significantly slackened lower jaw.  Stolidly maintaining
his grin, David continued, "I rest my case.  And don't be
concerned;  it's our little secret."  He saw the other's stress
potentials decrease with each second.
	Calm enough to speak again, Tails submitted in interest, "How
far did it go?"
	"Nothing beyond an delightful embrace and an excellent kissing
session," David returned, knowing exactly what his
relative-by-law was ultimately referring to.  He sighed with
resignation.  "We are too junior in age and inexperienced to
concern ourselves with expanding our horizons in that fashion."
The electronic thesaurus didn't fail David this time in his
search for the appropriate phrase.  "Although," he continued
more seriously, "that will not be the case for you in the near
future.  As for myself, I may never know."
	What David was referring to was the fact that Tails had just
turned a year older in the late summer, effectively making him
eleven years old.  This would only be the beginning of the
experiences that Tails would have, and probably would peak
around his thirteenth year.  Basically stated, it would be the
time that he would publicly and privately become more interested
in the opposite sex, and Tails was already on his uphill race
toward that mountain peak.
	As for David, he was a recent construct, so it was far too soon
to determine what his reactions would be.  In his upgrade
session that he made to prevent the threat of total
deactivation, he added multiple computer controls to the organic
counterparts, in order for him to maintain a higher level of
control over the organic body functions.  This included
regulation of his hormonal levels, appended with controls on
their "target cells".  The end result:  David had duplex
negative feedback loops (organic/computer) to delimit his body
functions in a homeostatic balance.  The possibility of his
organic system revolting was possible, even in his advanced
control state;  however, it was highly improbable.  In the event
that did occur, David's personality was "hard-encoded" in both
his positronic and organic brain components, with a small
percentage of provisional rewritable code which would be
analyzed intensively before incorporation.  He would still have
strict control, and any hormonal imbalances were more likely to
be deliberately induced, in "proaction" with a situation rather
than "reaction".  In other words, he would take control as much
as possible;  not be the subject of control by the situation.
There were, of course, rare cases where David was more likely to
"react", due to his focusing on another subject matter rather
than everything at once.  He was advanced;  not perfect.
	What everyone else at Knothole regarded in David wasn't his
technical aspects or vulnerabilities.  They treated him more
like a close friend;  not a highly advanced machine.  Their
comrade had feelings too, whether they were generated from what
"emotions" could be defined as, or from computer coding.  It
made no difference, because they existed regardless of their
origin.  One of the more prominent pieces of his personality was
his mental maturity.  Even though David was constructed as an
eleven year-old fox, he behaved like someone far beyond the
maturity of all the Knothole residents combined.  He had been
(and still was) accused of being more "adult" than the adults in
Knothole, astonishing for someone of his age.  He never looked
on the attribute as a proof of superiority;  to him, it was part
of his mental programming that made him the unique fox he was.
	"Don't sell yourself short, David," the loving scion decreed.
"You can still grow up, right?  Is there more you can do?"
	The philosophical one conceded.  "Yes, I can.  Mentally, I
still have the capability to develop, and I could be accused of
being more adult than everyone else than before.  As far as my
endoskeleton is concerned, it's capable of minor controlled
growth, and THAT is only for any necessary repairs to the
metallic frame.  Nothing more."  He paused for a second,
projecting at least one million times how his future would be
compared to his relative.  "From the probable outcome, Tails,"
he continued, "I will be your little brother for quite some
time."
	"Well," the other reported kindly, "maybe in height, but you'll
always be a big brother to me in heart."
	David was disconcerted by the return.  "Thank you, Tails.  I
had no knowledge that you felt that way about me," visibly taken
aback by the unexpected delivery.  One of the rare times where
he could only react.
	"Yes, I do, David," Tails said, imitating an earlier statement.
 "Merely part of being a Freedom Fighter Commander's brother."
	No laughter passed between them, but they did smile as they
hugged each other reverently.  David then dropped to the floor
and took his position in his bed.  The fox pair fell asleep in a
matter of seconds, for all was right in the world for them now.
Tomorrow was another day to be concerned with, but only tomorrow
would it be met with tenacity.  Now was a time for sleep;  an
intensive day was ahead.

* * *

	Normally in order for David to sleep, a audio filter program
lies active, disregarding undesired noise that would otherwise
keep him awake at night.  Some of those sounds included:  wind
passing through leaves, footsteps (those identified as
"friendly"), snoring, and various other noises.  One of the
audio patterns that was permitted to bypass the filter was the
knocking on the hut door.  And the power of the bypassed audio
was so powerful (though in actuality, it was a tapping), that
could feel his entire body resonating with the sound.
	'Signal from doorway,' his mind automatically registered after
determining the range and direction.  Investigating his internal
chronometer, he thought, '0250 hours 36.798969695055 seconds?!
This had better be important.'  He slowly rose from his bed, and
walked to the doorway.  He opened the door, and found Dulcy
standing before him.
	"Dulcy," he asked in a whisper, "what purpose have you arrived
here to serve?"  He was somewhat irritated from the inauspicious
time for waking up, but (thankfully) his verbal frequency
circuits smoothed out the harsh tones that were not so
well-intended.  Unfortunately, the same was not true for his
facial expression.
	"Oh, I'm sorry to wake you up so early, David," the dragon
replied apologetically.  "Maybe I should come back at a better
time."  She began rotating her body to permit her departure.
	"No, wait," David ordered, warmly this time.  "I'm already
awake, so you may speak to me if you so intend.  Just maintain a
low whisper.  Tails isn't as amiable as I am from being woken up
at this time of day," he said, indicating the slumbering Tails.
	"OK," the dragon reassured.  After entering, she said, "I'm
really glad that you decided to take me on a mission, David.
Things are really getting a little cramped around here, with the
feeling that nearly everyone is breathing down my neck."
	"I understand," the vulpine concurred.  "It's gratifying to see
that you are still willing to undertake such a task, considering
the stress you have been experiencing."
	"Yeah, well," she responded, "you really woke me up, David.
Told me that I still have a chance to do something right for a
change, and that someone still believes in me."
	"Sometimes, Dulcy," the fox said philosophically, "that's part
of what we need.  But believing in yourself is the most
important aspect.  Otherwise, all the care and attention in the
world won't make a difference;  it has to originate from YOU.
Do you truthfully feel confident enough in yourself to take that
first step?" he said while pointing to her for emphasis.
	"Yes, I do," she said solemnly.  "I WILL do my best today."
	"In that event," he began, "I suggest that you go to sleep.
Otherwise, your best will not be enough to assist you in
attaining the goals you seek for the future."  He notated the
time on the wall video display.
	She yawned in agreement.  "Oops, excuse me.  I am kinda pooped.
 Thanks a lot, David," the dragon said, and offered her paw.  He
returned the gesture, and she shook his paw with a strong,
determined grip.  That was all the persuasion that David
required to know that Dulcy was ready to face one of her worst
problems.  His presence strengthened the promise she made to
herself, for she knew that she and David would succeed where
others had failed.  She then lumbered out the doorway, on route
to her hut.
	"Good night, Dulcy," her respected comrade called softly to her
as he followed, stopping at the porch.  "And don't allow anyone
to defile your determination.  We will show all of Knothole that
you can land with the best of the dragons, or in this
instructive case, foxes."
	She chuckled, then continued on her way home.

* * *

	The next morning, David woke up at 0800 hours to begin his
preparation for the planetary search for food, raw material, and
habitation areas.  After running the strongly recommended
full-spectrum diagnostic on his major and minor compuorganic
components, he slowly rose from bed and walked to the AVDO
(Audio/Video/Digital/Other) wall unit.  His stealthy subroutines
automatically engaged, for his brother was still peacefully
sleeping the early morning away.  He investigated the final
official reports from the fracas that occurred yesterday and
many of the previous days before, and had his mood set for the
day.  The report told him that, basically, the situation was
worse than he and Sonic anticipated.  Data from the Northern
Freedom Fighter group predicted that the early winter cold front
was advancing faster than the original calculations suggested,
and that the major ground-level supply routes to/from that area
would be impassable in the next seven days.  The tunnels would
still be operative, yet they had a cantankerous habit of
delaying shipments due to cave-ins and other minor geologic
processes seeking a more stable state.  As for Knothole, the
front would arrive in the next eleven days, effectively
arresting all cargo and other transport to/from the area.
	On another note, there were increasing levels of unrest
gradually increasing in Knothole.  This was partially due to the
overcrowding, and to rumors floating around that the food supply
was possibly not of sufficient amount to feed the entire
resident population in the duration of the long winter.
Apparently, the rumor itself was somewhat pervasive, given the
fact that Knothole was literally flooded with people, and a
minuscule (but significant) percentage of them were prone to
gossip broadcasting.  Not very conductive to an already
precarious situation.  Videos of potential rioting in his mind's
eye came forth, a prediction of the near future if the situation
was allowed to conglomerate more and more.
	If David could curse, the appropriate time would be now.  He
held the temptation at bay, not even acknowledging it in the
privacy of his thoughts.  He would not progress all this way to
become notorious for profanity, even if only to himself.  He
combated the undesired emotional response, having the benefit of
a secondary negative feedback system to minimize the properties
of it and transport it to a null data core.  Yet the residual
effects of it still lingered...
	The compuorganic vulpine then downloaded other, more
immediately important, data into his dynamic provisional memory:
 analysis of readiness for the mission that he and Dulcy would
embark on in the next two hours.  He began searching through the
equipment closet for the required supplies for the trip, while
downloading data via a remote low-level RF connection to the
library computer in Rotor's workshop.

	After David was satisfied with the level of data that he felt
would be pertinent to the mission, he quietly exited the hut and
walked toward the workshop that Rotor and Bookshire shared in
their mutual inventive moods.  He had all but one very
significant piece of information, and that didn't serve to
improve the compuorganic fox's attitude.
	'Rotor and Bookshire must be getting progressively more lax in
their database revisions,' he thought as he slowly paced his
trail to the intended target.  'However, I did have the
opportunity to inquire him about the required hardware for the
replicator.  Yet, I did not.  Possibility:  am I becoming more
and more prone to the effects of the past month?'  The answer
was, unfortunately, yes.
	After arriving at the workshop, his sensors penetrated the
metallic mass that comprised the bulk composition of the hut.  A
lone walrus was present, about five meters from David's
location.  David announced his presence by knocking on the main
door.
	The walrus came to the doorway and displaced the metal sheet
that barricaded the exterior environment from entry.  "Well,
David," he said to his comrade, in awe of the situation, "what a
pleasant surprise.  Come right in."
	"Thank you, Rotor," the vulpine replied after he entered the
make-shift technological center.  He then continued in a less
formal and more jovial tone, "It's pleasurable to have the
knowledge that I am still capable of coming here."
	Rotor was a testimony to stress potentials and IR radiation.
"Oh, David," the blue walrus responded, not completely in the
mindset to be cavorting.  "I want you to know that you're always
welcome here.  We've missed you in the past month."
	His dynamic interpreters were not required to give David what
information he needed about Rotor's tone waveform.  Deciding to
bypass the more social preliminaries, he opted for a more severe
vocal resonance, implying the true nature of his presence.
"Excellent.  Rotor, I require your assistance on obtaining data
for the-"
	Interruption from the walrus, who audibly slapped his right paw
on his face.  "Oh, man!  I forgot to tell you yesterday during
the food supply run!"
	Insured that he and his associate were thinking of an identical
subject, he resumed, "We are both at fault.  I had an equal
opportunity to discuss the replicator replacement part
requirements."  Admission of fallibility in this particular case
he felt was the most sensible action to take.  Not intending to
dwell on the subject, he persisted in his diatribe, "Now that I
have the time to do so, what hardware is needed?"
	Rotor then began naming the hardware components, while David
annotated them in his database for future retrieval.

* * *

	Dulcy and David met each other at the bridge at about 0955
hours.  David began explaining the nature of the mission to
Dulcy while assisting her in putting on her ruck sack, but was
interrupted by the sound of Tails' voice bellowing at them.
	"David!  Dulcy!  Wait for me!" as he traversed the distance
between Knothole Center and the bridge by flight.  He reached
his destination four seconds later, panting from the strain.
	"Hi, Tails," greeted the dragon to the breath-depleted fox.
Tails could only wave back in acknowledgment.
	David, however, was not so amicable to his relative's arrival.
He stated in a perplexed tone, "Tails, it's pleasing to see you
here, but it's not necessary."
	"I want to go too, David.  I don't care what Sonic and everyone
else thinks," the red vulpine explained after his lungs regained
the required amount of air to facilitate normal breathing and
speech.
	"Very well-meaning of you, Tails, however..."  He broke off his
explanation, turning his head toward their female companion.
"Dulcy," he asked, "will you please excuse us for a few minutes?"
	"Sure," answered the dragon, baffled by David's treatment of
the situation.  She watched her two comrades walk off to a
secluded area in the Great Forest.
	"David, what's up?" Tails asked when he saw that David was
satisfied with the general security of the location.
	A deep breath from his brother;  not a favorable indication of
what he would say.  "Tails," he began, "I know that you have
been waiting to go with Dulcy for some time, especially since
you were the first-party observer to what Sonic thought of the
idea.  However, I would not recommend it."
	"Why can't I go?" queried the other, saddened and irritated at
the suggestion.
	"I have a mission to perform," David continued, "but more than
that, I have a promise to keep to Dulcy.  She agreed to go on
this mission with me as a surveyor, while I am responsible for
assisting her in landing properly.  Having someone else present
might only serve to aggravate an already precarious atmosphere
for her."
	"Oh," Tails returned in realization, "I see.  Is there anything
I can do to help?"
	"I need someone to monitor the transponder beacon signal.  If
anything unexpected occurs, it's necessary for someone to know
IMMEDIATELY.  And I nominate you for that position."  The black
and gray vulpine waited as his counterpart considered the
significance of the statement.
	"OK, David, I'll make sure that you and Dulcy don't cause any
trouble," Tails finally retorted jovially.
	"Moi?" David retorted back in mock innocence.  "Cause trouble?
What evidence do you have of that proposed history?"
	Tails could only chuckle as he flew off toward their hut.
David regarded his brother with a reverent awe, having the
knowledge that his brother would always try to do the most
sensible thing.  With the most immediate impedance resolved, he
exited from the personal conference area, on a course back
toward Dulcy.
	After he returned to his original position beside Dulcy, his
friend asked, "What was all that about, David?"
	"I regret that I am unable to explain," he initiated with a
grin on his face, "but what transpired falls under the premise
of Security Access Level 4 Alpha.  Access nullified, Dulcy."
	Missing the mark on the intended target, she said, "But I have
Level 4 clearance.  What's the big deal?"
	"Yes," he conceded, "you do have Level 4 access, but NOT the
Alpha Amendment."
	"Well..." the confounded dragon questioned, "who can get the
Alpha Amendment?"
	"Immediate family relatives of the Freedom Fighter Commander in
question," he rejoined, saying nothing further, indicating the
implied privacy he and Tails wished to maintain.
	Dulcy would not obtain any further information concerning the
confidential interaction between the two foxes.  Any further
questioning directed toward or around the subject would be
downloaded to one of David's null data cores.  In his own way,
David would effectively ignore interrogation.  Nothing was more
headstrong than an organic/computer system that had been
programmed (either by the manufacturers, or by itself in David's
case) to answer or not answer an input statement.
	She took the implication, and surrendered to it with
reluctance.  She then ventured the question relative to their
mission, "So, where to?  My wings are itching to fly after being
stuck here with nowhere to go."
	No Alpha Amendment, nor a Level 4 restriction on that question.
 "To the equator," the two-tailed vulpine returned.
	"The equator?!" the adolescent dragon nearly screeched.
"David, do you have any idea how far it is from here to there?
And the heat, we're gonna melt!"
	"No need to concern yourself, Dulcy," he reassured his
distressed comrade.  "The purpose of our presence at the equator
is to enhance my ability to obtain data more uniformly across
the planet.  The process itself will take less than a minute to
perform.  I will personally be responsible for the flights.
They will consist of low-impulse propulsion velocities and warp
engagements."  He picked up her ruck sack from the ground, threw
it over her back, and expertly secured it to her torso.  "What
YOU are required to execute are the LANDINGS.  They will be
under real-time conditions, relative to your organic timebase.
And they will be conducted at all of the suitable sites that I
locate.  I project that you may receive a high degree of
instruction today, so I believe the proper phrase is, 'keep your
wits about you'.  Any questions?"
	No return from Dulcy as she pondered over the mission plans.
She scratched the underside of her muzzle, thinking about the
possible important items that would make a difference between
the success and failure of the undertaking at hand.  She found
nothing lacking in them, since everything had been emphasized
over the course of the past day and now.  As always, David had
explained everything she needed to know.
	"Very well, then," he resumed, noticing that Dulcy had nothing
further to add.  "Our first flight will be a warp engagement to
the equator for the long-range sensor scans, and we will remain
in warp space until the download is complete.  We will then
investigate the favorable areas at a significantly closer range
after the data has completed compilation."  His eyes changed to
a dark blue as a sensor probe emitted from them, looking up and
down the dragon.
	"What's that?" she asked, remotely concerned about the
unpleasant memories of SWATBot targeting sensors resurfacing in
her mind.
	"A mass/volume determinator," he replied, resolving the
computer image of the required graviton warp field geometry in
his warp control computers.  Seeing the puzzled look on her
face, his dynamic interpreter suggested a response to the
implied question.  He informed, "I'll speak to you in detail
about the theories behind graviton warp physics and everything
else involved with my system operations at a later and more
auspicious time.  Right now, we have other labors to complete."
He rotated his rotor/nacelles, and levitated to a midair
position three meters from the ground.  "Dulcy," he instructed
his associate, "follow me."
	The dragon complied with the order, slowly rising from ground
level to a position approximately a meter from David.  She moved
around a few times, attempting to locate herself at the required
point in space where the warp field could easily envelop her
without being critically distorted by an aphasic lobe.  After
she found it, David signaled to her to remain as stable as
possible while he removed the protective shield partitions from
his sensitive graviton field discharge sections on his tails.
He gradually increased the warp field strength, phasing them out
of the known physical universe.
	"David," Dulcy inquired, "how many times have you done this?"
She was concerned that they would both be trapped in warp space
for eternity, if the procedure did not succeed.
	The response from her comrade didn't exactly heighten her
confidence.  "Aside from the simulations in the restructure of
the dynamic graviton warp drive field," David began, "this is my
first attempt."  What made the situation more ill-omened was
that, despite all of David's simulation experience, he didn't
seem very confident in the favorable outcome of the experiment
either.  One-billionth of a degree of critical distortion
outside of the field's reshaping abilities, or a slightly
miscalculated use of power, would be fatal to both of them.  All
the more incentive for David to investigate any and all factors
of concern in the new potential travel method.
	'Oh, boy,' Dulcy thought with resignation.  A new fear of
traveling via FTL threatened to engulf her spirit and her belief
in her comrade's abilities.  She regarded the brightening blue
light emission from David's still-rotating tails.  A sudden stop
to the rotor/nacelles' rotation, then a bright blue flash
encompassed her field of vision as the acceleration into warp
space commenced.  Her eyes instinctively closed at the deafening
influx of visible light.  No time remained for retrospective
analysis for either partner in this real-time experiment;  only
the hope that the procedure would operate well was on their
minds.
	Back in their physical real-time universe, the only indication
of their departure was an intense blue flash that spanned many
kilometers through the Great Forest, and a 35 dB wind shear
noise from the stressed air impacting David's navigational
deflector, dampened only by the precision-geometry differential
graviton fields.  They no longer existed in that point of space
on Mobius.

(nods)  Yeah, he's not all that cute in plush form.  I dunno if I would 
have bought him with my own money, but he was a gift, so I like him.  (:3

(nods)  IMHO, though, the artwork on these 'zoom shots' isn't as good as 
the usual character animation or the artwork in the instruction books.  I 
wonder why that is?  Sonic looks especially bad in his Super/Hyper form 
at the end of S&K...

Okay, lemme see if I can remember them all...

The one I got was the Tails Flying Fox Launcher.  A blue semi-cylindrical 
base with a ripcord attached launches an orange bit of plastic with 
stickers of Tails' snuggable body on both sides into the air, courtesy of 
the helicopter-like 'tails' attachment.  It's a little tricky for us 
southpaws to work, but goes surprisingly high.

They also had, if I remember correctly, a Sonic scooter thing, with a 
launcher to send it flying across the floor; a Knuckles whirling top toy, 
with him holding out his fists like he's imitating the Tazmanian Devil; 
and a Robotnik 'Just Won't Stop' vehicle, which reversed course when it 
bumped into walls and stuff (I don't know how it was powered; possibly a 
flywheel.)

To tell you the truth, I don't have a clue who was ultimately responsible
for getting the graphics to that address.  I was wondering where our pic
of the Happy Fun Fox was from.  There or here?  Hard to say, since there's
no picture credit.

I tried to access the address at about the same time Ratman did.  Holy 
chew slow.  I've seen 8088s go faster than what I was downloading at.
Could be my location, since the UT server here is sometimes deccelerated
sometimes itself.  Or it's something else entirely.

There will be busy periods, and there will be slow periods.  And there 
were several stories posted at the time the slowdown began, so maybe 
quite a few were taking time out to read them.  The list will be here as 
long as we all want it to be.

As for the newsgroup, I normally see about 5-10 posts over a week's time.

Last night I posted JPEGs of both Sonic & Knuckles to 
alt.binaries.pictures.cartoons.

I uploaded those picts to Ratman's Sonic FTP site (sorry, can't remember the 
address off hand).  In addition, I also uploaded two --ahem-- risque Sonic 
pictures done by Doug Winger.  One of Bunny and another of Bunny & Sonic.

Hope you like 'em.

I have put them in the sonic/images dir.
it's:
ftp.mv.com
/pub/users/rat/sonic/images/

and the perverted ones are in /pub/users/rat/sonic/images/perv/ and they are
pretty sick. I don't know why people like that smut. Oh well. If that's what
people want.

Ah yes, B_rabbot.gif and contract.gif right? I wouldn't call them 
risque.  Actually I can think of some other words to use.  They are also 
available at my Web page for everyone's info, as well as a few others.

Just sent two screen grabs of Sonic and Knuckles game to the FTP site.  
The first is of the opening screen with Sonic and Knuckles, just before 
the lettering appears, and the other is of the 'no-way' screen that shows 
Tails, Sonic, Robotnick, and Knuckles.

Uh, yeah, I am.  I'm downloading them right now from his FTP

Being guilty of working at a McDonald's, I can tell you how the toy
promotions work.  I haven't seen these toys myself, but all of our
promotions work in multiples of 4, so you've either listed all the
toys, or there's 4 missing :).

Also, there was one more Sonic McDonald's toy.  Remember the McDonald's
Birthday (or something like that) promotion they had last year.  16 toys,
each from a different past promotion, together forming a train?  Sonic
was on one of those toys as well.

I didn't have any trouble when I lynx'ed it.  Maybe it's a time-of-day issue.

<smirk>
okokok...I can see nobody else has these McDonald's toys (of which
I have SEVERAL of each).  :)
 
The first promotional was FOUR toys.
 
SONIC: The Sonic toy had Sonic on a fireball and you could launch
  him off from it.
TAILS: The Tails toy was a simple handheld launcher with a flat
  picture of tails on a rotary (though four-tailed) tail shaped
  helicopter deal.  :)
KNUCKLES: The Knuckles toy was a whirlwind toy you pushed/pulled
  along a tabletop and watched Knuckles spin as you moved it.
roBUTTnik: The BUTTnik toy looked exactly like the weekday
  syndicated version of ol' BUTTnik on his hover thingy.  When
  it moved, it would bump along walls and move all over the place
  bumping into walls.
 
The SECOND promotional was ONE of twelve different toys McD's had,
but there was only ONE of those twelve related to Sonic.
 
The toy looks exactly like a purple/pinkish television with a
dark purple back end to it.  On top of the television is a black
NEW Sega Genesis console with a 3-button controller. 
 
As you moved the television (which has wheels like a train underneath
and train hitches to attach to the other 12 toys in this series on
both ends of the TV), the picture in the TV shoed a pic of Sonic
running (with a birthday hat on), then shows Tails (also with a B-day
hat on), then shows an angry weekday afternoon syndicated show version
on BUTTnik rchasin' after 'em.  :)
 
 
Anywayz, guys.  Hopes this helps.  I got so many Sonic thingies in
here I don't even remember what to TELL you guys I have.  :)

Spoilers ahead...
[warning warning warning warning warning warning warning warning warning]












Quick Recap of Parts O, I and II
( I call the prelude.. found in a Sonic issue part 0 )

( Part 0 )
While on a mission to destroy an energy substation alone, Sally runs into 
'Former Secret Agent Geoffery St. John' [skunk]'.

( Part I )
St. John joins Sally and her group of 'freedom fighter trainees'.
( Hamlin [pig], Penelope [platypus], Arlo [armadillo], Dylan [porcupine?] )
The plan: Knock out two more energy substations and that 'should' cripple 
Robotnik's defensive net.  The trainees don't like St. John's attitude
(especially Hamlin) but Sally seems to have complete confidence in him.
All six work together to destroy the 2nd substation.

At the end of Part I however... we see St. John wander off while everyone
is asleep...  'teleport' to a laboratory somewhere, and look what appears 
to be a duplicate of Sally in a chamber.

( Part II )
While hang-gliding in to the third substation, Arlo's glider is shot and
he crashes in the trees.  Penelope stays with him while the others go to
the substation.  They succeed in destroying it but find can't find Arlo
or Penelope when they return (no sign of trouble and no tracks)... The go 
back to camp hoping their missing comrades will either be there or will 
somehow show up.  After a few hours there's still no sign of them.

Shortly before dawn, while the others are asleep, St. John takes Sally 
(asleep) with him, swaps her with the other Sally, and contacts Robotnik
telling of his success. 

The next morning, with the 3 substations down and the defenses supposedly
crippled, Sally (the other Sally that is), Hamlin, and Dylan begin their
raid on Robotropolis (Hamlin wonders where St. John is but Sally says he's 
scouting ahead.  Meanwhile, St. John brings Sally (in the container) to 
Robotnik.  Robotnik seems confident the others are falling for his trap.

---

( Part III )

And now for the Conclusion of 'Deadliest of the Species'

Sally, Hamlin, and Dylan are fighting their way into Robotropolis with their
paint-guns and grenades (blinding the SWATBots).  Dylan's believes that
attacking at half-strength isn't wise yet they press on.  Hamlin nearly 
falls from a collapsing catwalk but Sally rescues him.

The eventually reach their objective, break down the doors, and find...
Robotnik, St. John, and Sally (in the container).  Hamlin realizes Geffory
must be a traiter so he jumps him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and 
St. John are on the same side... The jig is up!

Robotnik announces that Sally is an Auto-Automaton (a perfect robot 
duplicate in every way) and that there was NO weakness in the defense 
system.  With the first Auto-Automaton successful his masterplan is to
replace key members of the freedom fighters (i.e. we see Auto-Automatons 
of Sonic and Tails being built)  Robotnik also plans to roboticize Sally 
(the one in the container which St. John brought).

Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber blows up!
A "feedback loop" occurred.  Something which is impossible unless... the
subject is ALREADY a robot.  He tried to robotizice the Auto-Automaton
and the REAL Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin!.

Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but he had a backup plan.  Large 
Stealth'Bots begin coming out of the walls and capture the freedom fighters.
( Its interesting to note that you could see outlines of the Stealth'Bots 
5 pages back when the freedom fighters first entered ).  St. John clicks 
on a remote control and a vehicle burrows its way up from the floor!

Out pop Penelope, Arlo, and three 'moles' from the vehicle.  They help free
Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint-guns).  Robotnik however, manages to
activate a 30 second self-destruct sequence and slides down an escape chute.

With the seconds ticking away, Sally and the others all head to the 
Vehicle Maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air-cars ( from Hangar 18..
haw haw ) and 'Shooom!' out of there with no time to spare.

With everyone back at the base, Sally gives Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo, and Dylan
Battlefield Commissions and promotes them to full-fledged Freedom Fighters.

But.. How did all this happen???   Afterwards Sally explains:

The FIRST 'Sally Switch' occurred right at the beginning of Part I shortly
after meeting St. John.  St. John was really the leader of the 'Rebel 
Underground' and acted as a double agent in order to gain Robotnik's trust 
and activate the robot duplicate prematurely in order to find out what its
plans were.  It was the Auto-Automaton Sally which helped attack the 2nd 
and 3rd substations.  The Auto-Automaton was such a good copy that it gave
orders, made hard choices, and even grieved for missing comrades.  There 
were TWO differences though:

  (1) Robot Sally wore a Purple vest while the real one wore blue.
  (2) Robot Sally referred to St. John as "Geoffrey" while the real
      Sally referred to him as "Mister Saint John".

The SECOND 'Sally Switch' was done in Part II so Robotnik could see it.
Robotnik (as well as most readers) thought that this was the first and 
only switch.

And what about Arlo and Penelope?

They were taken away by the Rebel Underground moles which literally came
up from underground.  St. John's Rebel Underground were also ment to be a 
'Safety Net' in case something unexpected came up.

The story ends with Sally trying to convince Geoffery to come with her to
Knothole.  Geoffery declines the offer because the Rebel Underground still
need him.  He does give her a passionate goodbye kiss though.  (Yo Sonic!  
Watch out!)

-----

This is definitely one of the most complicated story Archie's 'Sonic' group
has ever come up with.  Congrats Archie Crew...  I really enjoyed it!

Not ten minutes ago, I heard, from a friend on America On-line, that he 
apparently knows a reliable source close to who used to be the Producer 
of the SatAM Sonic show. . .

Now to put the debate at rest once and for all...this source said that 
the creatur in the elevator with Snively at the end of"The Doomsday Project"
was.....


















was.............

















was...................Knuckles himself!  I am not kidding!

While the deleted spoiler about who's in the tube with Snively is 
interesting, and also plausible (someone else on the list guessed it), 
this chain of associations is somewhat less than reliable.  Any chance 
you can follow the chain back to the source and get more official 
confirmation thereof?

I'm not at this time.  I don't really expect to have time to really try 
for a while yet.  I did make a trial connection last weekend mostly to 
make sure I could connect.  My software choked on the intro screen, but 
otherwise no problems.  I wish they provided a command prompt character 
(like ">", ".", "%", etc.) so one would know when long text dumps are 
finished.  I couldn't do anything but read news and info, which is more 
or less what I expected.  From what I've seen from the help info, it 
appears that learning my way around there is going to be about as 
challenging as taking on another programming language.

For now, the story I'm co-writing has priority over other 
net.sonic-activities except for the daily care and feeding of this list.  
For when the time comes, I do now know that it is possible for me to 
connect.  BTW, is there any printed documentation for FT?  I'm really 
going to need to RTFM before connecting for real.

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

#23   Jun 1995
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.
Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of the alien spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't entirely clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; also look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel
[c.f., the Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF


SallyGram: Horace Hawkins (14) wishes Sally a Happy Valentine's
Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!


Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: The following represents the positions of neither ABC, Sega
nor DiC, but rather is a recap of scuttlebutt on the Sonic e-mail
group: DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.

Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind

loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.





Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
COMING SOON

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the rest of the
second season.

I don't mind all that much.  This has always struck me as a war of
harassment anyway as opposed to one of serious confrontation.  Didn't
seem all that out of place when I first encountered it in "Sally's
Crusade" from In Your Face #1.

Jim Firmiss identifies Dylan as a "[porcupine?]" so even he hedged his
bets.  With the invocation of Dylan and Arlo, I thought the writers were
going for a 1960's rock stars sort of thing.  Remember, the writing team
of Kanterovich and Penders also named Sally's old teacher Julayla--a
synthesis, I believe, of the titles of two rock songs: "Julia" from the
Beatles' white album, and Eric Clapton's "Layla."

In a sense, you should be glad.  "Hanger 18" is a legendary 1980
pseudo-documentary which one source called the cinematic equivalent of
yellow journalism.  It's supposedly about the "fact" that the US Air Force
has been keeping a crashed UFO under wraps in the aforementioned hanger
while officially denying the existence of UFOs.  Produced by Sunn
Classics (which specialized in the genre with films such as "In Search
of Noah's Ark"), it's a crackpot "What is the secret that our government
is keeping from us?" sort of thing.  Years before "The X-Files" and
light years behind in terms of competence.  If your local video store
has a copy, it might be good for a hoot.

First Bunnie and Antoine, now Sally and Geoffrey -- hmmmm.  They'd
better start creating some new female players before the existing
ones get worn out!  ;-)

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

There are several new images at the ftp site.

I uploaded one file which, at this time, is still pending approval.  
Unless changed, the filename is knuckles_drawing_www.gif.  This file was 
clipped out of a Web page (it was not a link) I found; this was the only 
Sonic-related item on that page.

As a reminder, the ftp site is ftp.mv.com and the directory to cd to is 
/pub/users/rat/sonic.

GAMES
=====
1. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 LCD Game from Tiger Electronics.
2. Sonic the Hedgehog LCD Wrist Game from Tiger Electronics.  This
   was offered in conjunction with some of the video cassettes.  You
   would return proofs of purchase and some cash and then get the game.
   The offer has already expired.  Is this game also sold in stores?
   The packaging makes it appear that it is.
3. AMAZING SONIC THE HEDGEHOG POCKET ARCADE from Sega
   Sonic and Robotnik are at it again!  The diaboloicol Dr. Robotnik has created a
   robot factory and it's up to Sonic to stop the mass production of metal mutants!
   Sonic works his way through the maze-like rooms in an effort to find and remove
   the Emeralds - the factory's only power source. Team up with Sonic through 12
   levels of fast and furious action as he tries to put Robotnik out of business -
   for good!
4. GAME GEAR SONIC 2 SYSTEM from Sega
5. GENESIS SONIC 2 SYSTEM from Sega
6. SONIC CD from Sega
   In his first CD adventure, Sonic goes head to head with The Metal Sonic,
   Dr. Robotnik's head with The Metal Sonic, Dr. Robotnik's evil Hedgehog creation!
   Sonic discovers Robotnik wants all of the Time Stones from The Little Planet so
   he can bend time and rule the world!  Can you help Sonic get them first?
   The CD contains 34 audio selections which can be played on a regular CD player.
7. SONIC CHAOS FOR GAME GEAR from Sega
   Here he comes, straight from his high-speed Sonic 2 adventure!  Headstrong Sonic

   Emeralds. If evil Dr. Robotnik snatches the Emeralds first, he'll make a Super
   Bomb!  Could this be the end?
8. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 LCD Game from Tiger Electronics.

TOYS (NON-GAME)
===============
1. Sonic plush toy.  It's of Sonic, about 12".  From Caltoy.
2. Tails plush toy.  It's of Tails, also about 12".  From Caltoy.
3-6:  McDonald's toys, 1st promotion
        3) SONIC: The Sonic toy had Sonic on a fireball and you could launch
        him off from it.
        4) TAILS: The Tails toy was a simple handheld launcher with a flat
        picture of Tails on a rotary (though four-tailed) tail shaped
        helicopter deal.  :)
        5) KNUCKLES: The Knuckles toy was a whirlwind toy you pushed/pulled
        along a tabletop and watched Knuckles spin as you moved it.
        6) Robotnik: The BUTTnik toy looked exactly like the weekday
        syndicated version of ol' BUTTnik on his hover thingy.  When
        it moved, it would bump along walls and move all over the place
        bumping into walls.
7. McDonald's toy, 2nd promotion.  ONE of twelve different toys McD's had,
   but there was only ONE of those twelve related to Sonic.  The toy looks
   exactly like a purple/pinkish television with a dark purple back end to
   it.  On top of the television is a black NEW Sega Genesis console with a
   3-button controller.

I guess my basic reaction is that it's out of character (show reference: 
after Uncle Chuck's temporarily deroboticized, she tells Sally maybe she 
should "take another look at that man...") _and_ it wasn't really necessary 
to the story line (IMVNSHO).

I don't want to know...

Maybe I deserve that, although Babs Bunny will still be #1 :^)

Actually, I wasn't all that offended, probably because I've seen worse on 
alt.tv.tiny-toon (speaking as a survivor of the great TTBS flamewar...), 
plus I didn't get as attached to Bunnie as I did Babs, plus it had been a 
long day between Good Friday services and pretty much deciding I was fed up 
with my job enough to see if there are any better ones out there (anybody 
need a digital/analog circuit designer? :^)), so I was more or less too 
tired to get upset when I finally got around to reading it last night :^)

>     Hope nobody got too bummed by my allowing Queen Alicia to die.  

Well, it was pretty much expected, but it was still quite sad - especially 
Sally's reaction...  I'll confess I got a bit teary-eyed at it, which 
bothered me because it was yet another reminder that I am moved more by the 
suffering of imaginary characters than I am my fellow man.

>Thanks for putting up with my ramblings.  

And mine :^)  I meant none of the above criticism personally, nor the 
following:  I guess I'm a bit disappointed that with the exception of 
"The Power of Love", all of the fan-fic so far has more or less been on the 
grim side (especially the latest stuff with Packbell).  While I admit I do 
like the dark theme of the Sat. AM show itself, at least most of the 
episodes have enough hope in them that this tempers things a bit.  I don't 
seem to see this in the fan-fic.  But far be it from me to tell people what 
to write - if I decide that it's not worth discussing the comics (that and 
the fan-fic are about all that's left to talk about), I can always 
unsubscribe...

PS to my non-list CCers: if you want a copy of the story, e-mail me -
I still have it for now.  I haven't decided how long or if I'll keep it 
though...

BTW, Happy Easter everybody!  I pray that those of you who don't know 
Christ as your personal Savior will take a moment to consider His claims 
and what He has to offer; also, if you were to die tonight and stand before 
God and He asks you "Why should I let you into My heaven?", what answer 
would you give Him?

To be perfectly honest, I'd have to agree to both parts of the above. If 
anything, Bunnie has a certain affinity for Sonic in the cartoons, which 
she carefully controls since her best friend is Sally....

I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

Only one of the GIFs I'd say you might be offended by, Ron.... (contract.gif)

> >I was sort of afraid that some of her drooling fanboys would take umbrage.

I was bothered, if only that she was taken out of character. There was no 
basis for this in the story up to that point (too sudden)...

> Maybe I deserve that, although Babs Bunny will still be #1 :^)

Yes, Babs is still a far better draw for me, but Bunnie is not very low 
on the list... :)

At least we *tried* keeping the characters in character... (I know what 
we TTBSers did was not to your taste. No apologies are needed for that on 
our part, but we do respect your feelings. That's why .fandom was 
created. Apologies, however, if *that* sounds terse- I'm really not the 
best communicator that I could be...)

Can't help you with your job-seeking, although I'm trying to work on an 
NTSC-PAL video conversion project with Jono Nicholson in the UK...

That means the story's working... :) Seriously, I'll agree with Ron that 
that's what was to be expected. No, wasn't bothered by that at all...

I can really agree with the above: the series had HOPE, and this does 
seem to be lacking in the current crop of stories, even though the 
stories themselves are rather well-written. To those writing: please try 
to work on the "human element", OK? I want to feel more for the 
*characters*, rather than seeing just what the latest plot to foil 
Robotnik is... Also, it's going to be just as much an adventure to 
rebuild Mobius and regain control of the throne....

> PS to my non-list CCers: if you want a copy of the story, e-mail me -

Ron's been bouncing them my way, BTW... Rotor's web site already has the 
stories.... (Hey, Rotor! The site hasn't changed much in the last month, 
except when you added Bloodlines... I know one story has been posted to 
a.f.s-h, but I didn't save it, knowing it would be on the site- I was 
wrong...)

Enjoy Nature's rejuvination, everybody! :)

....Quozl!

Just hope your not trying to start a flame war here =)

Just in case you didn't notice though, in one of the comics, actually two 
of them...it says in the 'Sonic-grams' that Sally is a squirell.  I tend 
to side with this, because I'm sure the people drawing/working on the 
comic KNOW what they are drawing.  Secondly, isn't the name Sally 'ACORN' 
just a bit weird for a fox?  

Also, Tails is much younger than Sally, and his tails are the right size ;)

Just my opinion/comments on the matter.

{grin}  Well... Seeing as how I *work* for Sega and how I'm working *on* a 
new Sonic title, I guess I would know.  :)  Sally is, in no way, a vixen. 
 (Sure, she may be a fox to some, but not a vixen... Anyone understand 
that?)  :-P

You must be stopped.  You and your growing horde.

>Member: Sally is a vixen fan club...all opposition will be crushed.
>Foxes forever!

I'll agree with the "Foxes forever" part, but not that Sally is a vixen.  I 
mean, the one TRUE vixen and certainly foxy female is Disney's Maid Marian. 
 She's one that'll get your blood boiling.  :>

Hey Mike, maybe you can clear this one up for me...I'm still a little 
confused as to what Antoine is supposed to be.  People have been saying 
he is a fox too,  but I find his tail to be just a bit on the short side 
in the comics for him to be a fox.  He looks, (and acts), more like a 
coyote to me.  Just to add to it, King Acorn definately does appear to be 
a fox, although it's never actually been said that he is.  Could this 
just be another 'glich' in the story somewhere?

One of the comics said Antoine gave his Tail to Tails so that Tails would 
have two tails.  I'd say that otherwise he looks like a fox, and more so 
than Sally does.

Greetings!

I just got finished posting those two pictures of Princess Sally that 
were posted to a.b.p.e.c. the other day to my WWW page so now they are 
available for download.

Also, for you "alternative" thinkers out there, my cc.html page is now 
available.  It is not available from my normal homepage so, to access it, 
simply place '/cc.html' at the end of my WWW address.

The second part of "The Experiment" is coming slowly, but, for those of 
you who have been asking, it should be done in about a week or two.

Well, that's all I have to say for now.  Bye!

Unfortunately, I can't clear this up for you.  Antoine, I believe, is a 
character created by either DiC or Archie, and only approved for use by 
Sega.

Unfortunately again, due to the loose grip that our licensing department has 
on Sonic-related characters, numerous glitches can be found in the story. 
 Apparently our character group is trying to get  a better handle on it due 
to Sonic's popularity, but I don't know how or when any sort of 'official' 
documentation will come out regarding the other Freedom Fighters.  I 
currently only have access to character info on Sonic, Tails, Robotnik, 
Knuckles, and Sally.

Ha Ha Ha, "numerous glitches"  -  that's a nice way to put it.

O.K. then:

How do you know Sally is NOT a fox for sure? (if you mention the comic, I'll 
     ignore you)   (and WHO decides these things?)
Why does Tails have 2 tails?
What happened to Robotnik at the end of the last season?
Is Knuckles really the one behind Snively in the elevator scene?
(not that these last 2 quesitons really matter now that the show is cancelled)
Why, if her father is a fox, is Sally not?
What happened to her mother? (seems to follow last question)
Why are there so many inconsistencies between the comic book, T.V. show,
     and books?

Many more questions to follow...

BTW, Mike , would it be possible to share your "character info" with the 'net
freedom fighters?  It might help to limit the stupid questions I keep asking
on this mailing list  ;-)
I think I've set a record!

A recent post prompted me to add my thoughts on the subject...

Mike Wallis writes:

I'm curious about exactly who created Sonic in the first place.
Did Sonic appear anywhere before the Sonic 1 game?

Comparing Sally with the squirrels in my back yard, there is a striking
resemblance, particularly with her face (mouth and nose) and hands.
Ok, so she doesn't have beady eyes and a big, fluffy tail, but then again 
she's a _Mobian_ squirrel, so it's allowed.

> Why does Tails have 2 tails?

How else is a HFF going to fly? 
Since he is a "Two-tailed fox, Mobius variety", that's just normal for him.
What I'd like to know is how he manages to rotate his tails without getting
them wrapped around each other.  It's just magical the way he does that. :-)

> What happened to Robotnik at the end of the last season?

Similar sort of thing as happened at the end of '3 Phases of Eve', I expect.

> Why, if her father is a fox, is Sally not?

Obviously, Mobian genetics are quite different than ours.
Judging by Sally and Sonic's kids in 'The Quest' and 'The Return',
a Mobian species is inherited from the parent of the same gender.
(Their daughter inherited Sonic's faster-than-lightning trait, so
not all characteristics are inherited this way.)
That would suggest that Sally's mother is a squirrel too.

> Why are there so many inconsistencies between the comic book, T.V. show,
> and books?

I invented a "windows on Mobius" theory to deal with this. We have many 
such windows now: each game is one, the SatAM cartoon is one, the 
Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon is another, and all of the 
comics, books, and posters are yet others.  The "glass" in these windows 
acts like lenses, changing the way Mobius is seen through them.

Does Sonic have 3, or 4 fingers on his hands?  It depends on the window 
you're looking through. Each artistic group on Team Sonic creates their 
own window, as does anyone who draws a Freedom Fighter.

Try mailing to Wallis@segaoa.com
it says "user unknown".

He must be having some mondo-serious way-past uncool mail problems (there,
now no one can say this message is off-topic).

Any mail you addressed to the list intending for him to read got bounced
back, so he definatly did not get it. Good thing the messages in the list are
archived, eh? :-)

I'm sure he'll announce his return. So please hold your questions. thanks.

By this logic, what's to prevent her from being a _Mobian_ fox?
(or bear, chipmunk, mouse, dog, etc.....)

Thanx. That explains nothing...

Huh?

Yep, I like this explanation.  That's the same way I look at it -
each is a separate story with the same characters

Yesterday our internet gateway was down, but it appears to be functioning 
today.

I uploaded (to the Sonic FTP site) a picture of Knuckles that I scanned off 
a model sheet.  The file is called knuckmod.jpg and is around 78k.

I also posted it to a.b.p.c

Hi everyone... I had posted this info around 3 weeks ago on 
alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog, and was asked if I could send this to the List, so 
here it is.  :)

 -=-=-=-=-

Okay folks.  Now for a little lesson on Sonic.  :)

But first, a bit of legal stuff.  This information comes from either one of 
two sources:
1) "Sonic the Hedgehog Official Stylebook and Character Manual" (c) 1994 
SEGA
or
2) "Sonic the Hedgehog Bible, August 1991" (c) 1991 SEGA
Both used without permission (oops!).  Footnotes indicate which book the
information came from.  Any spelling errors are my own, unless so denoted
by "sic".  :)

Now on with the session. Here's some information about Sonic's biography,
abilities, attitude, etc.

BIOGRAPHY (book 1)
        Sonic The Hedgehog --- the fastest, coolest hedgehog anywhere.  It's
more than just speed - it's his wit, that won't quit.  He's all heart,
and super smart!  Sonic's always racing from one place to the next ---
barely stopping to catch his breath.
        As Sonic developed his incredible speed, his attitude became
legendary.  This Dude with a 'Tude is irreverent, confident, impatient
and constantly bursting at the quills with energy.  Above all, he's the
bravest big-hearted hedgehog anywhere.
        Sonic's way cool, power red sneakers blast him around at supersonic
speeds without burning through their soles.  Our hero's favorite color
is --- you guessed it:  blue!  He loves gumballs and chili dogs, too, but
he hates water 'cause he can't swim.
        Sonic is always there for his friends --- they know they can count
on him, especially in times of trouble.  It all comes down to loyalty,
and important quality that this hedgehog is full of --- among other
things.
        All Sonic really wants is for life to return to the way it was ---
before Dr. Robotnik took over, polluted the planet and roboticized
everyone.  To free his friends from the Dr.'s grasp, Sonic must trash
Robotnik and his vile eggomatic machine.
        Maybe Sonic will go into a Supersonic Spin Attack --- whatever
happens, watch out.  'Cause the super blue hedgehog is... UP... OVER ---
AND GONE!

MENTAL ABILITIES (book 2)
        Sonic thinks he's perfect, but he's not!  Forest-smart, Sonic is of
average intelligence.  He has to struggle to figure out the solution to a
problem or puzzle.  usually, he relies on his great charm and physical
capabilities to get out of tight spots.  Sonic never analyzes a
situation, he just plunges in.  He's a Hedgehog of Action.

ATTITUDE, PERSONALITY (book 2)
        Carefree and radically cool --- that's what Sonic is all about.
Nothing deep.  That's not to say Sonic is an airhead!  When he's not
teasing you or playing a joke on you, he's probably the best friend you
could ever hope for.  He cares about his forest pals and delights in
coming to their rescue.
        Sonic does not swear, take drugs, harm the environment, or eat
anything that one might consider healthy.  he does make mistakes ---
quite a few of them --- but not without regret.
        Then there's Sonic's Attitude.  When he wants something, he goes for
it --- 150%.  Sonic does not respond well to authority --- he's juat(sic)
too impulsive.  He's cocky, independent, self-assured, but never
obnoxious or cruel.

LIKES, DISLIKES (book 2)
        Sonic loves any thing or any way to move through life at top speed.
His favorite diet?  Fast food and candy bars --- what else!  Sonic loves
burgers, tacos, nachos, fries, anything chocolate, and cola.  Sonic
doesn't eat or drink diet anything --- he needs the calories!  (A note
from me:  it appears Sonic's chili dog fetish developed AFTER the bible
had been printed.)
        One more clue about Sonic's personality --- he's more than a bit
vain about his blue spikes.  His spikes are always perfect.  In Sonic's
world, slobs finish last.
        But when he does slow down, there's nothing Sonic likes more than
exploring new places, playing practical jokes, or playing video games.
        Patience is not one of Sonic's strong points.  When he feels the
pace is too slow, he'll cop his trademark "What's the matter with you,
dude!" attitude and tap his foot with impatience.

OBJECTIVES IN LIFE (book 2)
        Sonic's objectives in life are to have fun and enjoy the ride!  Life
is a blast, if you don't stop to think about it --- that sums up Sonic's
philosophy.  As long as he had his supersonic speed, his sneakers, and
his good buddies, Sonic is one cool and happy dude.

This just occured to me when I was falling asleep, one foot in reality, 
and one in unconciousness....

In season one of the show, Sally was looking for her father. And a quote from
sally was "my father was here!". And she most certainly was no where near the
void. 

In season two, it was made clear that her father was thrown into the void
right after Julian took over. 
Then it was shown that Sally's dad couldn't leave the void without turning to
crystal. 

Did anyone else notice this? I don't read the comic book, so I don't care
about inconsistancies between it and the Sat. AM show. But between the Sat.
AM show and the Sat. AM show? There aren't any other than the one I
meantioned above that I can think of. Of course I don't ever claim that "what
I can think of" is fact.

Well, one could just simply add that to the many other inconsistencies
between the first and second seasons...but how's this:

Remember the scene in "Blast to the Past" where Julian was holding King
Acorn prisoner?  In fact, this was the scene where the King was thrown
into the void.  Now, where did this take place?  It could have been
somewhere in the city, or it could have been Ironlocke.  Since Julian and
King Acorn were not communicating in person, the King by then could have
been taken anywhere by Julian's forces.

Ironlocke is, of course, the valid explanation, and since Julian/Dr. Robotnik
possesses the technology to open up the Void anywhere he wants to, there
you go!  Problem solved.

next... :-)

Good observation, but if you'll recall that same show, Naugus also went
into the void through that same room the King did a year (or so) later...
I kind of doubt Naugus would have selected such a place to enter the
void...but, to each his own!  :-)

Actually, that scene rather confused me.  Why does anyone think Robotnik 
bit the big one?  I mean, Snively saw him getting into an escape pod when 
everything started going foom, and I don't remember seeing that escape 
pod crashing or blowing up or anything...

Good thing, too.  My a.f.s-h distribution is non-existent; all I get are 
stupid 'How to Pick up Women' flames.  In fact, it was only yesterday 
that I got my first Sonic-related information there in weeks...  Anyone

My theory:
   The room from Blast to the Past is most likely some type of a lab where
the void was first developed.  Robotnik (Julian, whatever) captures the king
and holds him in Ironlock(e?) until he's ready to throw the king into the
void.  While he's there, he leaves a message for Sally (or Sandy according to
Daniel Drazen).  Years later, Sally happens to find the message and comes to
the obvious conclusion, "my father was here!"

   First of all, you can't fly with two tails anyway.  Since Tails is a fox,
chances are his tails are not aerodynamically designed for flying.  But let's
say they are, he'd have to rotate them pretty fast to get himself off the
ground.  But let's say he has some special muscle that can do that (like a
hummingbird), his tails would get wrapped around each other.  He could spin
them one way for a while, then when they get caught up, spin them the other
way.  Or  he could spin  one clockwise and one counterclockwise where each
one would go over the other so they don't hit each other.  Problem solved.

Not bad. I wish they would have hinted at that. That's not a bad theory.

Should that be a.b.p.e.c?

Is anybody interested in an ASCII and/or ANSI pic of Sally?  Both were 
posted to the Fidonet Toons echo, and while I didn't think they were that 
great, if anybody wants them I can send them out...

Go ahead and post them.  I think someone did before ask about getting 
other Sonic ASCII art, other than the one that appears at the top of 
faq-dd.  As many of us use VT-100 terminals on the 'net, you might want 
to UUencode any ANSI images so no one's screen will get messed up by the 
different control codes.  This isn't a binaries list, but short, 
infrequent posts of ANSI art shouldn't be much of a problem for anyone here.

For you those of you who can run DOS programs (ie, not to forget OS/2 and 
SoftPC users), I've got two programs that can be used to convert .GIF 
images to ASCII.  Both will require some experimentation with each image 
to get satisfactory results.  Both programs are small, and both are 
free.  If anyone is interested in getting these programs, please let me know.

Run with the Fox
A Sonic the Hedgehog story
by Kris Kelley

This story is protected by copyright laws.  Feel free to distribute this 
story, but the author does not allow any unauthorized alteration of the 
story or distribution for profit.

Part 1.

     Now the season, now the question
     Time to breathe a moment's grace
     For the hunter, and the hunted
     Take the time to break the pace!

     Are you hopeful, are you haunted
     By the Ghost of Christmas Past?
     Face the future undaunted
     Step aside or take your chance!

* * *

     "So you want to be a Freedom Fighter, huh?"
     "Yes.  I do."

     Sonic studied Tolouse, looking him up and down.  Tolouse stood very 
still, not knowing how and if he should move.  Suddenly, Sonic smiled 
and slapped him on the back, surprising Tolouse.
     Sonic laughed.  "I like ya, bud!  I don't know why yet, but I like 
ya!  So, how'd you know about us?"
     That got Tolouse talking, and he spoke rapidly.  "We had a radio, 
and we heard talk, and I decided that I should find you, and---"
     "Whoa, slow down there, bud!" Sonic interrupted.  "Why don't you 
start from a place I can understand.  Like the beginning!"
     Tolouse and Sonic sat down on the forest floor, and Tolouse told as 
best as he could what had happened.  Sonic listened, seeing the fox move 
from tears to anger, hearing his voice move from cracking with sorrow to 
iron-cold with determination.
     Then, the story was over.  Tolouse sat pawing the ground, and Sonic 
looked at him.  Sonic then smiled to himself.  I just know he'd make a 
great Freedom Fighter, he thought.
     Tolouse finally broke the silence with a question he hesitated to 
ask.  "So.  Will you let me join?"
     Sonic stood up.  "Well..."  Sonic wanted to say yes, but he knew he 
better check with a certain someone, first.  He studied Tolouse for a 
second more, and made certain his earlier thoughts.  "C'mon, get up, 
bud!"
     Tolouse got up, a look of hope on his face.
     "Here, you better let me carry you.  We'll get there faster."
     Tolouse look confused.  "Huh?  Faster...?"
     Sonic smirked, holding his hands out.  "You bet!  Come on!"
     Tolouse let Sonic pick him up.  "Where're we going?"
     "Knothole!  Hang on!"  Sonic began building momentum.
     "Hang on?  Hang on to wha---"
     Tolouse's last question changed to a scream in utter surprise and a 
grip for dear life as he experienced his first ride from Sonic the 
Hedgehog.

* * *

     Sally heard a knock, and got up from her seat, setting Nicole down 
on a table.  She opened the door and saw a familiar hedgehog with a 
familiar smirk on his face, and an unfamiliar fox who looked like his 
life had just flashed before his eyes.
     "Hey, Sally!  I've got somebody for you to meet.  This is Tolouse."
     Tolouse caught his breath and nodded politely.  "Hello."
     Sally returned a polite "Hello," and asked Sonic to step inside.  
"Who is he?"
     "I found him in the forest, where he'd been following Bookshire.  
Listen, I think you should talk to him."
     Sally remembered Bookshire's earlier visit, and figured this must 
be the results of Sonic's search.  "Uh-huh," she said, somewhat curious.  
"And why is that?"
     "He wants to join us.  Hear 'im out."  Before Sally could reply, 
Sonic motioned Tolouse inside the hut.  Tolouse stepped in, a little 
nervously.
     "Tolouse, this is Sally," Sonic pretended to clear his throat and 
then said with a deeper voice, "Princess of the House of Acorn!"  Sonic 
chuckled, and Tolouse blinked in astonishment.
     Sally dismissed the grand title.  "Please, Sonic, you know I'm just 
'Sally' here."  Then, she looked at Tolouse, who looked at Sonic as if 
for a cue.
     "Tell her what you told me, Tolouse."  He then walked towards the 
door.  "I'll be runnin' around outside."
     When he closed the door, Sally turned and looked at Tolouse again.  
"So, your name is Tolouse?"
     Tolouse spoke as confidently as he could.  "Yes.  I want to join 
the Freedom Fighters."
     This was not the first time Sally had heard this.  "I see.  Why do 
you wish to join?"
     Tolouse told her the story he had told Sonic earlier that morning.

* * *

     Tolouse paced about in Sonic's hut, wondering what they could be 
saying.  What if they won't let me join? he thought.  They have to!  
They just have to!

     Sonic and Sally continued talking in Sally's hut.  Sonic was 
convinced that Tolouse could help in the cause.  Sally wasn't so sure.
     "Sonic, I sympathize with him completely.  I've lost my father too,  
you know.  But we've got quite a few in Knothole asking to go on 
missions already, and you know we can't just take anybody.  Does he even 
realize what can happen if a mission fails?"
     "I think he does, Sal.  Besides, there aren't many people I know 
that seem as sure about it than he is.  Most of them I already call 
Freedom Fighters!"
     Sally sighed.  "Well, what can he contribute?  You've got speed, 
Bunnie has strength, Antoine---"
     Sonic smirked at the recent addition to the Freedom Fighters.  
"Yeah, why'd we pick him, anyway?"
     Sally sighed.  "He's been here as long as we have, and he's studied 
all the military strategy books and files we could find.  He comes up 
with a good idea every now and then, you know."
     "Sure.  About as often as Rotor cleans his equipment shed!"  Sonic 
snickered at his own joke.  "Too cool, too cool."
     "Sonic, I'm serious.  Every person you and I pick has something to 
give to the cause, and they know what they face.  Are you sure Tolouse 
is up to that?"
     For a rare moment, Sonic became as serious as Sally was.  "Sally, I 
think he is.  But you know something else?  I don't think he's really 
planned for anything else.  Think about it.  He's spent half his life 
thinking about it, and wandered around in the forest for three weeks 
trying to find us.  He'd still be out there if he hadn't've seen 
Bookshire."  Sonic's and Sally's eyes met.  "I'd hate to be the one to 
tell him no."
     Sally sighed, still uncertain.
     "C'mon, Sal!  I'll take responsibility for him."
     Sally couldn't help but laugh.  "Oh you will, hmm?"
     Sonic brightened up.  "You betcha!"
     "That would be a first!"
     "Hey!  So, will you let him?"

* * *

     Tolouse was sitting on Sonic's bed when he heard the door open.  He 
quickly got up and anxiously asked, "So?"
     Sonic looked at Tolouse, his face revealing nothing.  "Sally wants 
to see you again."

Part 2.

     Tolouse walked slowly over to Sally's hut, anxious.  When he got to the 
door, he took one last look at the village that was Knothole.  He sighed and 
said to himself, "When I leave this hut, I'll either be a Freedom Fighter ...or 
I won't ever come back."  Then, just before turning around and knocking on the 
door, he breathed deeply and said, "Well, it won't be because I didn't try.  I 
am *not* going to mess this up!"
     Taking one last deep breath, he knocked on the door.
     "Come in," said a pleasant voice.  He did.
     Sally looked up from where she was seated.  "Tolouse.  Sit down."  He did.
     For a few minutes there was silence, and Tolouse's heart pounded against 
his chest.  But he made himself keep still, and he locked his gaze with 
Sally's.  I am *not* going to mess this up!  Finally, Sally spoke.

[[Author's note:  Tolouse has been sworn to secrecy about the conversation that 
took place between him and Sally.  Therefore, this story has been edited for 
the public.  Sorry :-).]]


     Sally looked at Tolouse once again, and then smiled, very faintly so 
Tolouse would not notice.  Then, she got up and looked out the window.  
"Tolouse, do me a favor.  You must promise not to tell anyone about these 
questions or your answers."
     Tolouse nodded.  "I promise."
     Sally turned back around.  "Can you, on oath as a Freedom Fighter?"
     Tolouse's eyes shot up at her.
     Sally chuckled.  "Well, if you're going to be a Freedom Fighter, prove to 
me that I can trust you like one!"
     Tolouse got up and stood tall.  "Princess Sally, I promise you that I will 
not tell anyone about your questions."
     Sally smiled, and placed her hand on his shoulder.  "Welcome aboard, 
Tolouse."
     Tolouse's mind flew in one thousand different directions at once, and his 
body threatened to do the same, but he held his composure and said, "Thank you, 
Princess."
     Sally chuckled again.  "Please, like I told Sonic, just refer to me as 
'Sally'.  You see, the reason I want you to not say anything is so I can use 
these questions again, with other potential Freedom Fighters.  Understand what 
I mean?"
     Tolouse nodded.  "I do."
     "Good.  Now, do me another favor will you?  Help me play a little joke on 
Sonic."
     Tolouse blinked.  "A joke?"
     Sally giggled.  "Well, even I can have a little fun every once in a while, 
especially where that hedgehog is concerned."  Sally grinned.  "Will you help 
me?"
     "Sure, I guess.  What do I do?"
     "Stay here while I walk out and tell him that I've decided you should not 
be a Freedom Fighter.  Then, I'll let him come in, and you play your part.  
Then we'll spring it on him together!"
     Tolouse thought about it.  "He...won't mind...?"
     Sally giggled again.  "That hedgehog is always playing jokes on people.  
He'll just be getting a dose of his own medicine."
     "Uh, okay.  I can do that."
     Sally smiled.  "Thank you.  Just wait here, okay?" and she was out the 
door.

     Right as the door closed, a loud "YES!!" could have been heard within the 
walls of Sally's hut.

* * *

     "You did, huh?"
     "I am sorry, Sonic, but I think he took it well.  I told him he was 
welcome to stay at Knothole, but I just don't think he's ready to be a Freedom 
Fighter yet."
     Sonic shook his head, but said nothing.
     Sally spoke up.  "Why don't you go and talk to him?  I'm sure he could use 
the company."
     "I guess," Sonic said, and walked towards Sally's hut.  He didn't hear 
Sally's faint giggle coming from behind him.

* * *

     Tolouse looked up as Sonic came in, and did his best to hide his 
excitement.  He got up and pretended to look wistfully out the window.
     "Hey, bud.  Sally, uh, told me."
     "I guess," Tolouse said, making sure to put a note of sadness in his 
voice.
     "C'mon, cheer up, Tolly!  You can stay here, and someday, maybe..."
     Oh, I can't hold on any longer!  But right as Tolouse turned around, Sally 
entered the hut.
     "Gotcha, Sonic," she said, and giggled.
     "Huh?"  Sonic turned to Tolouse, confused.  Tolouse burst out laughing.
     Sonic turned back to Sally, more confused.  "But I thought...hey!  You 
tricked me!"
     "That I did, Sonic," Sally said.  She looked at Tolouse.  "Sonic, meet our 
newest Freedom Fighter."
     Sonic looked at Tolouse, who was beaming with pride.  "All right!!"

* * *

     Later that day, Sonic and Tolouse sat under a tree, talking about 
themselves and listening to the wind rustling the leaves.
     Sonic looked over at Tolouse and smiled.  "You're in, bud."
     Tolouse sighed.  "I'm in."  Tears of joy once again began to well in his 
eyes.
     Sonic couldn't take such a display of emotion.  "Hey, ease up!"  he said.  
Finally, he got up and stretched.  "Come on.  Sally and I are gonna talk to you 
tomorrow about what we do.  But first thing's first.  We gotta get you some 
place to live, and I want ya to meet a few people!"  He thought for a moment, 
then started back towards the village.  "Follow me, I know just where you can 
stay.  Si's old place!"
     Sonic stopped right when the name 'Si' left his lips, and he remembered 
what Sally had warned about failed missions.  He sighed as his mind went back 
to a couple of months ago, when such a mission had resulted in the loss of a 
friend.  "Tolouse?"
     "Yes, Sonic?"
     He studied Tolouse once again.  "This really what you want?"
     Tolouse felt more certain with each passing second.  "Yes, Sonic.  I've 
waited my whole life for this."
     Sonic saw the look of certainty in Tolouse's eyes, and his spirits lifted 
again.  "Well that's good, bud, 'cuz you're gonna be in for quite an adventure!  
Let's go!"

Run with the Fox
A Sonic the Hedgehog Story

Part 3.

One week later.

     Tolouse lay on his bed, thinking about what had occured during the days 
since Sally had told him he was accepted as a Freedom Fighter.  He had been 
told many things.  He had seen how the Freedom Fighters and the rest of the 
villagers lived and worked.  And, he was finding a place for himself...

* * *

     ...A Freedom Fighter leaves no detail unnoticed...

     ...Sonic and Tolouse walked through the forest.  "Remember, Tolouse, use 
your eyes, ears, nose, everything.  But don't start using one so much that you 
ignore all the others.  You're gonna hafta rely on all of them all the time..."

     ..."Found her!"
     Sonic ran up beside him.  "Good work, Tolouse!"
     Sally got up from her hiding place.  "Yes, good work.  Tell me, Tolouse, 
how did you find me?  I was completely hidden from view."
     "I saw where you had stepped on leaves, and then when I was close, I 
noticed your scent."
     Sonic said, "There, you see?  You hafta use all the senses all the time.  
You did great!"
     Tolouse smiled, proud...

     ...A Freedom Fighter does not ignore any possible sign of danger...

     ...Tails jumped.  "Ah!  What is that?"
     Sonic had suggested that Tolouse and Tails spend some time getting to know 
each other.  What Tolouse didn't know was that Sonic and Tails also had a plan 
of their own, and this was another test for Tolouse.
     Tolouse looked in the direction that the noise was coming from, and was a 
little scared himself.  He thought that perhaps it was just a forest animal, 
but his life had taught him never to be too sure of anything.  In his old 
village, everybody would have been underground by now.  
     He looked at Tails, and tried to sound confident.  "Uh...wait here Tails.  
I'll check it out..."
     Tolouse began to cautiously approach the area of the noise...but then he 
stopped himself...

     ...A Freedom Fighter never puts anybody at unnecessary risk...

     ...Wrong answer, Tolouse, he thought to himself.  Looking at Tails again, 
he said, "Come on.  It's probably nothing, but I don't really know.  We'll go 
back and tell the others."
     Suddenly, a blue streak broke out of the forest from where the noise had 
occured, and stopped right in front of Tolouse and Tails.  The streak formed 
itself into Sonic, who stood there smirking.  Tolouse jumped in surprise, and 
Tails giggled.  "Right answer, Tolouse," Sonic said.  "You win again!"
     "So that was...aww, I should've known!"
     Tails piped up, "But you didn't know, Tolouse.  You can't take chances 
when you are with somebody else.  Right, Sonic?"
     Sonic gave Tails a high-five.  "Right, big guy!"
     "Advice that you should follow yourself, Sonic Hedgehog."
     All three turned around to see Sally.
     "Aww, Sal, I never take any chances.  I always know what I'm doing."
     Sally rolled her eyes, and said, chuckling, "Of course you do."
     Tails giggled.  Sonic shrugged and said, "Come on, big guy, race you 
home."
     "Okay, Sonic," and they were off in a blur of legs and tails, while Sally 
and Tolouse decided not to try and keep up as they walked back to the 
village...

     ...Most importantly, a Freedom Fighter stays calm in the face of danger...

     ...Tolouse and Sonic sat in the look-out post the Freedom Fighters had 
constructed near the southern edge of the Great Forest.  Sonic handed a pair of 
binoculars to Tolouse.
     "You see that?"
     Tolouse looked through the binoculars at the horizon.  Through them, the 
city came into detail, and he shivered.  "Yes."
     "Robotropolis, where Ro-butt-nik lives.  Pretty scary just to look at, 
isn't it?"
     "Yeah, it is."
     "Well, you can't stay scared, bud.  Some day you are going to be with us 
on a mission there, and you're gonna hafta make yourself stay unscared.  
Understand?"
     Tolouse looked at the horizon, the city a small dot once again to his un-
aided eyes.  "Yes, I understand."
     "Good.  Now, how do you like it up here?"
     "What, up here in the tree?  It's okay, I guess."
     "Glad you like it!  That's your first mission:  you have sentry duty 
tonight."
     "Huh??"
     Sonic chuckled.  "Like Sally would say, I'm just full of surprises."
     Tolouse look bewildered.  "Uh, tonight?"
     Sonic laughed.  "Don't worry, all you gotta do is stay up and watch.  If 
you see anything bad looking, just use this box to call Sally."  Sonic handed 
Tolouse a com-link.  "Think you'll be okay?"
     "Yeah, I guess.  Just wish I had known a little ahead of time."
     Sonic laughed again.  "I told you you were in for an adventure.  And 
adventures don't keep schedules."  As he started to climb down, he said.  "Oh, 
Tolouse, I'll be back to check up on ya.  Don't fall asleep!"...

* * *

     A knock sounded on Tolouse's door.  When Tolouse opened it, he saw Sonic 
standing there.  "Hi, Sonic.  What's up?"
     Sonic looked him in the eye and said, "We have a mission, bud."

Run with the Fox
A Sonic the Hedgehog Story

Part 4.

     The Freedom Fighters had to choose their missions carefully.  They 
didn't have the supplies nor the people to pursue a war with reckless 
abandon, and because each mission involved a huge amount of risk, they 
had to make sure that what would occur if they were successful was worth 
it.  If they were successful.
     A while back, Bookshire and Rotor had managed to force a link to 
the Robotropolis Main Computer Core, but even with that source of 
information, they had to be cautious.  Packbell, Robotnik's android 
commander, knew of the link, and was constantly planting false 
information in the computer files, hoping to trap the Freedom Fighters.  
It was false information that had led to a failed mission where Bunnie 
was partially roboticized.  That was not something the Freedom Fighters 
wanted to have happen again.
     Now, however, there was enough reliable information to be had, and 
Sally decided it was time for another mission.

     That evening, all who would be involved with the mission were 
gathered in Sally's hut to go over what would take place.  There was 
Sally, Sonic, Bookshire, Bunnie...and Tolouse.
     Sonic and Tolouse were the last ones to appear.  As they stepped 
through the doorway, Tolouse saw the somber expression on everybody's 
face, and he knew it was for real this time.  He sat down in a chair 
offered to him, breathing deeply in an attempt to calm his nerves.  
Sonic sat next to him, and then the room quieted as Sally got up to give 
the details of the mission.
     She set Nicole down on the table and said, "Nicole, display the 
coolant treatment plant."
     The small computer beeped in reply, and soon a holographic 
projection of one of Robotnik's city structures was floating in front of 
the gathering.
     Sally stood beside it.  "According to information Bookshire was 
able to retrieve, all of Robotnik's factories use a coolant system to 
keep the machines from overheating.  However, the coolant formula that 
he uses is very unstable, and must be constantly recycled.  Here," Sally 
pointed to the hologram, "is where that takes place.  If we succeed in 
disabling the treatment plant, all of Robotnik's factories will be off 
line, until he gets the plant repaired or rebuilt.  This means there 
will be less opportunity for him to search for Knothole and other forest 
refugees, which means we have succeeded in buying valuable time."  She 
hesitated before saying softly, "Time that could quite possibly allow us 
to find a way to beat him once and for all."
     She cleared her throat and continued in a normal voice.  "The plant 
follows a schedule.  Every day of the week coolant is brought in from 
different parts of the city for treatment and recycling.  We've found 
out that many of the factories that normally have their coolant recycled 
tomorrow are undergoing reconstruction, so this is our best opportunity 
to disable the plant.
     "Now, here's the plan:  I will see to any security measures that 
need taking care of, and Tolouse will be with me, standing guard and 
helping if necessary.  Once I give an okay, Sonic and Bunnie will go 
inside and plant the explosives.  Any questions?"
     There were none.
     "Okay.  Sonic, Bunnie, I'm sure I don't have to tell you that even 
though the plant won't be as busy as normal, there will still be worker-
bots and Swat-bots all throughout the plant.  Please be careful.  And, 
Tolouse..."  Sally smiled.  "This will be your first time going with us 
to Robotropolis.  Are you ready?"
     Tolouse tried to remember a time when he felt more scared, and he 
did.  He had been four years old, and he and his mother were fleeing 
Mobotropolis.  But, this was what he was here for.  "Yes.  I am."
     Sally nodded.  "Good.  Okay, everybody, try and get some sleep.  
We...have a long day set for tomorrow.  Good night."
     They all got up and gave their polite good-byes.  As Tolouse 
approached the door, he was tapped on the shoulder.  He turned around, 
and saw Sonic.  "Well, bud, this is it.  How ya feelin'?"
     Tolouse was not going to lie.  "Scared as heck."
     Sonic nodded.  "You'd be crazy not to.  Don't worry too much, 
though.  After all," Sonic elbowed Tolouse's side, "you got the *easy* 
part.  Just stand beside Sally and look around."
     Tolouse swallowed, trying not to sound too uncertain.  "Okay.  I'll 
do my best."
     "That's the spirit, bud.  Okay, go home, get some rest.  Big day 
tomorrow."  Sonic waved good night, and Tolouse waved in return.

     Tolouse spent most of the night lieing in bed, wide awake, thinking 
of his mother and the rest of the underground villagers, thinking of his 
new friends at Knothole, and thinking of tomorrow's mission.
     This is it.  Here we go...

* * *

     Early the next morning, the mission began.  Sonic did his usual 
service as transportation, and soon they were all standing in the junk 
yards outside of Robotropolis.  After that, they walked towards the 
treatment plant.  Soon, the plant was towering above them.
     Sally handed Sonic and Bunnie com-links and pointed to the rubble 
of a collapsed building.  "You two hide over there until while I figure 
out a way in.  Tolouse, follow me."
     Sally spent the next few minutes looking over the outside of the 
structure, hoping to find a way in that would allow for the least amount 
of tinkering with the security systems.  Tolouse followed closely, ready 
to do anything he was told.

* * *

     Dr. Ivo Robotnik sat in his command chair, drumming his fingers as 
if he were bored.  Snively, of course, knew better.  Whenever he saw 
Robotnik like this, it was usually soon followed by Robotnik jumping out 
of his chair as if struck by some great inspiration, and soon yet 
another factory or another technologically-wonderful toy or another 
fearce weapon to be used against the Freedom Fighters was being built.  
Well, Snively thought to himself with sarcasm, the old goon will be 
*quite* happy with this latest development.
     "Sir?"
     "What is it, Snively?"
     "I am pleased to report, sir, that the factories you requested 
additions to..."
     "Yes?" Robotnik interrupted, leaning forward.
     "They have been finished ahead of schedule, sir."
     Robotnik stood up, excitement coursing through him.  "That is 
wonderful news, Snively.  Well, get them running!  Establish the links 
to the power generators, the water plants, the coolant plant..."
     "Preparations are being made, sir," said Snively, feeling more 
arrogant with each passing moment.  As if *I* need to be told how to run 
these things...
     "Excellent, Snively," Robotnik said, rubbing his hands together.  
"This is turning out to be a fine day..."  He looked at Snively.  "Well?  
Carry on!"
     "Yes, sir."  Snively turned on his heel and walked out of the room.

* * *

     Tolouse was hiding in the rubble, keeping his eye on the treatment 
plant and the area surrounding it.  Sally had found a way in, and now, 
Sonic and Bunnie were somewhere inside, while Sally stood watch near 
their make-shift entrance.  Provided that all went as planned, the only 
thing left for Tolouse to do was to wait until all three of them 
returned to the rubble.  Of course, it was also his mission to warn them 
should anything approach the plant, even though there was not supposed 
to be activity until later in the day.
     Tolouse yawned and rubbed his eyes.  When he opened them again, 
again, he saw three tankers making their way to the plant.
     "Oh, gods!"
     He quickly pulled out his com-link and said into it, "Guys, there's 
some tankers coming to the plant!  They're coming from the..."  Tolouse 
paused to look around and remember his directions.  He never got a 
chance to decide on the right one.
     "FREEZE, PRISONER!" Tolouse heard a robotic voice say.  He spun 
around and saw a Swat-bot holding a laser rifle to his head.  He froze, 
the com-link slipping out of his hand and clattering on the concrete 
below.
     The Swat-bot called to another bot, and soon Tolouse was being 
escorted to the prison block.
     The com-link left behind came to life.
     "Tolouse, repeat that...Tolouse?...oh gods, Tolouse...?  Bunnie, 
Sonic, abort the mission.  Let's get out of here!"

Part 5.

     "I tell you, I should have gone after him right then!!"
     "Sonic, we had to get out of there!  With those tankers coming in, 
there would not have been any hiding place at all!  There was no time!"
     "Yeah, but..."  Sonic had to finish his sentence with a fist to the 
wall.  He stood, shaking his head, and finally said, "Well, what's to 
stop me from going after him, now?  I've got a power ring.  All I've got 
to do is bust him out of the prison block, right?"
     Sally looked at Bookshire, who sat looking at his computer.  "It 
doesn't look that way, Sonic," he said.  "According to this, Tolouse has 
yet to be entered as a prisoner."
     "What??"
     Bookshire explained.  "Robotnik has a system for keeping track of 
prisoners.  Whenever a 'rebel' is captured, he is taken to the prison 
block, informed that he has been tried for treason and found guilty, and 
then his name is entered into the computer.  Some time after that, he is 
roboticized and sent to work wherever Robotnik 'needs' him.  I'm looking 
at those records now.  Tolouse's name is nowhere to be seen."
     "So what does that mean?  He could still be in the prison block, 
right, and just not typed in?"
     Sally answered.  "That is a possibility, but there is no way to 
guarantee that, and you would spend too much time looking for him.  For 
all we know he could have been," she swallowed, "killed right after he 
called us."
     "Or, he could still be alive hiding somewhere, right?!  I want to 
go look for him!"
     "Sonic, please, listen!"  Sally tried to comfort him, but her voice 
was cracking as well.  "The odds of him being alive and hiding are...not 
enough to justify this.  Right now there is nothing we can do.  But..." 
and she turned to look at Bookshire, "as soon as he finds out anything, 
we will go find him."
     Sonic looked at Sally, but said nothing.  Soon after that, he 
walked slowly out of Bookshire's dwelling.
     Bookshire sighed and said quietly, "Sally, I'll try everywhere.  It 
may take a while, but there are some other files I can try breaking into 
that might help..."
     Sally mouthed a quiet "thank you" and turned to follow Sonic.

* * *

     Some time earlier...

     Packbell paced around Tolouse slowly, calmly repeating his question 
one last time.  "Now, I'll ask once more, and if you answer politely and 
honestly, there may be hope for you.  What were you doing near the 
coolant treatment plant?"
     Tolouse trembled with fear, and he knew that he didn't sound 
convincing, but he wasn't going to betray his friends.  "J-j-just 
walking around."
     Packbell glared at him, a stare that bore deep into Tolouse and 
threatened to make him faint.  "Very well, I guess I will have to---"
     "Packbell!  How is my favorite android today?  I hear we have a new 
prisoner!"
     Packbell cursed silently, and turned to greet Robotnik.  "Good day, 
sir.  I was conducting interrogation of this prisoner."
     "Yes, something that you are quite good at.  However, I have 
something else in mind today.  Take the prisoner to my personal 
transport.  I wish to...have a little talk with him."
     Packbell's basic emotions allowed him to experience surprise and 
utter disbelief.  "Sir?  Perhaps you would be interested in---"
     "Not today, Packbell, not today.  I am in a rare good mood, and I 
intend to make the most of it.  And I think this prisoner can help me."
     Tolouse wasn't sure if he should feel relieved that he was getting 
away from Packbell or even more scared that Robotnik apparently had 
special plans for him.  He was numbly aware of the Swat-bots releasing 
him from the interrogation chair and leading him towards Robotnik's 
vehicle.
     Packbell continued to regard Robotnik with shock.  "Sir, may I ask 
what you have in mind?"
     Robotnik sighed.  "Just a little game I have had in my mind for 
quite some time that I wish to play.  Today is the perfect day for it.  
Well, good day, Commander.  Continue the superb work that you do."
     Packbell had one last thought concerning Robotnik as he watched him 
leave:  "That confounded fool is going to make one mistake too many, 
some day.  I will be there, waiting."

* * *

     It was very seldom that Dr. Ivo Robotnik was in a good mood.  Most 
of the time he was too busy planning some new way to add to the 
monoliths of Robotropolis, or he was finding something to destroy in 
frustration over a defeat at the hands of the Freedom Fighters.  Today, 
however, was different.  The factories that he had ordered rebuilt were 
now finished, a full three days earlier than scheduled, and now it 
appeared that some Freedom Fighter plan had been thwarted, for they had 
managed to capture one of them, and there had been no negative 
consequences.  Yes, today was truly a good day.  And when Robotnik was 
in a good mood, he had the potential to become more evil than even 
Packbell dared to hypothesize.
     It was quite fortunate, he thought to himself now, as he looked 
over the files that he had read and reread so much, that the prisoner 
was a fox.  This made the game that he was about to play that much more 
enjoyable.  "Swat-bots, bring the prisoner in."
     Tolouse was brought into the room, and ordered to take a seat next 
to Robotnik's workstation.
     "Greetings, prisoner.  You know, I think we are going to get to 
know each other very well today, and I would prefer to have something 
else to call you.  What should that be?"
     Tolouse looked at him in fright, but didn't know what else he could 
say.  "T-Tolouse," he stammered.
     "Tolouse.  Pleased to have you in my company...if only for a short 
while."  Robotnik chuckled evilly.  Then, he looked at the text that 
filled the workstation's monitor.  "Tolouse, how familiar are you with 
Mobian history?"
     "I-I'm not...I..."
     "Oh do not worry, I would not kill you simply for that.  Here.  
Allow me to enrich your mind.  Did you know that, according to most 
research, foxes were the first species on Mobius to evolve into sentient 
beings?"
     Tolouse was too scared even to shake his head.  What was going on 
here?
     Robotnik continued.  "This, according to theory, occured nearly 3 
and a half million years ago.  I could go into the fascinating details 
that these files provide for each stage of evolution, but I do not see 
any need to fill your head with such useless information.  However, one 
could begin to think that this is possibly the reason why foxes are the 
most populous of all the species on this planet, don't you think?  
Perhaps this is also why one got to be king of all civilization...if 
only for a few short months."  Robotnik chuckled again, then continued 
with his lecture.  "Now, what I will tell you next intrigues me even 
more.  This same research that says foxes were Mobius's first 
intellegent animals, also says that humans were the last.  Foxes became 
sentient 3 and a half million years ago, and humans only 2 million years 
ago.  Well, that does not seem the fairest thing in the world, now does 
it?  We poor humans seem to have gotten the short end of the 
evolutionary stick!  Perhaps that is why humans like me intend to...make 
up for it, hmm?"  Robotnik laughed and looked at Tolouse, who by now sat 
still with a dazed expression on his face, continuing to prepare for the 
worst, and continuing to see the worst put off by events he could not 
begin to comprehend.
     Robotnik was enjoying himself.  But, he thought to himself, the 
best is yet to come.  He typed in a command, and a new page of text 
appeared on the monitor.  "Now, here is where it gets even more 
fascinating.  During that time when your ancestors were apparently 
intelligent, but mine were not, there was an interesting practice that 
many ancient foxes took part in.  It seems that when a group of foxes 
got together and decided they all wanted some excitement, they would 
find some poor unsuspecting animal, force it to run around while they 
chased it, and then finally corner and kill it.  This was known simply 
as, The Hunt.  And you know what?  More often than not, the animals they 
hunted like this were the direct ancestors of humans!
     "Well, you can imagine how...unfair I thought all this was when I 
first read it.  Imagine, a gang of foxes attacking a single, defenseless 
human.  It makes me want to find some way to justify it all, to avenge 
those ancestors of mine who were wrongfully killed in this manner.  And 
so, Tolouse, with your help, I plan on doing just that.  You will 
represent your ancestors, and I will represent mine, in a new twist on 
the Hunt, which I shall call the Fox-Hunt.  You will be the hunted, and 
I will be the hunter.  Tell me, does this not sound like a great game to 
play, for not only does it pass the time, it also corrects the wrongs 
that out ancestors experienced so long ago.  And..." Robotnik leaned 
forward and gave Tolouse a deep look that Packbell would have been 
impressed with.  "I am sure that you find this much more appealing 
than...the roboticizer."
     Robotnik searched Tolouse's dazed face for a reaction, and finally 
got one.

     Tolouse fainted dead away.

Run with the Fox
A Sonic the Hedgehog Story

Part 6.

     Tolouse was curled up into a ball, paralyzed with fear.  He was in 
Robotnik's private transport, and they were headed towards the Great 
Unknown.
     Robotnik had waited until Tolouse woke up again, and then continued 
to explain his 'game'...

     "...The ancient foxes that played in The Hunt usually relied on 
their nose to find their prey.  Unfortunately, humans cannot smell as 
well as foxes can, and I have yet to master such technology for the 
Swat-bots.  So, just to make this as 'fair' as possible, I have decided 
on this."  He fastened a small device to Tolouse's wrist, locking it.  
"This is a homing signal."  He chuckled.  "Don't worry, dear fox, it is 
not a very powerful one.  I still have to know your general location for 
it to work.  Think of it as my sense of smell.  And...think of this," he 
said, displaying a hover-scooter, "as my legs.  Those ancient foxes 
could run much faster than their poor prey, and I intend on making this 
Fox-Hunt as close to the original as possible."  Robotnik laughed 
loudly, and Tolouse's jaw dropped in grim fear.  His mind screamed, NO!!
     But his voice would not work, and he could only stare at Robotnik 
in helpless, fearful silence...

     Tolouse felt the vehicle slow to a stop, and then he heard Robotnik 
step out.  Soon, the door to the cargo hold slid open, and Tolouse felt 
the afternoon sun.
     "Here we are, Tolouse.  Let the Fox-Hunt begin!"
     A Swat-bot forced Tolouse out of the cargo hold, and he stood on 
the ground, his legs trembling.
     "All right, now.  Off you go, my dear fox."
     Tolouse could only stare, his heart pounding and his mind 
hopelessly confused by panic.
     Robotnik glared at him.  "I am giving you a head start, fox.  USE 
IT!!!"
     Those last words got through, and Tolouse found himself tearing off 
into the Great Unknown, running as fast as he could.
     Robotnik snickered darkly, then, remembering to make this as 'fair' 
and as exciting as possible, put his robotic hand over his eyes.

     "One-Robotropolis, two-Robotropolis, three-Robotropolis..."

* * *

     "Sally!  Sally!  Open up!"  Bookshire pounded on Sally's door.
     Sally finally opened the door, and she looked at the out-of-breath 
raccoon.  "Yes, Bookshire?"
     "I think...I think I found something!" he huffed.  "Robotnik's 
private transport left about a half hour ago, headed towards the Great 
Unknown."
     "Yes?"
     "According to the transport logs, it carried Robotnik, a Swat-bot, 
and a 'nonroboticized fox'!"
     Sally's eyes flew open wide.  "What?  Was it Tolouse?"
     Bookshire shook his head, still breathing hard from running.  "I 
don't know.  It didn't say.  But Sally, whoever it is, they need help!"
     "Right.  Sonic?"  Sally called back into her hut, and Sonic was 
suddenly beside her in the doorway.  "What's up?"
     "Robotnik's in the Great Unknown, and according to Bookshire, he's 
got somebody there!"
     "Who?  Tolouse?"
     "We don't know, but you must find whoever it is before Robotnik 
is... finished with them."
     "Right.  I'm outta here!"
     "Wait!  Do you have a---?"
     They heard Sonic's voice say, "I've got a ring."  But it might have 
been an echo, because by the time they heard the voice, Sonic was 
nowhere to be seen.

* * *

     Oh gods, help me, HELP ME!!!

     Tolouse was badly out of breath, and he was blinded both by the 
spots that danced in his vision and by the tears that were soaking the 
fur of his cheeks.  Still, he kept running, knowing if he didn't, he 
would never run again.

* * *

     Robotnik climbed onto the hover-scooter.

     "It is time to hunt!"

* * *

     Sonic tore through the Great Forest, the trees passing above and 
around him in a brown and green blur.  "I've got to get to the Great 
Unknown!"
     He took out the power ring and held it above his head.  The energy 
coursed through his body, and his mind shouted, "Faster!  Faster!  
FASTER!!"

     BOOM!!!

* * *

     Tolouse felt the energy draining from his body, but he forced 
himself onward.  His mind had ceased all conscious thought several 
minutes ago, but the fear was still there, instinctively telling him to 
run...run...run...

     All around him spread the desolate plains of the Great Unknown.

* * *

     Robotnik began flying wider and wider circles around the 
transport's location, waiting for the tracking device to start 
signalling Tolouse's whereabouts.
     "You cannot hide forever, my dear fox."
     The tracking device began beeping.
     "Ah, good."
     He accelerated the hover-scooter, paying close attention to the 
device.

* * *

     Tolouse collapsed, his body refusing to further.  His chest heaved 
violently, his eyes were no longer working, and his body trembled from 
fear, exhaustion, and the cold, bitter winds of the Great Unknown.

     Why...why?

* * *

     "HEDGEHOG, PRIORITY ONE!  HEDGEHO---"

     The Swat-bot was soon lying in pieces on the ground.
     "Not today, metal-head, I've got a fox to rescue!  Now...where is 
old 'Buttnik, anyways?"
     Sonic picked a direction, and soon was off, leaving Robotnik's 
transport vehicle and the dismantled Swat-bot behind.

* * *

     Tolouse picked himself up, tried to run, and collapsed again about 
20 feet from where he had been.  His mind was trying to spur him on, but 
now there was another voice as well, a less optomistic voice.

     It's over, Tolouse.  You tried...but it's over.

* * *

     The device's beeping increased in frequency.
     "You are close, dear fox, and you are getting closer."
     Robotnik unlatched the laser rifle and held it one hand, his heart 
beating faster as he anticipated the climax of the Fox-Hunt.

     Yes, today is truly one of the best days I have had in a long time.

* * *

     Tolouse refused to listen to that voice, and he tried to get up 
again.  His legs refused to support him.  Denying that fact, he made 
himself run, and managed to stumble forward in a combined run and crawl.

     I don't want to die like this!  I don't want to die...

* * *

     Sonic stood on a small incline, worried.  Robotnik and whoever he 
had brought out here (It's Tolouse, I know it!  It's Tolouse!) were 
nowhere to be seen.
     Suddenly, his eyes made out a small detail, close to the horizon.  
He took out the binoculars from his back-pack.

     "THERE HE IS!!"

     Instantly the incline was abandoned.

* * *

     The device's beeping had virtually turned into a hum, and Robotnik 
began looking around the area.  Soon, his eyes found something, and he 
grinned an evil grin.

     "There he is."

     The hover-scooter changed directions and homed in on what his eyes 
were dead-set on.

* * *

     Tolouse looked behind him, and saw Robotnik approaching.

     It's over, Tolouse...

     No!!  Gods, please, NOOOO!!!!

* * *

     Robotnik stopped the hover-scooter and dismounted.  Slowly, 
methodically, he stepped forward, raising the laser rifle until it was 
aiming at his target.

     "It was a pleasant hunt, dear fox.  And now, the culmination..."

* * *

     "Oh no you don't, 'Buttnik!"

     Sonic didn't waste any time.  He slowed down just enough to be able 
to grab Tolouse, then, again taking out the power ring, he began putting 
as much distance between Tolouse and Robotnik as he could.

* * *

     Robotnik thought his eyes had played a trick on him.  One moment, 
the fox was laying on the ground in front of him, and the next, he was 
gone!  And what was that streak of bl---?

     His mind found the answer before it even completed the question, 
and soon Robotnik was turning bright red in pure, furious anger.

     "NO!!!  YOU...BLASTED...HEDGEHOG!!!"

     After that, he temporarily lost the ability to speak coherently.

* * *

     Tolouse was unconscious in Sonic's arms, and in his dreaming mind, 
Robotnik's rifle was still aimed at his head, frozen in time...

     Those eyes, those piercing, red eyes...

Part 7.

     An ear-splitting scream filled the room.  Sonic, Sally, and 
Bookshire turned around to see Tolouse sitting up, eyes shut tight and 
voice in full volume, in utter terror.
     "Tolouse!  Tolouse!  You're okay, Tolouse!"
     All three crowded around him, trying to stop the violent 
convulsions of his body.
     "Tolouse, calm down!  You're safe!  You're safe!"
     Slowly, agonizingly slowly, Tolouse's trembling ceased, and his 
eyes opened wide with shock.  He looked around, not recognizing 
anything.
     Sonic leaned over.  "Tolouse!  It's me Sonic, your buddy!  Your 
okay, pal!"
     Sonic...Sonic...oh, gods!!
     Tolouse seized Sonic and hugged him tightly, sobbing 
uncontrollably.
     Sally breathed a sigh of relief, and Bookshire nodded.  "He'll be 
okay," he whispered to her.
     Tolouse refused to let Sonic go, and he cried non-stop for the next 
half-hour.

* * *

     Two days later, Tolouse visited Sally's hut for a talk.
     "I am sorry, Tolouse.  I..."  She hesitated.  "I don't know if I 
can say anything that will comfort you.  Everybody at this village has a 
story to tell, about the pain they have suffered and the loss that they 
have experienced at the hands of Robotnik.  Mostly it has been common 
understanding that comforts us.  No words need be spoken."
     Tolouse nodded.  The words were slow in coming out of him as well.  
"I...I have been doing a lot of thinking..."
     "And?"
     Most of the fear had subsided, but uncertainty had taken its place.  
"Since...I got caught and the mission had to be aborted...I was 
wondering...am I still...a Freedom Fighter?"
     "Oh, Tolouse," Sally said gently, shaking her head and smiling.  
"You warned us at the plant when there was danger.  Because of that, 
Sonic and Bunnie were able to get out of the plant before they were 
seen.  I couldn't have asked for a better job from you.  You are an 
honorable Freedom Fighter.  But, Tolouse..."
     Tolouse looked up.
     "Having seen...what you have," she spoke, her voice almost a 
whisper, "I am concerned for you.  Your experiences are very unique, and 
you have seen first-hand just how demented Robotnik is.  I must ask:  Do 
you wish to continue on as a Freedom Fighter?"
     Tolouse sat in silence, thinking.
     Sally nodded.  "You don't have to answer today, and if you say no, 
there isn't a soul in this village who would blame you."
     But Tolouse had already made up his mind.
     He stood up and said in a voice with new-found confidence, "Sally, 
I wish to go on as a Freedom Fighter.  I have dedicated my life to it."
     Sally looked back at him.  "Are you sure?"
     "I am very sure."
     "Very well."  She smiled broadly.  "I did not want to say this 
before I knew for sure, but I am very glad that you will continue with 
us.  You have more than proven yourself to the cause."
     Tolouse exhaled with relief.  "Thank you, Sally."
     "Thank you, Tolouse.  Now go on, scoot.  Make sure Sonic isn't 
making a nuisance of himself somewhere."  She giggled.
     Tolouse smiled, "Okay."

     As he closed the door to her hut, a shiver ran through his body.
     Those eyes, those piercing, red eyes...
     He shook his head, clearing it.  That is in the past now, he told 
himself.  And I am still alive, and I am still going to fight!
     "Y'all 'right, sugar?"
     Tolouse looked up and saw Bunnie standing a few feet away.
     "I'm fine, Bunnie.  I am fine."

* * *

     Let us live to tell our story
     Here on Earth and out in space
     Forward on the road to glory
     History records the chase!

     Across the ice of frozen lakes, run with the fox.
     Along the lanes a lover takes, run with the fox.
     Beneath the moon, a Christmas moon, run with the fox.
     And sing a tune, a lover's tune, run with the fox.
     Across the Bridge of Many Ways, run with the fox.
     Onto the plains where dreamers play, run with the fox.

---The End.

The saga will continue, in "On My Mother's Grave".

I suspect just uploading it from my PC to my VAX and downloading it to the 
UNIX system here at work have messed it up, but tonight I'll try to 
uuencode it and see what happens.  (Anybody know how to view ANSI on a Unix 
system?)

this one. Enjoy!!!

You'll need a termcap file that describes the ANSI terminal type in a way 
that the Unix system can understand.  Then you enter a command to change 
your terminal type to ANSI.  I can poke around this system and one other 
Unix system I have access to, and hopefully I'll find a ANSI termcap.  If 
not, I know two others who use two more Unix systems, and one of those 
might have the termcap.

ANSI and VT-10x are fairly similar, so a ANSI file might be viewable 
anyway, but I'd rather not chance it if I were posting ANSI files here.

Good story!  I really enjoy these fanfic works which keep in tune
with the emotional themes that the show portrayed.  This story
gives a new, horrifying perspective of Robuttnik that is just amazing!
It also had an interresting piece of evolution thrown in...no spoilers here,
just read it!
Can't wait for the next part!

What do you mean "alternative"?  Or have I missed seeing something?

I just read a few messages (flames, really) in my E-mail & 
on the Usenet which I am really unhappy about... This post 
is a response to those messages & E-mails...
I honestly couldn't believe the poor responses I got to this
simple bit 'o creativity.  So to all those who
care: my views on the Princess & why...


What in the name of Mobius is going on here!?!

          The drawing "SALLYFOX.GIF" was a response
to the long running discussion about Princess Sally's
species.  I personally am of the mind-set that she
is a fox, thus, I thought she would look good with a
nice, long tail.  

     Now I know all you comic book fans love to boast
that she is specifically referred to as a "ground squirrel",
but I for one have realized that the show and comic book
have nothing to do with each other!  There are
inconsistencies between the two (discussed at nauseam)
which can only be reconciled if you think of the show,
comic book, (and any other Sonic writing) as separate 
stories with the same basic characters.  Each media is
like looking through different "windows" to Mobius, as 
another 'net Freedom Fighter put it.
     
     With that in mind, Think of the SatAM Sonic show. 
Now, it puzzles me a great deal as to WHY the 
artists/animators/writers would have made Sally's
father a FOX if she herself was not one.  This makes
no logical sense to me.  I think it is fairly obvious 
that SOMEONE on the design team thought Sally was
a fox if they drew her father as one.  

     In response to the realization that Sally's father 
is a fox (on the show) alot of interesting theories 
suddenly popped up: "Her mother was a ground squirrel" 
and "she was adopted" are my personal favorites.  Also, a 
couple of new terms evolved: "Mobian biology" and "cartoon 
genetics" are my favs from that bunch.  All in all, I see 
this as alot of creative B.S. which attempts a rational 
explanation to this dilemma in species.  Of course, since 
there is no hint of species on the show, NO ONE (save maybe 
the artist him/herself) can argue this point.  (and since 
the show was canceled, this will never be resolved.) 

     So put away your torches and flame-throwers and save
them for someone who really deserves it.  As I said, it 
doesn't make any logical sense to me for Sally to be a 
ground squirrel, but to each his own.  I'm done arguing 
this point and can accept that some people still like her
as a ground squirrel.  If you don't like what I drew, erase 
it, but don't bug me about it.  If you disagree with me, 
fine, but realize also that you may be the one who is wrong...

Great story!

The characters were wonderfully portrayed and the story line was very involving.

I look foward to your next story (which I already know a little about from
talking to a certain person on FT)

Hey, Kris, could you send me a complete copy in one mail message?  It would
make it a lot easier for my to post it to my WWW page if I didn't have to do
all the cutting and pasting to the 8 parts you have there.


See ya'!

Will do, and I still promise to get my "Racso" to you as well.  I might
even have some time to do it this evening.  Let us hope :).

>I'm curious as well.  Oh, Miiiiike...  (:3

Sonic was created at Sega of Japan mostly by Hirokazu Yasuhara.  Since then, 
he has come out to Sega of America to work in the STI group on Sonic 2, 
Sonic 3, and Sonic & Knuckles.

So, before the Sonic 1 Sega Genesis game, there was no Sonic.  (Just like 
before "Steamboat Mickey," there was no Mickey Mouse.)

I like the response of Tails having a rotator cuff in his butt.  Hehe...

Sorry about that.

I was under the impression that message was mailed to me personally,
so I blindly "replied" to it.

David, I'm sure you got that :).

Oh, I gotta say it. It was "Steamboat Willie". Mickey came later.

Greetings:

I'm starting to do research for a Sonic apocalypse story (i.e., how
Robotnik is defeated once and for all and everything is put right).  I
find, however, that I'd like as much information as possible on the
Chaos Emeralds and any other Chaos elements in the Sonic story
(...before I go about making up my own  ;-) ).  I know the Chaos
Emeralds figured in the original miniseries but I don't know how.  I
need info on size, properties, origin...in short, ANYTHING!

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

I have uploaded to the ftp site the two .GIF to ASCII converters I said I
have in a previous post.  I originally got both of them from the Graphics
SIG on Delphi (GO MAIN COM GRA), and neither had documentation files. 

Once posted, they will be found at ftp.mv.com, tentatively at 
/pub/users/rat/sonic/pc.  Both programs are for DOS.

Now that the tools are available, maybe we can make some more Sonic (and 
Tails!) ASCII art.  If anyone on the list has TheDraw, why not try some 
ANSI art and ANSI animations?  If no one on the list has it, I can upload 
it too.  (TheDraw is also a DOS program.)

[A request for information on the Chaos Emeralds.]

I can't help you as far as the SatAM series (though I don't think the
Emeralds ever showed up) or the US comic (haven't seen an issue with them
in it), but I *can* tell you about the games, and my own personal theory 
about them...

  ___    In Sonic 1, there were six Chaos Emeralds that could be collected
 / _ \   throughout the game; they came in assorted colors (these colors
/ / \ \  have varied from game to game; if you're interested, I'll make a
\ \_/ /  list) and were shaped something like the ASCII art to the left.
 \___/   Collecting all six didn't do anything special, except for making
         a better end to the game (Sonic throws them into the air, there's
a flash, and all the plants and stuff are de-robotisized).  In the Special
Stage, they were about half as big as Sonic, but in the end sequence
they're shown to be about hand-sized.  (Perhaps the Special Stage distorts
spatial relationships?)

In Sonic 2, there were seven Chaos Emeralds, of the same shape and
size(s), and collecting all seven allowed Sonic to turn into Super Sonic,
a nearly indestructible yellow speed demon.  (Obviously, neither Sonic nor
'Buttnik found the seventh one the first time around.)  Tails was unable 
to harness the Emeralds' power.

In Sonic 3, the Emeralds were pretty much identical to those in Sonic 2 
(the color choices may have been different, I don't know), though Super 
Sonic was powered down a little (made slower, mainly, which is actually 
an advantage; I've never bothered to get all the Emeralds legitimately in 
Sonic 2 because Super Sonic there is too hard to control).  Similarly, in 
Sonic & Knuckles alone there were no changes (though Knuckles now becomes 
Super Knuckles, a flashing pink echidna who climbs faster and runs as 
fast as Sonic usually does).

  ______
 /_/__\_\ In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, the first seven Emeralds are still identical
 \ \  / / to those in Sonic 2, but when the S&K portion of the game is
  \ \/ /  entered, a warp to the Hidden Palace Zone is found.  There, the
   \  /   Chaos Emeralds are 'planted', making giant gray Emeralds that are
    \/    nearly as big as Sonic.  Subsequent forays into the Special Stage 
          uncover the seven Super Emeralds, which in that stage are still
half-Sonic-sized; each one found lights up its counterpart in the 'real
world'.  When all seven are lit, the Master Emerald, an even bigger 
(fully Sonic-sized) green gem, lights up, making Sonic Hyper Sonic (a 
flashing yellow hedgehog who shoots sparks off his body, runs very fast, 
and can kill most enemies on screen at will, not to mention rocket in any 
direction in mid-air), Knuckles Hyper Knuckles (flashes pink with 
afterimages, moves even faster, and can kill enemies by pounding a wall 
and making the screen shake), and Tails Super Tails (flashes white and 
his usual orange, flies faster, runs faster, and is attended by four 
'bluebirds' (who actually match his coloration) that kill enemies on 
their own initiative).

Sonic CD doesn't have Chaos Emeralds, but instead has Time Gems; they 
look the same, but instead of allowing him to become Super Sonic, they 
negate Robotnik's presence in the past of the Little Planet, allowing a 
good ending.  I haven't seen Knuckles Chaotix yet, and don't know 
anything about the Game Gear versions, except that some of them, I'm 
told, have the Emeralds hidden on the level instead of in some special stage.

I hope this was in some way helpful!  (:3

Also, the Chaos Emeralds from Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles were in the 
shape of doedecahedrons. (12 pentagonal sides) This is probably how they 
originally envisioned them, but their graphics werent as good in the 
earlier versions of the game. The 3-d graphics of the latest Sonic's 
special stages allowed them to render the emerald as polyheadral.

That would also explain why he doesn't spin in little circles when he

Does anyone on the list have a really good VCR and video system?  Or 
maybe access to the equipment at their school's Radio/TV department?  If 
someone does and plays a tape of Tails flying and studies it one frame at a
time, some light just might get shed on the subject.  My equipment isn't 
up to the job, so I really don't know what you'll find if anyone decides 
to try this.  If you do try it, don't forget to post your findings here :-)

Who needs a VCR? I've seen the first season enough times (I practically 
wore out my tape) that it's burned into my brain. UNfortunately, the only 
eppisode of the first season where Tails flew, was the one where the art 
looks more like the comic book used to (Heads or Tails, but I'm not sure 
that's the title).
In that epp., Tails kinda hops in the air and hovers toonishly, rear held 
high, as he twists his two tails round each other clockwise, till their 
entwined up to the tip, where he goes helifox and flies off.

The only time I've seen Tails fly on TV was when I happened to catch an 
episode of the weekday show.  In that one, he pretty plainly spins them 
both around in the same direction; however, he also pretty plainly spins 
them in a way that couldn't possibly provide any lift (sort of like the 
box art on Sonic 3).  In the games, his tails are replaced by a 
helicopter-blade-shaped blur.

Maybe it's pixie dust.  We all know the HFF is full of happy thoughts... (:3

The pilot epiosode of "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" (namely "Super 
Special Sonic Search and Smash Squad") shows Tails flying quite clearly.
While flying, he is drawn with 4 tails at 90 degrees to each other, each
tail curving up at the end in an "S" shape, and all tails rotating in a
clockwise direction (as viewed from above).  The drawing in this episode 
is in the unmistakeable style of Scott Shaw!, with the same body-morphing 
technique seen in the Archie comic Sonic mini-series.

Usually, Tails' heli-tails are just drawn as a blur. There is another 
"Adventures" episode ("Tails Prevails"(?)) in which Tails (accidentally) 
starts a cyclone vortex by twirling his tails, which wouldn't happen with 
counter-rotating tails.

Fred,

Thanks for the info.  I haven't encountered the CEs outside of the game,
though the comics (esp. the initial miniseries) might have had something
to say about them.  I figure: if you're going to be apocalyptic, at
least be canonical.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

I accidently deleted all the mailing lists.
But the last backup was last week.

So the list of people on the list might not be current.

Sorry about this guys.

You can see him fly (but not for long) in some of the second-season 
episodes of the Saturday series.  One is just before Dulcy won't let 
Tails see Sonic while Sonic and Sally are doing experiments (the 
de-robiticizer) and they don't want to be disturbed.  Another is when 
Tails gets a power ring so Sonic can get his memory back.  (Did anyone 
notice that when Snively got zapped, his memory loss didn't last nearly 
as long as Sonic's memory loss?)

Sonic had to be shocked with a power ring.
Snivley was shocked out of it by fear. That's my theory.

I noticed the element of fear, but I never considered it as an 
explanation.  I simply thought of that scene as a non sequitor.  That does 
sound reasonable just the same.  One could then expand the theory to 
suggest that any shock of sufficient magnitude would cure the victim's 
memory loss.

We never did see the others return to normal, but we know that they did 
by the next episode.  What would have brought them back to normal?  We'll 
never know the correct answer, but we can always speculate about what 
went on between episodes.

Mike, just a minor correction (but I'm so picky)...
Mickey's first cartoon in 1938 wasn't "Steamboat Mickey" it was
called "Steamboat Willie."
 
This was aan animation that Walt E. Disney and Ub Iwekrs both worked
on.  (Sorry...big Disney archives fanatic...hadda nitpick).  :)

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]


_Sonic_The_Hedgehog_ by Michael Teitelbaum
[Mahwah, NJ]: Troll, 1994

Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.

=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!


Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: The following represents the positions of neither ABC, Sega
nor DiC, but rather is a recap of scuttlebutt on the Sonic e-mail
group: DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.





Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
above), which conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the
rest of the second season.

Sorry to disappoint all you "Sally is a fox" partisans.  Hey, I don't
write'em, I just quote 'em.  And if I DID write 'em, I'd show Sally more
dignity than to call her a "cute little <insert species here> girl."
"Cute" indeed; by age 15 she should be moving away from "cute" and be
halfway towards "stunning!"

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Those were supposed to be spoiler spaces, but you're right, they weren't 
needed.

Well maybe they are, but with all the species confusion, we need one 
concrete answer. Sega? Save us?

"all you" - I thought I wuz the only one...or at least the only one to
admit it.

You mean you quoted this out of the book?  HaHaHaHa...
It's really pathetic that people have tried to argue with ME about this
subject when there are at least 3 different views of this from the "experts"

YES! by age 15,16,17 or whatever you prefer, according to what you read,
'ol Sally girl is definitely growing up...and out...   ;-)~~~~

incidentally, after starting this argument the first, second, and a just 
recent third time on the mailing list, I strongly suggest not wasting 
anymore time with it - NO ONE CAN EVER WIN THE ARGUMENT!!! (NO round 2, o.k.?)
For every instance you say she is a squirrel, I can disprove it with fox, 
another with chipmunk, another with mink, another with..........(get the idea?)

Hey, just because someone grows up (and out, as someone here put it :), 
and starts filling the 'stunning' category, that doesn't disqualify them
from being cute. Although, In Sally's case, 'cute' doesn't really fit..
 
I prefer the term 'waycute'...
 
Maybe even, to paraphrase Blue Boy himself, 'Way Past Cute'... :)
