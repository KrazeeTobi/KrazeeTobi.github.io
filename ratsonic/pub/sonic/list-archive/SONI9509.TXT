Yuppers!  From anywhere, enter: NEXUS and then OUT.
From the West Corner of the Park (WCotP) enter: CAB
In the cab, look at the sign and go to BOINGDRAGON'S GROTTO
When you're there...go to the JUMP ROOM.  In there you'll
find that KNOTHOLE VILLAGE HUB is listed.  GO FOR IT! :)
 
FurryMUCK's Mobius isn't too well developed since all the REAL Sonic
fans go to FurTooniaMUCK instead of Furry. :)
 
FurTooniaMUCK can be reached via telnet -->tel 198.211.131.13 9999
And to be honest... it's a MUCH better MUCK, less lag, less crashes...
and *I'M* always there (the biggest feature of FurToonia)  <snicker>
 
Once you get there, if you wanna get to Knothole...it's REALLY simple...
follow these directions: GOTREE OUT AR RING
That's it!  ...and it's MUCH larger...even The Great Forest is in there.

If you want to send me Email, I would HIGHLY recommend you send it
to either framos@k12.ucs.umass.edu
or to LBQX87A@Prodigy.com
 
Both of those will be read LONG before THIS address would be.

I have converted these icons to OS/2 2.x (and higher) format.  If you use 
OS/2, look in the directory /pub/sonic/os2 at rat.org for these and more

Ok I looked around and tryed to see what I could Leagaly change to make
an ad-on for L.O.R.D. (Legend of the red dragon) to make it into a sonic
like game. All I know of now is just looks and enmies. But I want to
change the level masters and stuff like that. but I'll see.

What I need from YOU!

I don't need to much help. For now all I need is some into ANSIs and a
lot of guys to replace the monsters.  I could have nothing but SWAT-BOTS
but that whould be boring. I wand some minor/major charectors too. I
will have Knuckels as one of the villans but he escapes before you kill
him. And I hope to add some other carectors such as a villan I was
planing for a story and never used. (You'll have to wait to find out).
All I need you to do is send me the below info on your villan. Remember
he/she/it doesn't have to be a major charector in any storys. It can be
someone you made up. Of course I do want premission to use major story
charectors as well. There are about 120 enmies in the whole game. Ok
here's the form.

What I need to know about your charector.

                        There Name:
              Wepon That they use.:
                        Hit Points:
How much gold you get when you win:
   What it says when you kill them
                 with a power move:



And for the ANSIs just send me some good Pictures of any of the
charecors (Make sure to hide your name on it somewhere I won't add it)
All I will ad is the game title.


Thats all I really need.

Here Is what the game changes about L.O.R.D.

 No bard. Insted Sonic and his guitar!
No more Violet. Now guys flirt with Sally.
Visit Rotor's Wepon Shop.
Visit Antone's Armor Shop.
Fight in Robotroplis.
Now insted of a dragon fight robotnik's machien (*I HOPE*)
And the town is Knothole Village.

OK That about cover's it. Any questions just ask!

This project should be finished near the end of the year. I got to work
it into my school day.

Greetings, Sonic fans!
I have an idea for a Sonic game, close to my idea for a lion king 
game that I made.
The lion king game was fun, and now its time for me to create a new 
game!
I've already made the pieces, based off of the pop ups from the 
pocahontas card set,
and boy was robotnik hard.
Now that I have all the characters, (and have had them for some time) 
I need character sheets.
I need some help designing a board game though. Also the character 
sheets.

This is what I would like on a character:

Name: Knuckles
Special abilities: Knuckles,bashing walls, and um....
I'm not really sure, but I know i'll need hit points and stuff like 
that.

Please give some suggestions, or i'll never be able to make this 
game!



Thank you,
Lindsay

Ummm, good luck on replacing the defaults...you're going to need it.  Far
as I know, all you can do with LORD add-ons is add to the original game,
not change it.  I started working on a Sonic IGM (but, admittedly, haven't
gotten very far), and the basic idea is you choose to become good or evil.
Good is harder, but pays off better (as in real life...and Usurper too
<G>).  As a good character, you start out by choosing what kind of animal
you are (each one having different abilities), and as an evil one, you're
stuck with a certain kind of robot and are upgraded when you beat a level.
Anywayz, your idea sounds good, but it seems too hard to pull off to
me...I'd appreciate any help anyone wants to give me.

-> Ummm, good luck on replacing the defaults...you're going to need it.
-> Far as I know, all you can do with LORD add-ons is add to the
-> original game, not change it.  I started working on a Sonic IGM (but,
-> admittedly, haven't gotten very far), and the basic idea is you
-> choose to become good or evil. Good is harder, but pays off better
-> (as in real life...and Usurper too <G>).  As a good character, you
-> start out by choosing what kind of animal you are (each one having
-> different abilities), and as an evil one, you're stuck with a certain
-> kind of robot and are upgraded when you beat a level. Anywayz, your
-> idea sounds good, but it seems too hard to pull off to me...I'd
-> appreciate any help anyone wants to give me.

Not as hard as it sounds. For one to edit the looks of the game you just
change the lordtxt.dat file. and for enmies I got a progame that will
help me do that. I also plan on adding goodsay.dat badsay.dat
normsay.dat to it as well to have coments that you say when you die.

Like say you got killed by knuckels

Fox-King was killed by Knuckels
 "Thats no where near cool!" Fox-King yells as he dies!
or something like that

anyways it's not to hard to do that.

True, I had forgotten that fact.  However, to my knowledge you'd have to
keep the same command letters (i.e. if you changed "King Arthur's Weapons"
to "Rotor's Weapons" you'd still have to type the letter "K" to get in).

By Thad "X" Boyd and Steve "Maxl" Tramer


FOREWORD AND LEGAL STUFF

        This work is written by Thaddeus Boyd and Stephen Tramer.  If you
wish to copy this, fine, but keep it unchanged.  If you use it to make a
quick buck for yourself, we will hunt you down and garrote you (either
that, or prosecute you to the maximum extent of the law).
        The following work is purely fictitious (and if you didn't figure
that out for yourself, you should consult a psychiatrist), except for the
fact that a few characters herein ARE comparable to some real people we
know (with different names, of course).
        I'd like to thank anyone and everyone who has ever written a Sonic
the Hedgehog story, because I draw many ideas from these.  I'd also like to
thank the programmers at Square Soft who created FINAL FANTASY 3, since
I've made a few jokes in this story about that game, as well as taken a
good portion of the opera scene therein.
        Should anything come up in this story that conflicts with any other
Sonic stories -- past, present, or future -- just say that this is an
"alternate reality" and that the events here occurred differently for some reason.

CHAPTER 1
ACCESS DENIED

        CAN'T PROBE TARGET.  The disheartening words flashed across
Nicole's screen.
        "Shoot," Kate said, running a hand through her long, brown hair.
"Even with both of us hooked up to Nicole, Kabuki is still immune to our scanning."
        "I know, Sis," Hedgehog X replied.  "Of course, keep in mind that
we're new to this telepathy thing."
        "Yeah," the fifteen-year-old human girl replied, "but you'd think
that at least MAYBE two of the most powerful entities on the planet would
be able to do SOMETHING!"
        "Don't get down on yuhself, Sugah," Bunnie said to Kate.
"Remember, ah friend here," and with this, she pointed at the unconscious
Siamese cat with probes on her head, "has had a pretty mysterious past."
        "Please," HX said, "don't talk about mysterious pasts around me...I
might start puking."
        Hedgehog X wasn't exaggerating much.  His past had been a major
pain.  After the Life Jades had been stolen from the village of Bluebrook
by Robotnik, a new Gem Child was needed to take the place of Willind, now
called Packbell, who had been the Child of the Jades of Life.
        Without the Jades, creating a new life-form wasn't easy for the
other Power Gems, so the new life-form, who was meant to be a clone of
Mobius's champion, Sonic the Hedgehog, came out wrong.  He was perpetually
eleven years old (the age Sonic had been when he was cloned), as well as
being purple and not having Sonic's speed.
        For these reasons, Xavier -- the name given to the new Child of the
Super Emeralds -- was banished and told to stay away from the Knothole
Freedom Fighters.  However, after he pulled them out of a few scrapes, and
was forced to reveal his true identity, the Emeralds cured his speed
problem and let him join with the Knothole crowd.
        To make matters worse, Xavier -- better known as Hedgehog X -- had
the mind of two beings.  He had once been sent to an odd alternate version
of Mobius, a planet called Terra (known to some as Earth), where his mind
was mixed with that of a sentient -- albeit deceased -- robot named Zero.
With Zero's mind came the ability to become a cyborg -- to be robotic and
yet keep his free will -- a design which Uncle Chuck would no doubt follow,
once the war was over.
        "Let's get back to the task at hand, shall we?" asked Mega Man X
(more commonly known as just "X"), a sentient robot from Earth who was best
friends with Hedgehog X.  "Bookshire, Rotor, how long do you think it'll
take to work this out?"
        "Could be hours," the aging raccoon replied.  "We could use some
help from any of you who know electronics."
        "That'd be me," said X and HX at the same time.
        "Me too," Bunnie spoke up.  "Ah'm kahnda partial to 'em, if y'all
know what Ah mean."
        Sally agreed to help, too, along with a few others.
        "Uh, 'scuse me," a voice said, "but don't you think we should
search Kabook's room for any clues?"
        Everyone in the room looked at Sonic the Hedgehog, the one who had
spoken, stared for a few seconds, and simultaneously hit themselves in the
heads in a "why didn't I think of that?" sort of way.


CHAPTER 2
THE LETTER

        "Kabuki's room is ze peegsty!" came a voice from somewhere under
all the junk.
        "Tell me about it, Ant," Sonic muttered.
        "Why do I have to do this?" came a third voice.
        "To find out what's wrong with Kabuki, Rack," Sonic replied to the
unmistakable voice.
        "Not 'Rack'," the voice replied testily, "Amaroq.  AM-uh-rack
Ka-PYU-jin.  Amaroq Kapugen, meaning 'the great wolf'."
        "Whatever you say, Rack," Sonic replied.
        The black wolf growled angrily.  "Why should we be helping that
cat, anyway?"
        "Any enemy of yours has to be a friend of mine, mon," Knuckles
growled from somewhere in the pile.  Amaroq had a really weird sense of
humor and often insulted his team-members, which made him unpopular with
most of the Freedom Fighters.  "You are a total...HEY!"
        "A total HEY?" Tails wondered.
        "Whuzzap?" Sonic asked.  "Find something?"
        "A letter of some sort," the echidna replied.  "Yecch...it's all greasy."
        "What does it say?" Sonic demanded.
        "The handwriting's awful, Sonic," Knuckles observed, "but I THINK I
can make out what it says:

Deer Cabookee,
        I want you for my bryd.  i'm comInG 4 u.
Uh-oh!  It'z 4 in the Afternon!  I don't kno what that meanz, but I guess
I'yd better stop writhing this letter!
-The WaNDring SyKKo

        "Either that, or something about rabbits and mosquitoes in the cheese."
        "Who's this...wandering...what's-his-name?" Tails asked.
        "You born on a farm, son?" Amaroq asked.
        "I'm not your son," Tails replied, "and please answer my question."
        "Uhhhh...I don't know either," Amaroq replied.  "I just felt like
saying that."
        "Hey," said Sonic, who was now standing behind Knuckles and reading
over his shoulder, "what are those things taped to the letter?"
        "Hmmmm," the echidna said, "they appear to be tickets to see an opera."
        "Ze opera?" Antoine asked, clapping his hands.  "Magnifique!"
        "Since when have there been operas on Mobius?" Tails inquired.
        "Before you were born, mon," Knuckles replied.  "Before that ol'
Robuttnik took over.  The one decent thing he ever did was ban them."
        "Not too great, eh?" asked Tails, rhetorically.
        "You got it," said Amaroq.
        "Sacre bleu!" Antoine cried, outraged.  "Ze operas were ze peak of
ze entertainment!"
        "Hey, guys," Sonic said, "what-say we go talk to the others about this?"
        "Ya, mon," Knuckles said.  "They might have gotten some development
in Kabuki's condition, too, eh?"


CHAPTER 3
DRAWN BLADES

        The grimy badger, clad in a shirt with a strange design, holey
pants, and sandals, kicked the contraption again, then checked his watch.
"I been doin' dis fo' ten minutes now!" he griped in a thick New York accent.
        "Not going too, well, eh ol' buddy?" asked the figure in the dark
suit and hood in a similar voice, without the New York accent.
        "No, it ain't, Tracks," said the badger.  "I never did figure out
how to woik dis t'ingy."
        "Maxl," said the hooded figure, "take it from your buddy, Tracker
-- you're a total klutz when it comes to machines.  Anyways, it's time for
your fencing lesson.  You're getting better."
        "Well, okay," said Maxl, kicking the contraption one last time
before he went into his house to practice fencing with Tracker.  On his way
into the house, Maxl looked at his watch, then mumbled something about
operas and Jade.
        Tracker drew his blade.
"Wow!" said Maxl, "Dat's a good pictcha!"
        "Thanks," said Tracker.  "Your art lessons really helped."
        The two friends were sitting on Maxl's green carpet, the only clean
thing left  in his house.  After fencing with Tracker, Maxl had agreed to
give him an art lesson.
        "Well, since you won that last round of fencing, I want to take you
on again." said Tracker.
        "Deal," answered Maxl, "but you pull your Big Blade and I'll take
ya outta da picture."
        "Fine by me,  just wait and see...." said Tracker, "Just don't snap
your fingers this time, okay?"
        Maxl nodded.  The house floor was all hardwood with no furniture or
mats, except for the green carpet.  For some reason, Maxl just couldn't
stand having any blood on his beautiful carpet.  Some might say that was
the only sane thing about him.
        "TO AHMS!" yelled Maxl across his living room to Tracker.  Both
drew sizable two-foot long daggers.  Tracker advanced on Maxl, the thought
of spilling blood on his mind.  Maxl advanced on Tracker, the thought of
meatloaf on his mind.  Soon, both were in striking distance of each-other.
Maxl decided to try to trick Tracker.
        "HEY!  A big meatloaf's behind ya!" he yelled.
        "Huh??" asked Tracker, looking over his shoulder.  Maxl struck at
Tracker, who pivoted and parried.  Tracker tried the same trick back on
him, which was advantageous.
        "WAIT!" yelled Tracker, "The meatloaf is behind you now!"
        "FOOD!" yelled Maxl.  He spun around, and was stabbed in the back
by Tracker.
        "QUICK!" yelled Tracker.  "Clap your hands!"
        Maxl did so, and got up off of the floor.  He no longer was
bleeding, and the hole where he had been stabbed was gone.
        "Okay," Maxl said, checking his watch.  "We've sparred fo' ten
minutes.  We kin stop now."
        Meanwhile, a robot was watching everything from the underbrush a
few hundred yards away.


CHAPTER 4
KABUKI COMES TO

        ACCESS GRANTED.  The Freedom Fighters cheered as they saw the
message displayed on the screen.
        "Now we need to send the necessary stimulation signal," Bookshire
said.  "Computer, run a low-power electric impulse, similar to brainwaves."
        Kabuki, lying on the floor, gave a slight twitch, but didn't do
anything afterwards.
        "Great," Sally said.  "I guess we've only got one choice left --
shock treatment."
        Amaroq, who had come in a few minutes before, cracked his knuckles.
 "This is gonna be FUN!" he proclaimed.
        Suddenly, there was a high screeching sound -- the sort a cat makes
when stepped on -- and Kabuki was up, claws bared.  "You just try it,
wolf!" she hissed.
        "I could take you on any day of the week," Amaroq replied.
        "Break it up," came a voice, "Or you'll be dealing with ME."  The
voice was exactly the same as X's, but it didn't come from X.
        "X3!" X shouted.
        "In the flesh," X3 replied, "or, rather, the silicon skin alloy."
        Mega Man X3 was an alternate version of X, who had crossed paths
with the Freedom Fighters on a distant planet.  The fact that he existed in
the same reality as X had caused them both to malfunction, so they had
worked hard to become different.  At this point, the weapon systems were
different, and X3 had a strange morphing capability that allowed him to
change shape, but their minds and personalities were still about the same.
        "See anything on your perimeter scan?" Sally asked.
        "As a matter of fact, yes," the robot replied.  "I saw a badger and
a -- a something; I couldn't tell what it was because it was dressed in a
black hood and cloak -- who were fencing in a rather, um, unique way.  They
said something about meatloaf."
        "Get any names?" the princess asked.
        "Yeah.  One of them called himself..."
        "The Wandering Psycho," Kabuki interrupted.
        "Uh, actually, the badger called himself something like Maxwell,
and the shadowy guy said he was the Tracker."
        "Shut up," Kabuki commanded.  "He sent me a note..."
        "This?" Knuckles inquired, and showed everyone the message they'd
found in the heap of stuff.
        "Yeah," Kabuki said.  "It caused me to lose consciousness."
        "Because of its utter stupidity?" Amaroq asked.
        "No," Hedgehog X spoke up.  "Because it triggered something in her
memory that had been somehow blocked out...right, Kabuki?"
        "How did you..."
        "Been there, done that," was the only explanation Hedgehog X gave.
        "Let's just say it's something that you newbies weren't there for,"
X said.  "Newbies" was the term that he used whenever referring to Freedom
Fighters who were new to the business, as opposed to veterans such as Sonic
and Kate, who were there from the start.
        "Nevermind that," Rotor said.  "Kabuki, what can you tell us about
this Maxwell?"
        "To tell you the truth," Kabuki said, "I'd rather SHOW you."  The
jade ring she always wore started glowing, and displayed an image on the
wall.  It was totally black and green, rather like a Game Boy screen, but
no-one seemed to mind.


CHAPTER 5
THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS

        The vision appeared blurry at first, but then slowly began to
resolve, and then sounds started coming up.  Soon, even though it was
green, the Freedom Fighters watching could make out every color through
some enchantment.
        The picture showed a badger, running into a tree repeatedly.
        "Fool!" he screamed in a feminine voice.  "You're...OOF!...going to
get ...OOF!...us all...OOF!...killed!"
        "Lay off!" he said in another voice, male with a New York accent.
"I'm...OOF!...goin' fo' a new...OOF!...record!"  He checked his watch.
        "We've been running...OOF!...into the tree for...OOF!...twenty-five
minutes now!" he said triumphantly, this time using the same male voice,
only without the accent.  "Excellent!"
        The figure of a Siamese cat approached silently from behind.  It
was clearly Kabuki.  "Ummm...what exactly do you think you're doing?" she inquired.
        "Making...OOF!...new...OOF!...records!" the New York accent replied.
        "Stop...OOF!...this at...OOF!...once!" screamed the female voice.
        "We've...OOF!...already made a new...OOF!...record!" the normal
male voice pointed out.
        "Fine.  I'll...OOF!...stop!"  The badger stopped abruptly.
        "I want control of the body next!" the normal male voice said.
        "No!" the female voice replied.  "You'll just do something stupid
like Maxl!  I should have control!"  There was a tremendous argument.
        "Schizophrenia," Kabuki murmured to herself.  "Maybe I should put
the poor thing out of its misery..."  She drew her katana and got ready to
strike, but just before she would have made the killing blow, the ring on
her finger started to glow.
        "What the BLEEP?!" Kabuki gasped (she commonly used the word
"BLEEP" when she felt like swearing).  "It's that gem the fox gave me!
It's...it's POSSESSED!"
        An eerie green glow emanated from the ring, and shone on the
badger.  Its eyes grew big, and the green light grew so bright that no-one
could see a thing.  When their vision was cleared, they saw that there was
no longer one badger, but three.
        One badger looked the same as before, only a bit dirtier, and was
wearing weird clothing.  "What's goin' on?!" he asked in the New York accent.
        "I think...we're...finally...free," contemplated a dark-clad badger
with a hood hanging down from his outfit, in the unaccented male voice.
        "Finally," sighed the female badger, who was not only wearing
green, but whose fur was green to match.  "I've had to put up with running
into trees and other stupid stuff of the like for years now!"
        The green badger contemplated for a moment, then growled, "And it's
YOUR FAULT!"  She struck at the normally-colored badger.
        "Maxl!  Get down!" shouted the dark-clad badger, and threw himself
into Maxl to knock him out of the way.
        "You'll pay for that, Tracker," hissed the green badger, eyes narrowing.
        "No prob, Jade," said Maxl.  "Will you take cash...OR CREDIT?!"
With that, he pulled a credit card out of his pocket, and threw it at Jade,
breaking her fingernail.  "Don't leave home without it," he said.
        Jade screamed in outrage.  "I'LL DESTROY YOU FOR THAT!!!" she shouted.
        "Not so fast!" Kabuki said, leaping in Jade's way.  "Name's Kabuki
Ninomiya.  Normally, I'd sympathize with someone who got their fingernail
broken, but I'm against the slaughter of dumb animals!"
        "Yeah!" Maxl chimed in.  "Hey, WAIT A MINUTE..."
        "We're not dumb!" Tracker said.  "Listen: Two times three
is...umm...six!  Four times eighteen is...umm...NOT six!  So there!"
        "GO!" Kabuki commanded.  "I'll take care of this BLEEP!"
        Tracker and Maxl started running.  "One good turn equals another!"
Tracker said mathematically.  "You've saved us...we'll save you some time
in the future!"
        After checking his watch, Maxl shouted, "Kabuki!  I'll be back for
ya!" and blew her a kiss.  For some reason, a lightning bolt appeared a
second later.
        "Hmmmf...must be a storm brewin'," Jade observed.  "I HATE storms!
They ruin my hair!"
        Kabuki ran after Jade, but the badger turned around and clicked her
tongue.  "You will forget about me," she said.  "In fact, you will forget
about this whole occurrence!"  Kabuki's jade ring glowed again, and Kabuki fainted.
        The vision ended.


CHAPTER 6
BADGER HUNTING

        There was a long period of silence.  Tails was the first to break
it, with one word: "Whoa."
        "That about summarizes it," Kabuki said.  "I was pretty surprised,
too, when I got the letter from one of them."
        "Hence the catatonic stupor," Bookshire finished.
        "Y'know what I think?" Sonic asked rhetorically.
        Just about everyone in the room replied, "Let's go find those badgers!"
        "Let's set up the away team," Sally said.  "We can't have too many
gone, but we need a sizable amount, in case of trouble."
        "I'm going," Kabuki said.  "After all, it's MY past."
        "I'll go," Amaroq said.
        "Count me in," Knuckles said.  "This should be fun!"
        "In that case, I WON'T go," Amaroq said in disgust.  Knuckles was
the one Freedom Fighter who he not only needled, but loathed.
        "I know where they are," X3 said, "so I have to go, too."
        "I'll go," Hedgehog X said.  "After all, I'm a bit of a schizo myself!"
        "Hey!" came Zero's voice.  "Just cuz we've got two minds in one
doesn't make us schizo!"
        "It kinda goes without saying that I'm going," Sonic said.
        "I think I should go," Sally said.  "After all, one level-headed
individual -- or two, depending on how you look at it -- isn't enough.  HX
could use some help in controlling you four.  Besides, I'm the only one
here who can use Nicole...without messing with it, that is."
        "Sounds good to me," said Kate.
        "Have a good time!" X said.
        The group jumped into one of the Warp Rings that were the exit of
the Hidden Palace (where the Freedom Fighters had been living ever since
the destruction of their second Knothole), and found themselves a mere mile
from where the badgers were living.
        They came to where X3 had seen Maxl and Tracker.  The hut was still
there, but the badgers weren't!  All they found was a note on the door:

Deer Cabookee
        Im sory if you came by wile i was goNe.  i'm at the opra, pleez com
joyn me n tRacKer.  uSe the tikkets I gave u.
Luv,
M@)( |_ (the Wandring SyKKo)

        "Yecch," Kabuki muttered.
        "Hey, wait," X3 said.  "There's another note below that!"

Deer Jayd
        This wasnt riten by Maxl, but an eevil fayk Maxl.  Pleas do not pay
any attenshin 2 it!  PLEAS!  Thanx.
Sined,
Not M@)(|_

        "Oh, great," HX muttered.  "Looks like we have to go to an opera
and stop Jade from killing these guys!"
        "No big loss if she does," Sonic commented.
        "C'mon, guys," Kabuki said, "we're going to that opera."
        "But we don't know where it is!" Sally said.  "Maybe the address is
on the tickets...get them out!"
        "Umm...I don't have 'em," Sonic said.
        "Me neither," said HX.
        It turned out everyone had forgotten the tickets.
        "Not to worry," Knuckles said.  He looked at his watch.
        "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'NOT TO WORRY'?!" X3 screeched.  "YOU'RE ACTING
JUST LIKE MAXL!"
        "No I'm not...it's a wrist communicator, mon!" Knuckles explained.
"Knuckles to team!  Come in, team!"
        "What's up?" came a voice through the speaker in his watch.
        "We need transportation," Knuckles explained.
        "What's your location?" came the voice.
        Sally whipped out Nicole and a connector cord, and plugged it into
a small socket in Knuckles' watch.  "I'm sending you our coordinates," she said.
        "Vector, take Mighty and Charmee to the Hidden Palace," Knuckles
said.  "Get ANT 100, and grab those opera tickets!  Send Espio to see if he
can find any badgers."
        "Check," the voice replied.  "This is Vector, out."
        Before the signal died, they faintly heard the voice saying, "See,
Mighty?  I TOLD you my headphones were good for something!"


CHAPTER 7
IN THE GREEN

        Jade glanced at her watch, then looked off the cliff at Mobius'
only remaining opera house, which, for some reason, had not been found by
Robotnik.  So that was where Maxl and that fool Tracker were.
        As far as she was concerned, the schizophrenic Maxl who had created
her could die.  It was his fault that Tracker, who would have made a great
ally otherwise, was so stupid from banging his head into trees so many times.
        Jade wondered what would happen to her if she killed Maxl, but she
didn't care if she died.  She had nothing to live for.
        "Why did you choose an opera house anyway, you fool?" Jade grumbled
to herself.  She checked her watch, then walked away from the edge of the
cliff, and started on her way down the hill to the opera house.
        "Found the opera house," came a whispered voice nearby.  "Found a
green badger, too."  It was quiet, but didn't escape Jade's hearing.
        Jade turned around, but saw nothing.  Whoever she had heard had
somehow disappeared.  "I guess I'm being followed by someone who's pretty
good at the biz," she mused.  "Well, let's see how they like THIS!"
        Jade clicked her heels together, and muttered "There's no place
like home!"  A hideous grin shone on her face, and she disappeared.
        "She teleported!" Espio gasped into his wrist communicator.
        "She can't have gotten far," Kabuki's voice replied.
        "Teleporting takes power," observed X3.
        "Not to mention the fact that, the farther you teleport, the more
your head hurts afterwards!" Hedgehog X put in.
        "Fine," Espio's voice crackled on Knuckles' watch, "I'll check the perimeter."
        "Good," Knuckles said.  "Knuckles out."
        "When do you think the others'll show up?" inquired Sonic,
impatiently.  "Why didn't you just let me run back and get the tickets?"
        "We're not even on the Floating Island anymore, Sonic," Sally
reminded him.  "There's no way you could run back.  As for the time they're
taking, well, you really need to learn some..."
        "THERE IT IS!" X3 shouted.  "ANT 100!"  Sure enough, the silver
ship was quite close on the horizon.
        ANT, the Advanced Neurological Test, had been Rotor and Bookshire's
first test of high-level artificial intelligence.  ANT was created to keep
house, but as Rotor and Bookshire learned more advanced programming, they
upgraded it more.
        As ANT went through many changes, and even did some Freedom
Fighting, he became dubbed by Sonic "ANT 100", and his latest enhancement
allowed him to transform into an aircraft.
        The silver ship landed in front of the small group of Freedom
Fighters, and a door opened.  They walked in.
        "Land about a mile away from the coordinates Espio gave us," Sonic
said.  "We'll get the jump on 'em."


CHAPTER 8
AN EVENING AT THE IMPROV


        "Well," Maxl stated, as he got into the opera house by picking the
lock with one of his credit cards, "I hope Jade was fooled by ah fake note."
        "Me too," said Tracker.   "Even with the Big Blade I'm not ready to
cross her path yet...for some reason I wanna go back to that tree where we
set our record."
        "Which one?  Da tree that gave us brain damage, or da tree dat got
struck by lightnin' foity times?" said Maxl.
        "Weren't those both the same tree?" asked Tracker.
        "Wait!" said Maxl, "I hear sometin'!"
        "Maybe it's the rats....or maybe it's Kabuki.....or maybe it's
Jade!" said Tracker.
        "Nah," said Maxl, "we're too smart fo' her."  he yawned, and a
tornado swept through the theater, avoiding Maxl and Tracker.
        "Hey!  What was that?!" came a distant voice.  "Maxl better not
have learned about his magical powers yet!"
        "It's her!" whispered Maxl to Tracker.  But neither saw anyone.
        "Maybe not," said Tracker, "maybe it was Jade!"
        "Stop bein' so...so...para...para...paraplegic!
No...it's...umm....paranoid!  Yeah!  Dat's it!" said Maxl.
        "Wait!" said Tracker, "I see someone, but it's not Jade."
        "It's her!" squealed Maxl in delight.  "C'mon, let's set up!"
        "Okay, okay," Tracker finally agreed.  He went up into the balcony
to watch Maxl's performance.
        Maxl, the only player in the opera, started singing terribly
off-key.  Tracker clapped his hands over his ears, causing the floor to
turn into a 5-foot-thick pile of Jell-O.
        Maxl, not noticing this development, kept singing.  A few minutes
later, the group of six Freedom Fighters came through the door.
        "Tracker!" X3 exclaimed.
        Tracker nodded his hooded head, then looked at the Siamese cat
glaring at him.  "Ah!  Kabuki!  We've been expecting you!  Please sit down!"
        "I'm not about to sit with the likes of..."
        Tracker belched, causing the entire group of Freedom Fighters to
plop down in the seats.
        Maxl was on a very dramatic scene at this point.  Of course,
playing all the characters made it seem more humorous than dramatic.
        Maxl, dressed as a woman, sang "Dra-a-co, I've waited so long.  I
knew you'd come!"
        Maxl tossed off the woman's outfit, revealing a masculine outfit
underneath.  He sang something about marrying Maria.
        Then came the duel, which was incredibly difficult to be done with
one player.  He'd toss off one outfit, showing the next underneath, and
jump to one side, then strike, then change outfits and jump back.
        "This is TERRIBLE," remarked Sonic.
        "Hasn't changed a bit," Sally muttered.
        Amaroq said nothing, but looked around for an airsickness bag.
        Suddenly, Tracker screamed.  "JADE!"  He pointed at the rafters
above them.  Jade was standing there, about to push a four-ton weight on
Maxl's head.


CHAPTER 9
A WEIGHTY DECISION

        Tracker bolted for the door, and before anyone could stop him, he
was gone.
        Jade, meanwhile, looked at her watch.  "ARGH!" she said in
frustration.  "It's gonna take five minutes to drop this thing!"
        "We've got to stop her!" Kabuki shouted.  "I'll go after her!"
        "I'm comin, too," X3 growled, then turned into a tiger.
        "Fine," Kabuki said.  "Let's go!"
        They ran into the next room, and tried to enter the door to the
rafters, but it was locked.  "BLEEP!" she shouted.  "X3...can't you do
something?"  One thing about Kabuki was that she knew absolutely nothing
about the capabilities of X and X3.
        "The unlocking mechanism is probably in another room," X3 observed.
 "I'll tell the others to check it out."
        "We can't get through," crackled the voice on Knuckles' watch.
"Take the door to your right!"
        "Check," Sally said.  "C'mon."  She and the other three ran to the
next room.  "Four switches...let's each pull one."
        Knuckles pulled his.  The sound of a dog barking was heard.  "Wrong
switch, mon," he said.
        Sonic pulled his, and the lights went out.  After turning them back
on, he said, "Light switch."
        Hedgehog X pulled his switch.  A hole appeared beneath his feet,
and he fell onto the stage.
        "I guess that leaves this one," Sally said.  She pulled it.  "It
should be open," she said into Knuckles' watch.
        "It is," X3's voice replied.  "Let's go!"
        "We'll be on stage," Sonic said, and the three jumped down the hole.
        Kabuki and X3 walked on the rafters.  Every so often, some small
rats would bother them, but were quickly disposed of...remember, Kabuki's a
cat, and X3 was in tiger form.
        Finally, they reached Jade, who grinned, satisfied.  "Nice try, but
I've already pushed the weight far enough!"  It was true...the weight was
clearly about to fall.
        "NOT SO FAST!" shouted a voice.  Espio suddenly appeared, and
jumped on Jade's head.  The chameleon covered Jade's eyes, and while she
moved about wildly, Kabuki drew her katana, and threw it at Jade's neck.
Espio jumped off Jade's head and clung to the wall.
        The blade never reached its mark, because suddenly, all the strain
on the rafter they were fighting on caused it to give.  Everything fell:
Jade, Kabuki, X3, the katana...and the weight.
        "Looks like it's that time again," muttered Hedgehog X, who was
always bearing the brunt of attacks.  He ran to where the weight was
landing, pushed Maxl out of the way, and caught it.  The velocity caused
him to fall through the Jell-O floor...and several hard-wood floors, too.
He ended up in the third basement.
         Jade looked at her watch.  "Five minutes, exactly," she said
satisfactorily.  Then, she saw Maxl, oblivious to what was going on around
him.  She caught Kabuki's katana as it fell, and went up behind Maxl.  She
got into the proper stance to make a killing blow.


CHAPTER 10
THE BATTLE

        BLAM!  The opera house wall to Jade's left exploded.  A voice
shouted, as Jade was beginning the swing, "Maxl!  Your shoes are untied!"
        Maxl bent down to examine his shoes.  Jade swung over his head, and
the force of the swing caused her to trip over him and land the katana in
the wall.
        Jade glared angrily at the one who had spoken -- Amaroq.  "Stupid,
interfering wolf!" she said hatefully.  "You've just sealed your fate!"
        Amaroq threw back his head and laughed.
        "Jade?" Maxl said, and looked up.  "How did ya follow me?  I'll
kill ya...just as soon as I'm done figurin' out how to tie my shoes!"
        "Whoa," Amaroq said, "what kind of shampoo do you use, Valvoline or
Q-Lube?"
        "Pennzoil," Maxl replied, and looked back down at his sandals.
        Jade advanced on Amaroq, ready to strike.  Suddenly, she was kicked
from behind, knocking her down.
        Kabuki smiled.  "Had enough, witch?" she asked.
        "Not quite," Jade replied.  She grinned, and Kabuki's ring started
to glow.  Kabuki disappeared.  "Who's next?" Jade asked.
        "That would be me," Amaroq replied.  He activated his
super-powerful Initiation 27 to defeat Jade.  However, Jade crossed her
eyes and phased, so all the Initiation 27 succeeded in doing was destroying
the Jell-O floor, causing everyone to fall to the first basement.
        "I'll deal with you later," Amaroq growled, "when I regenerate.
For now, well..."  He whistled, and a bunch of other Freedom Fighters appeared.
        "What's going on?!" Sonic asked.
        "We had Dulcy follow ANT 100," Amaroq explained, "A few of us rode
her, and the rest followed, some on foot and some in the biplane."
        While Jade was distracted, X3 attacked her from behind, grabbing
her arm in his mouth.  X appeared, and powered-up his X-Buster to destroy her.
        Jade's arm suddenly turned white.  It singed X3's mouth, causing
him to revert to his normal form.  X fired, but Jade dodged.
        Sonic tried to spin-dash Jade from one end; Knuckles from the
other.  Jade jumped, and they hit each-other, knocking themselves out.
        "Hmmm," Maxl said to himself.  "Good ting I brought dis
duct-tape..."  He wrapped the tape around his sandals.  "Dat's bettah!"
        Jade ran, but was tripped by Sally, and flew into Bunnie's arms.
Bunnie held Jade, as Rotor appeared with his trusty cattle-prod.
        "Enough!" Jade shouted.  She clicked her heels together, and said,
"There's no place like home!"  She, Bunnie, and Maxl all disappeared.
        "They've teleported!" X exclaimed.
        "Well, then, let's find 'em!" Amaroq growled.
        "Check," X said.  "We'll split into groups of two.  I'll go with
Tails, and check the surrounding areas."  He climbed the wall back up to
what used to be the first floor, and went to the opening.
        "I'll get Dulcy," Sally said.  "We'll see if Jade's in any trees."
        "I'll take you out, Aunt Sally," Tails said.  He flew up to the
opening, holding Sally's hands.  He let her go outside, then followed X.
        "I'll stay here and tend to the unconscious ones," Rotor said diligently.
        "I should stay here, too," X3 said.  "I'm still in some pain."
        "Much as I hate to admit it," Amaroq said, "I can't really do much
at this point.  Using Initiation 27 wore me out."
        "I weel stay too," Antoine said.
        "I'll pair up with Xavi..." Kate broke off in the middle of her
sentence.  "Say...where IS Xavier?"


CHAPTER 11
GOING DOWN

        "I haven't seen him since he left!" Rotor exclaimed.
        "I'll find him," Kate said.  A faint glow surrounded her.
Suddenly, she exclaimed, "He went this way!"
        She dove down the hole Hedgehog X and the weight had made (which
had somehow gone unnoticed through the whole battle) head-first.
        "I'm goin' after her," Amaroq said with determination.  With a
whoop, he jumped in after her, forgetting that he was supposed to be resting.
        They fell a few floors, then found their target.  Kate, using the
power of the Chaos Emeralds, and Amaroq, using the Moon Gems, stopped and
floated in mid-air, listening.
        "Oh, what the who-ha happened?" came a groggy voice.
        Jade checked her watch.  "You've been unconscious for 7 minutes,
rabbit," she observed.  "I liked you better that way.  I don't want to risk
having you grab me again, so I guess I'll just put up a barrier around
me...and Maxl!"
        Bunnie, whose head had cleared, rushed toward Jade.  She ran to a
spot a few feet away from the badgers, and bounced back to her original position.
        "No use," Kabuki said grimly.  "Looks like our only choice is to
stand here and watch."
        "Exactly!" Jade said gleefully.
        "THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!"  The cry came from three voices: Amaroq
and Kate, as well as a hedgehog who had been hidden in the shadows.
        Using their combined powers, the three sapped away Jade's
force-field's energy in a nanosecond.
        "Jig's up," Amaroq growled.
        "Give yourself up," Kate said, "if you value your existence."
        Bunnie opened her mouth to say something, but in a quick movement,
Jade reached for her boot.
        "Maxl!  Move it!" Hedgehog X shouted.  "She's got a..."
        "Knife," Jade finished for him, pressing the steel against Maxl's
neck.  "Now, you shall all watch as I kill him!"
        "Wait a minute!" Kabuki said.  "You, him, and Tracker are all
connected...if you kill him, you'll kill yourself!"
        "That's possible," Jade acknowledged, "but frankly, I just don't
care!"  She turned to Maxl.  "Any last requests, weakling?"
        "Ummm, yeah," Maxl said.  "Got any meatloaf?"
        "No," Jade replied.  "Anything else?"
        "Well...my allergies have really been botherin' me lately," Maxl
said.  "Mind if I blow my nose?"
        "You could use it," Jade acknowledged.  "All right, here's a hank
-- EWWW!"
        Maxl had blown his nose all over the sleeve of his dirty shirt.
The others in the room were all grimacing.
        "Why, you disgusting little..." Jade suddenly broke off and started
screaming.  Her appearance started to distort, so that her face looked like
it was being pressed against a glass door, and the rest of her was
beginning to dissolve.  Within seconds, she wasn't there anymore.
        For some time, no-one spoke.  Finally, Maxl was the one to break
the silence.  "Whoa," he gasped.
        "I second that," HX replied.
        "Looks like my nasal discharge somehow displaced Jade into another
dimension," Maxl mused, stroking the hair on his chin tentatively.
        The others gaped.
        "How did you suddenly get so SMART?!" Amaroq asked.
        "And what the who-ha happened to yo' funny accent?" Bunnie wondered.
        "If I may answer both questions at once," Maxl said, "Jade's very
existence in the same world as I am causes me to go berserk.  Luckily, now
that she's gone, I'm back to my normal self."
        "Not the comic relief anymore, eh?" came a voice from above.  The
group looked up through the hole in the ceiling and saw X peering down at
them.  "Let's get back to the Hidden Palace," he said.


CHAPTER 12
HOME AGAIN

        "Interesting story," Bookshire said.  As usual, he had stayed
behind and monitored the others.  Between his age and his weak right leg,
one could say battle was not Bookshire Draftwood's strong suit.
        "You sound like you would be a very worthy asset," Sally said to
Maxl.  "Will you join the Freedom Fighters?"
        "Well," Maxl said, "the thing is, I don't really know how to use my
powers all that well.  I think it's best that I learn some more about them
before I join you for good, so that I don't end up setting any of you on
fire or anything."
        X nodded.  "Understandable.  However, I'd like to keep in touch, if
possible."
        "Sure," Maxl said.  "Uhhh, how?"
        "Let me see your watch for a bit," Rotor said.
        "Planning on installing a wrist communicator?" Maxl inquired.
        "Mmm-hmm," Rotor replied, taking the watch.  He grabbed some parts
and tinkered with them for a few minutes, and handed Maxl his watch back,
this time with a small microphone and speaker installed.
        "Thanks," Maxl said, grinning.  "Also, do you have any clean shirts
or shorts?"  He pointed down at his garments, which were covered in dust,
grime, and all sorts of stuff that I can't describe and you wouldn't want
to hear about anyway.
        "Well," Sally said, "I've got a spare vest..."
        "Okay," Maxl replied.
        "I have ze whole wardrobe," Antoine spoke up.
        "I guess I'll check that out too," Maxl said, trying to be polite.
He and Antoine walked off, and Sally went to get her spare vest.
        Maxl came out a few minutes later in a uniform like Antoine's.
"Well, it's an improvement over what I had before," he said.  He looked
down at the scabbard in the belt Antoine had given him.  "Hmmm," he
muttered, "I don't have anything to put in here..."
        "Take a katana," Kabuki said.  She handed him the blade she'd been
using.  "I have others.  This should last you until you gain mastery of
your powers."
        "I'll fly you to the Great Forest in ANT 100," X offered.
        "Thanks," Maxl said.  "Thanks, everybody, for all you've
done...especially you, Kabuki."
        X and Maxl headed out, and flew off to the almost-vacant Great
Forest.  X landed in what looked like a likely spot, then let his passenger
go.  The two waved goodbye.
        Smiling, the badger walked off into the forest, thinking of what
good friends he'd met.
        Then, Maxl checked his watch.

-> True, I had forgotten that fact.  However, to my knowledge you'd have
-> to keep the same command letters (i.e. if you changed "King Arthur's
-> Weapons" to "Rotor's Weapons" you'd still have to type the letter "K"
-> to get in).

True: maby i could say  Rotor's (K)ick Butt Wepons :)

Also for the flirting with Violet and the bard when I change that to
Sally and Sonic I plan on removeing the sex options on them. Like when
you flirt with sally the command (c)arry her upstairs will not be on the
list and I will attach a note saying that the sysop should turn clan
mode ON to stop that.

Plus I will use LordEvents to add some stuff to the game.

Oh yeah...Da Story, written by my friend Brent Roberts.  I uploaded it
UUEncoded and got yelled at.  I'll probably put it up on my homepage, the
location of which I forget for the moment <G> as soon as Fraudigy gets more
organized.

Or, you could just change what it says, so that rather than "Carry her
Upstairs" it says something else...you CAN change the response text, can't you?

on Bookshire's page).  In case you want to check it out and/or add it to

Last night, I was thinking: aside from the small handfull of adult GIFs & 
JPEGs I carry on my FTP site (ftp:ftp.netcom.com/pub/qu/quozl/TTBS), and 
two pics in the Amy Rose story, I have not encountered much in the way of 
Bunnie pics, either adult or" clean", in spite of tonnes of 
Sonic/Tails/Sally pics... We need more Bunnie! :) Not simply 
framegrabs/scanned pics from the comics, but fan art...

Bunnie is the only cybernetic creature I *like*... :)

Yep, it's time for another response from me... (Just now going through 
the August archives....)

Yes, I did a double-take on seing that, too... They need to rename the 
guy, as (a) this is an already existing character name, and (b), many 
furryfans don't want to be reminded of one of the worst furry travesties 
to ever be published... :P

There has been some indication since #22 or 23 about a turn towards the 
direction of the SatAM cartoon. I have a feeling the "old" comic stories 
are being quietly faded out and the "new" (SatAM StH) stories are being 
slowly phased in... The general quality is improving, and many of the 
commentaries from both this list *and* my newsgroup (specificly my 
gripse? ;) ) are indeed being heeded to, as noting that a certain 
CyBunny(ie) is now making appearances in the comic, including last 
month's Bunnie backup! :)

I had a hard time making out the cover preview pic, but the return of 
Dulcy??? WAHOO!!! :) Looks like the SatAM StH makes a comeback via the 
comics! **YESSSS!**

This should be it for a while from me, 'less I've got something to say 
whilst I continue through this archive.. :)

>From the Desk of SOnic The Hedgehog,

	Hello friends!  I have returned from my summer vacation at last. 
I have FINALLY bought myself a Performa 638CDV machine (capable of
capturing video) and I am anxious to help the archives build up by buying
a couple StH tapes and capturing any frame from them.  Let the requests
roll in! :^)  

	And now the archives have found a new home on it too and it will
be ready by tomorrow (tuesday night Sept 5/95).  My new homepage can be
found at http://www.grcom.com/sonic4   and my old homepage is still there
if you folks want to see extra pictures from the largest archives ever
found or existed!  38MB of pictures and building up!  Some of my best art
can be found on the new page. Check it out Sonic Fans!

						SONIC-FULLY Yours,

HEY!  I resent that!  What, perchance, do you have against me and HX, not
to mention Kumba, ANT 100, etc.!  (If you don't know what I'm talking

Well, If I know Quozl as well as I think, I'd say that anser to that 
would be...there's one difference between you the above mentioned 
characters and Bunnie...she's female, and she has one hell of a sexy 
figure (despite her robotic limbs (or perhaps because of them ))

Ok 2 things

1:Someone on one of the local bbses gave me a picture he had in his
sonic collection. It was one of thoes gory PICs. And if you all wanted
to know it is the stupedest picture I ever saw. It is only the HFF.GIF
file with tails geting stabed and impailed. It's reall cheesy. I am
beting that the rest of thoes gore PICs are like that. I really don't
care myself. I still have it and might keep it for a bit longer so if
you for some reason really want to see it then e-mail me and I can
encode it for you and send it to you. I won't send it to the FTP because
it's just a waste of disk space.


2.I saw in an earlyer message that someone had 40 megs of pics and all
that or something. So Why don't they and hte FTP site put together a CD
Rom with all the pictures,Sounds,and Stories. I Think most Collages have
a machien that presses CDs form disks. You can bring a box of floppys
with all that on it, Press sevral Disks (If they will let you) and sell
them. I know if I found a Sonic pic/snd/txt/ CD then I whould buy it.
But the only problem is copyright laws.   Then again maby that isn't a
good idea.                       Well...   It was a good idea when it
was flawless.

Oh yes, I remember that! <VBG> Is Da Story the first part, that is, if I
read it, will all characters/plots be understood?

	That is me!  I am the one with the largest Sonic Art archives
around -- 38 megs of SOnic art and getting ready to capture video clips
from the weekday STH cartoon and from the weekend cartoon provided I get a
VCR so I can hook it up to my Performa 638CDV and do vid captures from it.
Its never a problem.  As for the CD's I am currently considering putting
this collection on CD Rom but the problem lies in the copyright issue.  I
could never sell for profit since that would be like saying "heyya Sega, I
got a collection and I'm profitting off of it" and its not right.  But for
private usage of CD Rom I am considering this route.

Alex,

That's not really necessary.  Archie Comics would still need a couple
weeks to process the order.  The time difference between Western Union
and surface mail would not make that much difference.  And why incur an
unnecessary expense.  Regular mail will be just fine?

Hi again.

I'm still looking for someone who could send me videotapes of first and  
mainly the second season of the SatAM Sonic The Hedgehog cartoon.

Anyone who can help me, but didn't already send me a reply, please send
e-mail to

        sanasi@deco.franken.de

to discuss the details.

If you are willing to help, please tell me the following details:

How are the episodes recorded (S-VHS/VHS, stereo/mono, slow play/long  
play, picture quality...)

Are the recordings with or without commercials?  If they are with
commercials, can you cut them out when you duplicate the tapes?

How long would it take you to send me the tapes and how much money would
you want in return?

Thanks in advance & sorry for sending all this to the mailing list, but  
it's the only chance I have to get those episodes.

Bye


Alessandro

   Take a look at:

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html

It gives a list of a lot of commands and how to use them.  (I'm not sure if
it lists all commands, but there are quite a bit.)  It definitely covers the
basics such as inplementing graphics and links.

I assume that total of 7 includes "whatsup" by Bill Fortier.  I'd rate
it PG-13, but it was a bit strong for my taste, thus I didn't keep it.
Bunny was a little too old, too stacked, and too unclothed for my taste...

You might be able to distribute it if you just charge the cost of the CD 
and the cost (if any) for putting the stuff on the CD.

I was browsing through my local Toys `R Us, and I discovered a
plethera (a whole bunch of) Archie Sonic the Hedgehog Comics at
the checkouts. 
	They are sold in two packs. I've seen many different 
issues, including the Princess Sally Mini-Series. 
	If you missed these issues at the store, and do not wish
to order them through Archie Comics, here is your chance. Good
Hunting!

Yes, in the comic, #28, page 5, bottom-middle panel, there is a very clear
shot of that. I remember noting that to myself. Oh well, shame on us for 
even thinking about that! :-)

Two images from the Fleetway Publications (UK) comic are now available on 
the ftp site (rat.org).  The filenames are fleetw01.jpg and fleetw02.jpg 
in the /pub/sonic/images/comic directory.

For those of you using the Web, the URL's are:
ftp://rat.org/pub/sonic/images/comic/fleetw01.jpg
ftp://rat.org/pub/sonic/images/comic/fleetw02.jpg

If you have never before seen the Fleetway comics, do take a few moments 
to d/l these images.

Many other way past cool files are on the ftp site too.  If you haven't 
logged on lately, take another look now.

Thanks.
I woudl recommend start doing this now, so you won't have to remember

I just picked October 1st as a date that is far enough away that people

That subject line reminds me I've always wanted to start up a really
okatu-tangential-useless-futile discussion about Bunnie's bio-cybernetic
systems.  Feel free to hit `n' if you can't stand wild speculations
from someone who sits at a console all day. :)

...

With so much of her physiology being replaced (the bone marrow in
the legs produce nearly all the body's blood cells, for example),
the bionics would certainly be involved to some [major] degree with
supporting her organic systems..  A rather impressive feat,
considering that they're continuing to function successfully on an
unanticipated case (ie: half-robotised); this shows a substantial
amount of intelligence on behalf of the maintenance nanites (or
whatever).

If she has an intelligent cybernetically augmented immune&etc
system, has her healing rate and other bodily production and
replacement functions improved or depreciated?  Is she effectively
immortal now?  (Insert a thousand story ideas here. :)

Do the limbs have their own power supply (feel free to guess wildly
what it could be) or do they draw power from the organics?  If the
limbs do have their own source of energy, can this be used to
replenish organic energy systems like the ATP/ADP cycle? (Rather
simple to do, if the nanites can handle the endocrines) ...so does
Bunnie need to eat?  (What /does/ she eat? :) How are wastes taken
care of? (Absorption by the nans, I'd think.  How else here has read
"Blood Music", by Greg Bear? :)

>From the loads she's placed on it, I would say that her skeleton
(at least the spine, collar bones and hips) is probably all

her...  (Is she just like a Terminator with only a skin-deep cute

Chris,

Sounds like you've thought this through  ;-) .

For my part, I got no further than the problem of how a living organism
handles the byproducts of mechanical systems.  My short answer: it can't;
over time, being roboticized will kill you.  That's one of the subplots
I worked into my story, "Bloodlines."

As for being deroboticized, it would probably take far longer than
simple roboticization.  The latter simply requires that robotic elements
attach to a biological host; in order to deroboticize, you have to
remove the robotics while making sure you don't damage the host any more
than it has already been.  Proof once again of Drazen's Law of
Restitution: the time it takes to correct a situation is inversely
proportional to the time it took to do the damage [e.g., it takes longer
to lose x number of pounds than it did to gain x number of pounds].

   The point of roboticzation was to turn someone into a robot.  The systems
were not designed to cooperate with the organic parts of the body, they were
designed to completely replace them.  So, her body's immune system would stay
the same, but her limbs' immune system is now much better.
   The organic part of her is not immortal, but the robotic part is.  (It was
never "alive" in the first place, though.)  If her head exploded, I'm sure
she'd die.  If her arm exploded, she could replace it.

   Something has to power the limbs.  But, as I said above, they weren't
designed to draw power from the organic parts of the body.  So, they must
have their own power supply.  The power could be used to replenish the
organic systems, but would have to be reconfigured somehow.
   An arm and two legs isn't much power.  If their power is being used both
to walk and to give Bunnie energy, she isn't getting much energy.  So she
probably still has to eat something.  If her stomach and digestive system are
still organic, she can eat anything she normally would.  If not, (since Unlce
Chuck can eat a chili dog) there's some kind of stomach-thing that can store
food until it's used for energy.  After it's used, the waste could either be
excreted by normal means or taken away more subtly by the nanites.

Not that any of you guys probally care, but the new Pumbaa and Timon 
show featured a squirrel voiced by Rob Paulsen. It was kinda cool 
because this guy also voiced Antoine. Just thought ya-all might want 
to know.

Now, some may say this is off topic, but I just thought I'd share my 
views about the stuff they replaced Sonic with on ABC having just 
finished watching the Preview tonight:

"Madeline": 
Hmmm...if there's one show in the lineup that won't last til 
the end of the season, it's this one.  It vaguely resembles a VERY poor 
attempt to force kids to learn friendship, and kindness and give them the 
facade of what a wonderful place the world is.  Now, while I have no 
objection to such programming, a network saturday morning linup is NOT 
the place for it.  I mean, you'd expect to see somthing like that on PBS, 
but certainly not here!

"Free Willy":
This won out and Sonic did not.  As I said to myself at the beginning of 
the last season, this show isn't worth the money they put into it.  The 
movies were fairly good, but this cartoon adaption is nowhere near that 
good and is, in my opinion, filled to the brim with bad acting.

"Dumb and Dumber":
Well...that certainly describes the idea to make a cartoon like this.  
The show makes absolutely no sense.  And, while that may be the point, I 
think they made a big mistake in this case due to the fact that they're 
trying to make money off slap-stick anttics of two characters in a movie 
who really can't be duplicated.  I saw a preview of "The Mask" on CBS a 
few weeks ago, and that guy was nowhere near as good as Jim Carrey 
himself.  I fear such will be the case here...an uninteristing show about 
poor copies of two fine comedians.

"Bump in the NIght":
Finally!!  A show that makes it worth turning on the TV every week.  If 
this season is anything like the last, it'll be just as good.  The 
combination of the unpredictable Mr. Bumpy, the timid, practical 
Squishington, and Molly the comfort doll, make for wonderful 
entertainment.  Then, at the end, we get a trip to the Kareoke Cafe, 
which also proves to be worth not changing the channel.  Indeed, a truely 
unique and entertaining show. :)

"Fudge":
Well...I never really watched an episode of this, however, knowing the 
book, it's not something I'd enjoy.  Besides, I think a RL sitcom has NO 
place on a Saturday Morning show.

"Reboot":
Excellent!! The second reason to turn on the TV tomarrow.  This is a 
wonderful example of the way in which ALL cartoon will be made in the 
future.  reboot is groundbreaking, in-your-face computer animation which 
leaves that lame 'Incredible Crash dummies' short to shame, both in plot 
and fluid, yet quick movement of animation.  Reboot is truely a show 
worth watching if for no other reason than seeing the cool animation.  
Most people who do this stuff concentrate so much on the tech stuff that 
they forget about good plot lines.  Not so here,  Reboot is a superb 
combination of computer animation and wonderful, involving plots.

"What a Mess":
A story about a dog named 'What a Mess' who spend most of his time making 
a mess...is that it?  If so, we got the makings for yet aANOTHER show 
that won't last the season...even if it does it won't last to a second 
season.  The animation is poor quality, even though that was probably the 
animators' intent, and I honestly don't see much potential for story 
lines here if they don't get off the idea of simply a dog making a mess.

"Bugs Bummy and Tweety":
Well, this stuff has been on Saturday mornings as long as I can remember, 
and it's good stuff.  It obviously had to be to last as long as it has (I 
think bugs is up to about 56 years now)  I won't talk too much about this 
since just about ervybody already has an opinion on these cartoons.


Well...that's it.  the ABC Saterday morning special is missing from the 
lineup this year, so I suspect it's finially outlived it's popularity 
even though it's been on for over 15 years.  some will miss it, other 
won't.  Other than that, I say that 'Bump in the Night" and "Reboot" are 
the ONLY good cartoons on ABC this season, and I really think it's sad 
that Sonic was cancelled to make room for uninteresting, and 'non-fun' 
show like these new one being introduced.  In fact, this is the FIRST 
season in my life as long as I can remember that I've been so completely 
turned off by the lineup available.  Hopefully it'll get better next 
season and none of this stuff (with those two exceptions) will be renewed.

Anyway, those are just my thoughts on what the idiots at ABC replaced our 
favorite Hedgehog with.

Long live Sonic, and may Madeline and company all get cancelled!!!!

I must not have explained myself very well...the reason I'm not including

According to my reckoning, the underground Knothole (in the first few
issues of the comic) was the first; the one used on the cartoon and in
current comics is the second.

Well umm an idea I had. Can you learn a simaler lang. to HTML called
VRML. If you did that you could have a VR Sonic world on the web page.
There are VR readers for all systems  Quicktimes VR. for Mac ,WebFX for
Netscape all that.


Also is it posable for someone out there to hook there computer up to a
VCR and get Quicktimes Movies off of the sonic tapes or do you need
special equipment to record .MOV files.

Special equipment, but anyone with a Mac and the appropriate hardware 
(Sonic?) or an Amiga with a VLab Motion or similar card should be able to 
do it...

If anyone does make a .MOV file, please make a .AVI conversion too.  I 
can play .AVI files but I cannot play .MOV files.

Actually, the Subject line should read "U.S.[A. Network carrying the]
Blue [Dude], but I wanted to drop the title of a Grateful Dead tune in
somewhere.

It's official: the blue dude with the attitute has jumped to USA.  The
Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog will be shown M-F, at 8:30 am Eastern,
7:30 Central, as part of the Cartoon Express package.  Consult your
local listings, program your VCRs and order cable if you don't have it.
But don't rely on the series for anything canonical; you gotta draw the
line SOMEwhere!

BTW: who else thinks that the Fleetway comics art is awe-inspiring?

The TV Guide here says "Cartoon Express [2 hours]" and that's it. I'll have
to find out exactly when it's on. 
"The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"... Isn't that the crappy one everyone
always complains about being shit compared to the Sat AM. version? OH well, I
think I'll watch it. Poor quality sonic is better than no sonic! Tails is in
it, right? :-)

I have placed two new sounds on the ftp site.

cronhurl.zip  Antoine: I think I will croon.
              Sonic: I think I will hurl.
shtyrmth.zip  Sally: Shut your mouth, hedgehog!

Both are 8-bit mono .WAV files at 22kHz recorded on a SB16 card under 
Warp 3 MMOS/2.

If that's the one I've seen (about 7:30AM  M-F on Ch. 56 in the NH/MA 
area), it doesn't look too bad, but then again, I'm not in a place to 
make a comparison, as I've never watched the Sat. AM version.

Hey, these sounds are great quality! I especially love the croon/hurl one!

What eps are these from? I'm not sure, but is shtyrmth.zip from the Lezar ep?

Correct; croon/hurl is from "Spyhog".

I forgot who asked for these sounds, but I finally got around to 
digitizing them.

I will accept more requests (if you're not in a hurry (g)) for sounds.  I 
have 6 Saturday first season episodes, all Saturday second season 
episodes, and 0 weekday episodes.

With regard to the Sonic Canon (sounds like a weapon, no?), the
Adventures of is the least coherent and least consistent compared with
the SatAM show.  Still, it appears to be the only game in town.  Sorta
like if the comic only had artwork by Manak.  Until the SatAM version is
resurrected, it'll have to do.   Yes, the HFF is very much a part of the
show, but none of the other SatAM characters are in it.

A cybernetically augmented digestive system (with the nanites
destroying anything toxic) could mean she can try a few other things
as well. :)

Both the Archie and cartoon designs have let her keep her tail, so
I guess her anus, intestines, and all that, might still be original.
(The `Archie Bunnie' might just have metal pants-- that area was
about to be robotised from the outside-in when she managed to
escape..)

The derobotosation procedure I thought up for the intelligent
nanites idea would involve convincing the little cybers to refer to
the host's DNA instead of their ROMs. :)

(The 2nd season StHs have yet to show in Australia, but I'd like to
suggest thats what they tried on Bunnie in "Sonic Conversion".
Afterwards the nanites regained their original programming and they
rebuilt the bionics again..)

Before there was just fleetw01.jpg and fleetw02.jpg.
There are now 6 of them total.
Still B+W. :-(

Is the comic even in color?

        Alas, after seeing Sonic #28,  I have somthing to say. Looking
through "Growing Pains", I saw a cartoon, female fox. This made me loose
all hope that Sally is a fox. I'm sure I'll go into denial, but I'll pull
through.

        Thanks,

Hello once again.

I've just uploaded another four scans of the Fleetway Sonic comic from  
England to rat's FTP site (rat.org).  Look for them in the /pub/sonic/ 
images/comic directory.  Sorry that they are only black & white, but I  
still don't know anyone who has a color scanner.

Here is a brief description:

FLEETW01.JPG is a page from the story 'The Sonic Terminator', printed in  
issue #24 - #28 (adaption of the 'Sonic CD' game).  It shows Sonic  
fighting against Metal Sonic on the Miracle Planet.

FLEETW02.JPG is a page from the story 'Total Chaotix', printed in issue  
#53 - #58 (adaption of the 'Knuckles Chaotix game). It shows the Chaotix  
team entering Robotnik's abandoned Egg Fortress that has been taken over  
by the Brotherhood Of Metallix.

FLEETW03.JPG is a page from the story 'Disaster!', printed in issue #51 -  
#53 (adaption of the 'Sonic & Knuckles game).  It shows Sonic retrieving  
the Master Emerald after the final destruction of Robotnik's Death Egg.

FLEETW04 JPG and FLEETW05.JPG are two pages from the story 'Pirates Of The  
Mystic Cave', printed in issue #23.  It shows Sonic & Tails searching for  
Amy Rose in the Mystic Caves.

FLEETW06.JPG is a page from the story 'Power Of The Chaos Emeralds',  
printed in issue #35 - #36.  It shows Knuckles defeating Robotnik after  
Robotnik has absorbed the Chaos Emerald energy to become invincible.

Hope you like them


Alessandro

Wait a sec... where in SatSonic did you get to see her "naughty bits"?
The only bit of info I've seen here is in a Doug Winger drawing.  By 
the way... I like alot of his drawings... however I could do without
most of the bad captions. [he also draws ugly squirrel heads]

My answer to the question:  Does Bunnie have naughty bits under her dress?
  It doesn't matter if that part is roboticized or not...   The answer is
  still 'No'... why?  She's a toon!  Toon's don't have naughty bits!

I guess this is also the answer to a recent alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog post 
from a guy asking if Tails the two-tailed fox also had two err.. um.. 
[cover your eyes minors...] two buttholes.  Following the above logic the 
answer is no.. he has zero.

Okay... so sue me for not treating this subject seriously  :-)

I would disagree on this point, but it is only in how some folks define 
naughty bits.  Since the SatAm, and unfortunatly the other, versions 
are made for the American (reads western) market, any suggestive (ahem, 
ahem) things got zapped by PS&P.

You're right, besides, they (the buttholes) are on MTV.

Along the lines of obscene/non obscene, in some cultures the absence of a 
character being anatomically correct would be considered offensive.

I'm back from my "vacation" now I have to catch up on two weeks of 
posts.  To misquote Antoine, "Sacre Bleu Cheese!"

Alessandro:

MANY THANKS for sending the photocopies from the UK Sonic comics.  Even
in miniature, the artwork looks impressive.  While I'm not that big a
fan of comics and stories built around the games, I appreciated the
emerald information.  I still play to write a Mobius apocalypse one day
which ties up absolutely all the loose ends, and the information about
the Gray Emerald was very helpful.  If there's anything I can do to
repay your kindness, please let me know.

Dear Alexandra,

Have received the money order and placed an order for a subscription.
As soon as I receive an issue I'll send it on to you at the address you
specified.  Should be a couple more weeks before that happens.

Hey friend.I=B4m very grateful with you.Anything that you want or whatever
that I can do for you,ask me for it.On the other hand I want you to know
that here in
Mexico we had today an earthquake of 7.2 degrees in the Richter scale,by
this cause in this moment I=B4m scared,I=B4d like that there were no nuclear
tests on
France,the universitaries said that the nuclear tests were the cause of the
earthquake.Do you know something about the theme?Now my only hope is that=
 these
tests finish in May of 1996 how they said.

Thank you!!!=20

Your friend

The address and prices are both in Dan Drazen's FAQ (faq-dd.txt) on the 
rat.org ftp site at /pub/sonic/text.  I think the prices were only given 
in pounds.  You can check with your bank to get the exchange rate (some 
newspapers also print this on the stock market page).

The address is also given in the merchandise list 
(http://rat.org/sonic/merchandise.html) in the Suppliers section.

NOTICE: The fact that episode and story summaries appear here
means there is a good chance that you will encounter spoilers. 
This is your only notice!

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season (see FAQ #9).

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

#28 [Nov 1995]
"Saturday Noght's Alright For A Fight" [3 parts]
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
     Having penetrated into the Knothole control center, Sonic
basically begins beating up on everyone in sight.  This includes
the ladies--he puts Sally in a headlock, and escapes from a leg
scissors by Bunnie.  Eventually (by the end of Part 2) Sonic is
knocked out, the bug implanted on him discovered, he recovers
from his amnesia and the plot resolved.  
Sonic Art
"Growing Pains", Part 1
Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
     Tails is still upset at Sonic for having "slapped [him]
around" in the previous story, and resentful of Sally for keeping
the Sea Fox in dry dock as a "floating crib."  Thanks to the oil
he got from the gull in "Submersible Rehearsal" (the Triple
Trouble special), he sets out on his own.  Coming upon an
uncharted island, he comes to the rescue of Fiona, a captive
female fox, and instantly falls in love with her.  Fiona,
however, is an automaton set up as bait by Robotnik.  Tails is
trapped by Fiona, and Fiona herself starts the process of
roboticizing Tails [to be continued].
SonicGrams: More info about the Tails miniseries coming up --
apparently, the actions moves to "Downunda," the Mobian
equivalent of Australia; Freddy Mendez has moved on to other
editorial work within Archie Comics; two letters to Sonic elicit
replies about the Tails miniseries, and elicits the information
that Sonic is 15; and one letter to Sally asks how to become a
freedom fighter (I think actually being on Mobius would be a
plus).

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the

Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 ("All The
Mail's About Tails!").  Theories range from transplantation to
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no "official"
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
(in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with "Deadliest of
the Species" in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving"
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
"creative differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
delay.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby."



Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
of the "Doomsday" episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original four-part Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
     Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
     Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher & Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2  [Sep 1993]
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.

#3  [Oct 1993]
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4  [Nov 1993]
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.


#5  [Dec 1993]
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6  [Jan 1994]
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7  [Feb 1994]
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8  [Mar 1994]
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
the hall.


#9  [Apr 1994]
     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate eil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10  [May 1994]
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11  [Jun 1994]
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12  [Jul 1994]
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13  [Aug 1994]
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14  [Sep 1994]
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.


#15  [Oct 1994]
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     


#16  [Nov 1994]
     [Summary by Erich Schulman]
     "Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
     "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. "The Mail's About
Tails" (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
from the roboticizer ("Rabbit Deployment," #3).  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.



#17  [Dec 1994]
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.



#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night" (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
     Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
     An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
     Story and art: Scott Shaw!
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
     /Spaziante
     Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile
evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.



Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
     "Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich &
          Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.
     Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
far and describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is
renouned for his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally & Geoffrey
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
     Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD),
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).




#22 [May 1995]
     "The Return"
     Penders/Spaziante & Harvey M.
     The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with
Children; cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_). 
Sonic & Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics," (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
deactivates "Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
"You owe me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
Spaziante artwork.
     "Tails Knighttime Story,"
     Decesare/Manak & John Dagostino
     As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows"
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
     Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep
reading."  Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
"creative differences" theory in Q7.


Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species": Part 2
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed).
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
if so what does she look like? "Of course...her origin may yet be
told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in "Bloodlines"
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.




#23   [Jun 1995]
     "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
order to save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
which I'm not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
     "Vol-ANT-teer"
     Decesare/Manak
     Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.


Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
the chamber blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred. 
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

SallyGram: Horace Hawkins (14) wishes Sally a Happy Valentine's
Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
     "When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
     Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
     Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
     "Panic in the Sky!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hrair_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
     "Fire Drill"
     Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.
     "Lord of the Floating Island"
     Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
     While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25  [Aug 1995]
     "Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
     Story: Mike Gallagher
     Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zone portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
     "Way, Way Past Cool"
     Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
     "Fortified"
     Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.

#27 [Oct 1995]
"A Scrambled Hedgehog"
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
     While retrieving a message in Robotropolis, Sonic collides
with a SWATbot with sufficient force to knock himself out. 
Coming to in Robotnik's headquarters, Sonic displays all the
symptom [singular] of that favorite condition of writers
everywhere: amnesia.  Robotnik passes himself off as Sonic mentor
and advisor.  After working out on some Freedom Fighter dummies
left over from the Princess Sally miniseries, and after having
had a microtransmitter planted on his person, Sonic is sent to
Knothole to "observe the underground terrorist group."  Sonic
enters a secret tunnel entrance to Knothole, but Rotor's security
system detects the bug.  Rotor tries everything he can to stop
Sonic before he can get out of the tunnel, but Sonic spins his
way out to the surface and enters Knothole, apparently under the
impression that his orders are to combat rather than observe.  To
be continued.
     At least the artwork didn't go schizo, switching from
Mawhinney to Manak halfway through.  Anyone else get the
reference to the Patrick McGoohan cult TV classic, "The
Prisoner," on page 3?
     Sonic Art: I know he's only 6, but Mitchell Resk's drawing
of Sonic makes him look like he's wearing a diaper.
     Triple Trouble Coming Attractions
     Gallagher/Manak
     Essentially a two-page ad for the upcoming issue.  Weirdest
panel is the one inviting readers to CHECK OUT PRINCESS SALLY IN
A HOT PINK STRING BIKINI, just before Sally nixes the idea.  And
this is the same Sally who went through the first season on TV
wearing nothing in the world but a pair of boots!  Apparently,
Gallagher is also Not Clear On The Concept when it comes to
clothing and furries.  Oh well, there are always the WEB site
pictures....
     Sonic Grams: PUH-LEEEZE lose the office humor; it's taking
up valuable space that could be used by "Noted From The Net"
[whatever happened to that idea?].  Recaps the contents of the
Triple Trouble issue, plus indicates that #28 will include the
preamble to the Tails miniseries.  Someone asks about Sonic's
sneakers; Robotnik gets a fan letter; and someone asks the names
of Sonic & Sally's offspring from #22.


Game Gear Adaptation #1 [Oct 1995]
Triple Trouble issue
     "Tttriple Tttrouble!!!"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
Robotnik miscalculates when trying to exploit a Chaos Emerald as
a power source, and the stone splits into two fragments.  One
half lands in the Great Forest where a new set of action zones is
created.  The other half lands on Knuckles' floating island where
it starts burrowing into a mountain.  Knuckles investigates but
is hit on the head by a rock and loses consciousness.  As for
Sonic, he enters the new zones to retrieve the shard, but as soon
as he does so he's knocked out by Knack the Weasel.  As for
Knuckles, he comes to in a cave surrounded by a group of Ancient
Walkers--cave-dwellers wearing masks.  After some exposition
about how if the half emerald should come in contact with the
Floating Island's emerald it'll blow the place apart, Knuckles is
returned to the surface in time to trash Knack, who happens to
have Sonic in the trunk of his vehicle.  Sonic & Knuckles start
to resume their old grudge match when Robotnik contacts Knack in
order to keep the plot moving.  Sonic & Knuckles reunite the
Emerald which disappears; they then part company after exchanging
insincerities and mutual distrust.  As for the emerald, it
reappears in the possession of the Ancient Walkers.
     "Submersible Rehearsal"
     Story: Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
Tails' joy as Rotor finishes work on The Sea Fox is punctured
when he learns that Sally has instructed Rotor not to put any oil
in the sub (fuel or lubricating? It doesn't say).  Tails then
learns that Robotnik has an octobot terrorizing sea creatures;
this information comes from an oil-soaked gull.  Draining the oil
from the gull to power the Sea Fox, Tails defeats the octobot and
destroys the underwater robot factory.  This is all prelude to
the Tails miniseries--a full-page ad shows Spaziante cover
designs, but we all remember what happened to the cover designs
for the Princess Sally miniseries, don't we?
     "First Contact"
     Story & Art: Ken Penders
Back on the floating island, Knuckles interrupts a tussle with
Vector to investigate what he thinks is a Robotnik invasion
attempt.  But it turns out he's being taunted (as in "Fire Drill"
in Sonic & Knuckles #1) by someone whose name turns out to be
Archimedes.  He leads Knuckles to the Chaos Chamber where he
tells Knuckles that "only when you can find me will we know that
you are capable of seeing the answer within the question."  The
solution promised in the upcoming Knuckles Chaotix issue.


#28 [Nov 1995]
"Saturday Noght's Alright For A Fight" [3 parts]
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
     Having penetrated into the Knothole control center, Sonic
basically begins beating up on everyone in sight.  This includes
the ladies--he puts Sally in a headlock, and escapes from a leg
scissors by Bunnie.  Eventually (by the end of Part 2) Sonic is
knocked out, the bug implanted on him discovered, he recovers
from his amnesia and the plot resolved.  
Sonic Art
"Growing Pains", Part 1
Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
     Tails is still upset at Sonic for having "slapped [him]
around" in the previous story, and resentful of Sally for keeping
the Sea Fox in dry dock as a "floating crib."  Thanks to the oil
he got from the gull in "Submersible Rehearsal" (the Triple
Trouble special), he sets out on his own.  Coming upon an
uncharted island, he comes to the rescue of Fiona, a captive
female fox, and instantly falls in love with her.  Fiona,
however, is an automaton set up as bait by Robotnik.  Tails is
trapped by Fiona, and Fiona herself starts the process of
roboticizing Tails [to be continued].
SonicGrams: More info about the Tails miniseries coming up --
apparently, the actions moves to "Downunda," the Mobian
equivalent of Australia; Freddy Mendez has moved on to other
editorial work within Archie Comics; two letters to Sonic elicit
replies about the Tails miniseries, and the information that
Sonic is 15; and one letter to Sally asks how to be a freedom
fighter (I think actually being on Mobius would be a plus).




NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.org ?

I still question the practice of posting large documents to the mailing list. 
We keep it at the FTP site, isn't that enough? It doesn't matter to me since
I don't have to download all the mail I get, but for people who have Eudora
or whatever, and have to download all the mail they get, it must be a bummer
for them.

Good point; I'm always fighting disk space problems myself, so all I do is 
read the what's new section and then delete the mail.  I suspect that the 
list is now stable enough that all Dan really needs to do is send out just 
the what's new section with a pointer to the FTP site and/or a note to 
e-mail him for the complete FAQs.

This is not meant to knock Dan or his efforts at compiling and maintaining 
the FAQs - I do appreciate it, but I really only care about the new stuff.

	I found in an old issue of Sonic, #02, which addressed a
very important issue - how did Tails get his two tails? Well, I
just completed scanning these two pages and they are now 
available for viewing, thanx to RatMan and his FTP site. Both

To subscribe the comic, you may try to write to

        SONIC THE COMIC
        Subs Dept.
        Aim Ltd.
        PO Box 10
        Pallion Industrial Estate
        Sunderland, SR4 6SN
        England

To order back issues, write to

        SONIC BACK ISSUE ZONE
        Aim Ltd.
        PO Box 10
        Sunderland, SR4 6SN
        England

The price is 1.20 pounds sterling for each issue (price has been  
increased), including postage & packing.  Minimum order is four issues.  
Checks must be payable to _Fleetway Editions Ltd._ and must be in pounds  
sterling.  (Maybe it will cost more because you live in America... better  
call them by phone first.)

To ask them questions about a subscription and/or order by credit card
dial 01144-91-510-2290.

You may also try to send e-mail to their fan-page (much like the
Sonic-Grams page).  The address is

        stc@richb.demon.co.uk

Here is a list of some of the REAL good stories in the Fleetway Sonic  
comic (they have some that are crap too, but not nearly as much as Archie  
has).  You can also check the STC Story Checklist that I posted earlier  
for more info.

If you like Knuckles solo-stories:

_Karnival Night Conspiracy_, issue #39 - #44
  The Marxio Brothers try to take over the Carnival Night Zone on the
  Floating Island.

_Total Chaotix_, issue #53 - #58
  Adaption of the 'Knuckles Chaotix' game.  The Chaotix team fights the
  Brotherhood Of Metallix in Robotnik's abandoned Egg Fortress.

If you want stories about our blue speedster Sonic The Hedgehog:

_Super Sonic_, issue #7
  Sonic saves the Oil Ocean Zone and turns into Super Sonic while he
  fights an Aquis.

_The Origin Of Sonic_, _Back To Reality_ and _Megatox_, issue #8 - #10
  This is something like a 3-part-story.  Sonic's and Robotnik's origin
  is explained, referring to the Fleetway storyline.  This is also the
  start of a new concept in the Fleetway comic.  More 'adult' stories,
  Robotnik now uses 'real' SWATBot armies instead of the usual Badniks
  from the game etc.

_Girl Trouble_, issue #21 - #22
  First appearance of Amy Rose.  Sonic saves Amy from being turned into
  a Badnik by Robotnik.  Amy becomes a member of Sonic's Freedom Fighter
  group.

_The Sonic Terminator_, issue #24 - #28
  Adaption of the 'Sonic CD' game... real thrilling.  Metal Sonic kidnaps
  Amy Rose to lure Sonic to the Miracle Planet and finish him off.  Sonic
  defeats Metal Sonic by travelling back in time and chnaging the past.

_Enter Knuckles_ and _Power Of The Chaos Emeralds_, issue #33 - #36
  Adaption of the 'Sonic III' game.

_Day Of The Death Egg_, _Mystery Of The Sandopolis Zone_,
_Count Down To Disaster_ and _Disaster!_, issue #45, #47 - #53
  Adaption of the 'Sonic & Knuckles' game.  This one is split into four
  chapters,  divided over eight issues.  Sonic & Knuckles fight Robotnik
  on the Floating Island, destroy the repaired Death Egg and retrieve the
  Master Emerald from Robotnik.

_The Brotherhood Of Metallix_, issue #59 - ?
  This is the sequel to the 'Knuckles Chaotix' adaption.  The Brotherhood Of
  Metallix has taken over Robotnik's abandoned Egg-Fortress in the Special
  Zone.  They kidnap Grimer (very similar to Snively, but much more
  intelligent) to build an Alpha Device for them.  Robotnik finally captures
  Sonic but has to join forces with him to have a chance to defeat the
  Metallixes.  Sonic enters the Special Zone, but he can't stop the
  Metallixes from escaping to the Miracle Planet (where Sonic defeated the
  first Metallix in 'The Sonic Terminator').

  This story is still running, the current issue is #60.  I also don't
  know what the Alpha Device is for.

If you are looking for Tails solo-stories, you should try to get

_Zonerunner & The Big Freeze_, issue #48 - #51
  Tails fights an evil robot called Nutzan Bolt, who has taken over the
  Chemical Plant Zone.

_The Revenge Of Trogg_, issue #59 - ?
  This is a Knuckles & Tails team-up.  Tails & Knuckles are brought to
  the Nameless Zone to save the Enchanter Kings.  (In the Fleetway
  Comic, this zone once was Tails' home, and because he wanted everyone
  there to be proud of him he told them that HE would be the hero of
  Mobius and not Sonic.)

Hope this helps

YES!!

While surfing the dial this past Sunday morning, I discovered that a
fond hope of mine had indeed come to pass:

The SatAM version of Sonic the Hedgehog is back on the air!

Specifically, the "Sonic Boom" ep was showing on the USA Network as part
of their AXT (Action Express Team) package, along with other cast-offs
[Exo-Squad, W.I.L.D.cats, etc].

So if you missed the first season of Sonic or if you didn't get your
dose of Doomsday, set those VCRs for Sunday, 9:00 am Eastern time
[CYLL]; you might also want to drop a Thank You note to USA network.

USA -- the remote stops here (tm) for the blue dude with an attitude!

I don't have USA's address, but I did call them a few years ago.  
Hopefully this voice number is still current:  (212) 408 9100.

Hello there. I'm Joseph from FurToonia, and I've recently discovered this
mailing list.  I'm a rather large Sonic fan, so I was rather dismayed when
I finally realized ABC wasn't carryin StH anymore.  So...

I wrote this message on the bulletin board on FurToonia.  I'm sending it,
in a slightly altered form, to this list in hopes of arousing your interest
in my plan.

-- Message --

As many of you may know, the SatAM Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon has been 
recently (ok, not THAT recently) cancelled.  While the first 2 seasons are
now floating around USA (praise USA!) Network, the demand for a 3rd season
(and the continuation of the series in general) has been rather high.
These are some of the reasons that come up repeatedly for reactivating the
show, and letting it have a 3rd season.  Your mileage may very.  
(In addition, please add your own, or improve the ones you see.)

1.  The final episode.  If the last episode of Sonic the Hedgehog was not
    the most extreme cliffhanger in the history of all Saturday morning
    cartoons, I'm not orange.  Even the SWAT Kats ended with a modicum 
    of closure; all of THEIR bad guys were DEAD.  What of Snively, and the
    mysterious eyes behind him?  What happened to Robotnik?  What about the
    King?  (Talk about your cartoonus interruptus...) 

2.  This was a *good* show.  It gave all SORTS of good messages.  It was 
    pro-environment (the good guys live in peace with nature, badniks
    destroy it), anti-pollution (ditto), and even had the good taste to 
    have a hero who wasn't `dark and gritty' or `cute and cloying', but 
    rather is/was a fun, sarcastic (but not cruel) young adult.  It wasn't
    overly violent, nor an (excessively) obvious merchandising gimmick.

3.  It was also a "good" show in the respect that it was well-written and
    animated.  Very rarely does such a quality show end up on ABC, and
    especially during the SatAM merchandising-block.  It had drama.  Pathos.    
    And it was *funny* sometimes, too.  It was a show that anyone of any
    age could watch and appreciate on some level.  

4.  I only need to gesticulate toward Scratchwood's (http://rat.org/bookshire) 
    Web page and the various other fandom pages to demonstrate the amount 
    of Sonic fandom out and about on the net today.  And that's just what *I*
    know of on the Net, mind you.  There's probably a lot more out there I 
    don't know about.  The comic book also has a large following.  And I'm
    sure these people would gladly buy any products that any sponsor of the
    show would produce, and recommend X product to their friends.

Now, if you're interested in saving this show from the bit bucket, please
keep watching this board for more info.  Details as they become apparent.

-- End --

(Well, that's what I was able to come up with.)  

Now, here's what I'm thinking here...basically, all we do are these 
three things:

1.  The first thing we'd need to do is to write a message basically
    explaining to someone unknowledgeable on the subject what the
    show is, and the circumstances surrounding its cancellation.  Then, we
    explain why we feel it is good (in a thesis-like form), so to convince 
    Iggy Internet (or whoever) to assist us in our cause.

2.  Then, a letter should immediately follow the previous message that one
    could send to (our main enemy) Sega.  It would be pretty similar to   
    the thesis about why the show is good; it would explain why we want
    Sega to give permission back to DiC to make StH episodes, and our 
    willingness to fully support them if they do.  (If we need to write a
    2nd letter, this will be slightly more threatening.)

3.  Then, the important thing will be distributing the information to the
    masses.  SirKain (sirkain@usa.pipeline.com) will spread it through 
    his various BBS connections, and I'll send it all over Usenet's
    various animation and furry groups, and hit as many furry MU* bulletin
    boards as I possibly can.  (Please don't hesistate to do so yourself,
    either.)  Every little bit helps, so we'd hope that you'd stick
    the info wherever you think it'd be cool, and tell all your friends 
    to send in letters, too.

Then, all we'd have to do is distribute and soapbox about the situation
until something gets done.  Make your whole family sign at the bottom.
Hell, go up and down the street with a petition.  The more names you get,
the better chance we've got of getting a 3rd season (or at least some sort
of closure episode) out of Sega.  

So, whaddya think?  If we all work together on this, we could probably at
least make enough noise to make them notice us.  Send your replies to the
list.  

Thanks,

						-- That cyberpunk.

Hello there. I'm Joseph from FurToonia, and I've recently discovered this
mailing list.  I'm a rather large Sonic fan, so I was rather dismayed when
I finally realized ABC wasn't carryin StH anymore.  So...

I wrote this message on the bulletin board on FurToonia.  I'm sending it,
in a slightly altered form, to this list in hopes of arousing your interest
in my plan.

-- Message --

As many of you may know, the SatAM Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon has been 
recently (ok, not THAT recently) cancelled.  While the first 2 seasons are
now floating around USA (praise USA!) Network, the demand for a 3rd season
(and the continuation of the series in general) has been rather high.
These are some of the reasons that come up repeatedly for reactivating the
show, and letting it have a 3rd season.  Your mileage may very.  
(In addition, please add your own, or improve the ones you see.)

1.  The final episode.  If the last episode of Sonic the Hedgehog was not
    the most extreme cliffhanger in the history of all Saturday morning
    cartoons, I'm not orange.  Even the SWAT Kats ended with a modicum 
    of closure; all of THEIR bad guys were DEAD.  What of Snively, and the
    mysterious eyes behind him?  What happened to Robotnik?  What about the
    King?  (Talk about your cartoonus interruptus...) 

2.  This was a *good* show.  It gave all SORTS of good messages.  It was 
    pro-environment (the good guys live in peace with nature, badniks
    destroy it), anti-pollution (ditto), and even had the good taste to 
    have a hero who wasn't `dark and gritty' or `cute and cloying', but 
    rather is/was a fun, sarcastic (but not cruel) young adult.  It wasn't
    overly violent, nor an (excessively) obvious merchandising gimmick.

3.  It was also a "good" show in the respect that it was well-written and
    animated.  Very rarely does such a quality show end up on ABC, and
    especially during the SatAM merchandising-block.  It had drama.  Pathos.    
    And it was *funny* sometimes, too.  It was a show that anyone of any
    age could watch and appreciate on some level.  

4.  I only need to gesticulate toward Scratchwood's (http://rat.org/bookshire) 
    Web page and the various other fandom pages to demonstrate the amount 
    of Sonic fandom out and about on the net today.  And that's just what *I*
    know of on the Net, mind you.  There's probably a lot more out there I 
    don't know about.  The comic book also has a large following.  And I'm
    sure these people would gladly buy any products that any sponsor of the
    show would produce, and recommend X product to their friends.

Now, if you're interested in saving this show from the bit bucket, please
keep watching this board for more info.  Details as they become apparent.

-- End --

(Well, that's what I was able to come up with.)  

Now, here's what I'm thinking here...basically, all we do are these 
three things:

1.  The first thing we'd need to do is to write a message basically
    explaining to someone unknowledgeable on the subject what the
    show is, and the circumstances surrounding its cancellation.  Then, we
    explain why we feel it is good (in a thesis-like form), so to convince 
    Iggy Internet (or whoever) to assist us in our cause.

2.  Then, a letter should immediately follow the previous message that one
    could send to (our main enemy) Sega.  It would be pretty similar to   
    the thesis about why the show is good; it would explain why we want
    Sega to give permission back to DiC to make StH episodes, and our 
    willingness to fully support them if they do.  (If we need to write a
    2nd letter, this will be slightly more threatening.)

3.  Then, the important thing will be distributing the information to the
    masses.  SirKain (sirkain@usa.pipeline.com) will spread it through 
    his various BBS connections, and I'll send it all over Usenet's
    various animation and furry groups, and hit as many furry MU* bulletin
    boards as I possibly can.  (Please don't hesistate to do so yourself,
    either.)  Every little bit helps, so we'd hope that you'd stick
    the info wherever you think it'd be cool, and tell all your friends 
    to send in letters, too.

Then, all we'd have to do is distribute and soapbox about the situation
until something gets done.  Make your whole family sign at the bottom.
Hell, go up and down the street with a petition.  The more names you get,
the better chance we've got of getting a 3rd season (or at least some sort
of closure episode) out of Sega.  

So, whaddya think?  If we all work together on this, we could probably at
least make enough noise to make them notice us.  Send your replies to the
list.  

Thanks,

Interesting; I didn't know that (I gave up on SK since all I was doing was 
drooling over Callie and Felina, and that's not good for me...)

But it was fairly subtle about it, unlike, say, Captain Planet...

The only other one that comes to mind was the first season of Ewoks.
But actually Reboot has many of the same elements, but it's such a 
different show that I'm not sure the comparison is valid.

Depends on the product - I don't know about Sonic underwear, cereal, or 
canned pasta product with imitation cheese :^)

It has yet to be determined just who the "enemy" is here; Sega, DIC, or ABC.

Here's where I have a problem; "threats" never work, especially when 
they're idle ones; just _how_ would you "threaten" them?  There's nothing 
to boycott, which is all they care about.  The only possible exception is 
the video games, and let's face it, most fans of the show and/or comic 
either have already bought all the video games they're going to, or they 
don't buy them in the first place (I'm in the latter category).

>So, whaddya think?  If we all work together on this, we could probably at
>least make enough noise to make them notice us.  

I think that while it would be nice to have Sonic back, it would also be 
nice to have new Tiny Toons too; given the current marketing/programming 
situation, I don't expect to see either again.  All we can do is keep the 
memories alive via the list, Usenet, and fan-fic, and/or move on to 
whatever replaces them (unfortunately, none of the replacements (for Sonic 
_or_ TTA) are nearly as good).

If you were paying attention, I said I moved the lists to a new server. It
should be "lists.mv.net", but I made aliases on sard for people that forget. 
You should keep in your records that it's "sonic@lists.mv.net".

I had one of my local bookstores order all of Teitelbaum's books, and 3 
actually came in.  I bought a copy of my local paper when picking up my 
order.

While reading the comics pages, a little flash of inspiration hit me:  
what if Sonic had a daily comic in the newspaper?

If he had one -- and if it was good -- I'd be willing to buy the paper 
every day instead of 2-4 times a week.

Would it be possible to keep such a comic going within the limits of the 
amount of a story one could tell in 4 daily panels, and without creating 
yet another universe unlike the universes of the comic books and cartoons 
which are already different enough?  Which characters should be in a 
daily comic?  And, most importantly, is there enough of a market to 
interest a syndicator?  Or could Archie Comics become interested in 
taking on this project?

And for those of you really into the daily comics, any preferences for 
writers, artists, or syndicator?

Well, here's how I think it went down:

DiC, being the giving sort they are, sold some original StH cels somewhere.
Sega, sensing that they weren't getting a cut, promptly took away DiC's
rights to the show, and therefore ABC recieved no more of it.  It's not the
messenger, it's the badniks^H^H^H^H news itself.

Well, boycotts aren't the only way to annoy a company.  We could, for
example, start raising a stink in the press...maybe get the attention of
WiReD or something.  One of Rotor's (sirkay@usa.pipeline.com) friends has
this list of news sources that can be reached via the net.  Maybe we could
try to explain to them our plight, if the mail-in campaign doesn't work.

Also, I was musing over the idea of putting our downloadable form letter on
a web page, and then get it as many links as physically possible (Yahoo, et
al).  Since several people around could do this, I was thinking of asking
around later after someone helps me write it up.

I disagree.  I think we've got an excellent opportunity now (being that StH
is currently lurking about on USA) to not only show that the program does
have a *residual* audience, but one that could be enlarged signifigantly. 
That's where we come in.  If we can attract enough people to the show now,
while the fire is hot, perhaps the new fans would be willing to help get
the show a 3rd season, or at least a mini-movie explaining what the hoo-hah
happened after Doomsday.     

That's how I feel.  What's everyone else's stance on this?

1.  In a daily?  No, I doubt it.  In a Sunday-only, yeah.  StH is too big
    for the small print.  It'd have to be a Sunday comic.

2.  Sonic, Tails, and Sally would probably be the most realistic choices,
    with occasional appearances by Rotor and Bunnie, among others.  And
    you'd have to have Robotnik.

3.  Well, could be...

4.  Thing is, Archie.  'Nuff said.

It's possible, but....

I don't think StH would work as a gag strip.  The thing that has hooked
most fans (if I read the posts correctly) is the sense of narrative
about characters and situations.  As a result, the strip would have to
feature a story line that would extend out over the course of a number
of weeks or even months.  I suppose the best model (at least, the only
one I could think up at the moment) would be "The Phantom" in terms of
story structure and development.

As for artists: Mawhinney would be my first choice.  I enjoyed the work
he did in the Sally miniseries.  I would've opted for Spaziante but
after seeing his work in #25 I'm convinced that he'd find the 4-frame
format too confining.  Let's just pretend Manak doesn't even enter into
this conversation....

Well, here's another attempt at fanfic by yours truly.  A while back
there was quite a bit of discussion about possible futures for the
Knothole gang.  I offer this as an antidote.

                                 Chapter 3
     

     The day's activities had been routine.  The children had
either awakened before dawn on their own or else were gotten out
of bed by Rosie.  They slept two to a hut: Sally and Bunnie in
one hut, Antoine and Rotor in another, and Sonic and Tails (by
mutual insistence) in a third.  Rosie and Julayla knew that, when
the children were a little bit older and stronger -- probably in
the coming spring -- work would have to begin on additional huts to
encourage independent living and to prevent personality clashes. 
Rotor was especially eager to set up housekeeping on his own,
though the fastidious Antoine would have balked at the use of the
word "housekeeping" in the same sentence as Rotor's name.  It
seemed the one thing of which Rotor was incapable.  Spare parts and
unrecognizable electronic components littered his half of the hut
and drove Antoine to distraction.
     The children then went to have breakfast in the largest of
the huts in Knothole: a general purpose building that served as
both a mess hall and a classroom.  Bunnie tended to arrive last,
usually because she couldn't decide which color ribbons to use to
do up her ears.
     After the breakfast dishes were cleared away, it was time
for the children's schooling.  At ten years of age, they were
literate enough in the Mobian language, except for Antoine,
though his grasp of the planet's history was almost as complete
as Sally's.  Sally and Rotor were more adept at mathematics than
the others, and there was no question that Rotor outshone the
others in mechanics.  Bunnie worked to keep up with the others,
finding botany to be her easiest subject.  Sonic tended to lose
interest in just about everything after the first hour of
instruction.  Though Tails would spend some time in the classroom
in the mornings, he was basically playing school.
     By the time noon rolled around, Julayla would signal the end
of class.  From there, the children would tend to their chores,
for Knothole still required a fair amount of maintenance.  The
huts and the bridge across the river had to be maintained, and
that meant carpentry.  Rotor was able to fashion tools for some
of the tasks.  The vegetable gardens that helped sustain them
also needed tending.
     It was at this point that Sonic tended to make himself
scarce.  Not that he was lazy; as with his schoolwork, he simply
got bored easily.  But if Tails wanted to "help," Sonic would pull
his share of the load without complaint.  However Sonic might feel
about a particular task, he seemed to want to set a good example
for the adoring cub.
     Sally, however, would sometimes spend the afternoon in
Julayla's hut.  There they would review old volumes of Mobian
letters and lore that Julayla had managed to save during the
invasion, and the gaps in Sally's knowledge of the history of the
House of Acorn would be filled in.
     As evening approached, everyone gathered in the main hut for
the second meal of the day.  Then before bedtime, there would be
play outdoors (weather permitting).  Lately, this had meant
dividing up to play Capture the Flag, a game of which Sally never
seemed to tire.  Yet lately it seemed that nothing went right
when they played the game.  No matter what team configuration
they formed, something would happen to bring the game to a
premature halt.  Either Sonic would ignore strategy and make some
rash move that would give away his position, or else Bunnie would
refuse to try sneaking through foliage for fear of ruining her
ears, or else Antoine would find something new to complain about,
or else Tails (who was too young to take part in the game) would
give away Sonic's position by ignoring everyone else and walking
up to the hiding place of his older idol.
     But this afternoon, with a slight nip in the air and the
wind sounding through the trees, Sally seemed more than just lost
in thought as she looked at the blank piece of paper on the table
before her.
     "Your first question," Julayla said.  "What happened on this
date in the year 2275?" 
     Sally said nothing and wrote nothing.
     "Did you hear me, Princess?" 
     "I'm sorry, Julayla.  It's just that...oh, what's the point?" 
She let the pencil she was holding fall to the table.  Julayla
rose from her chair and seated herself on the bench where Sally
was seated.  She knew better than to say anything right away.
     "Julayla, why am I doing this?" Sally eventually asked. 
"This would all make sense if I were going to rule Mobius one
day.  But it doesn't make sense."
     There was a pause.  "What happened?" Julayla finally asked.
     "Last night, when I was in bed, I closed my eyes and tried
to remember what my old room looked like.  But I couldn't.  I
couldn't even remember the color!"  She looked at Julayla, her
eyes beginning to fill with tears.  "I'm forgetting it, Julayla! 
I'm forgetting it all!"
     Sally threw her arms around Julayla and began to cry. 
Julayla said nothing and simply held her close.  After a couple
of minutes, Sally was able to regain her composure.
     "I'm sorry," Sally sniffled.
     "Don't ever apologize for caring too deeply, Princess.  You
may go now, if you want to."
     "Thanks."
     "And tell the other children that there will be no class
tomorrow."



                                 Chapter 4


     Sonic drew the shades of the hut and looked to see that the
door was bolted.  "OK, Tails, nobody can see in.  You ready?"
     "Uh huh."
     "Go for it!"
     Tails closed his eyes and his two tails began moving in a
circular motion.  Nothing else happened for a second.  But then
Tails began slowly rising off the floor.
     "Doin' good, big guy!" Sonic said.  "Keep it up."
     Tails looked rather awkward with his legs dangling beneath him
and his rump in line with his head.  But he continued to slowly
gain altitude.  He managed to get halfway to the hut's ceiling
when, exhausted by the effort, he let himself fall into Sonic's
outstretched arms. 
     "Way to go, Tails!"
     "How far did I get?"
     "About halfway up.  You're getting better each time."
     "Cool!  When are we gonna show the others?"
     "Pretty soon.  But it's our secret until then, OK?"
     "OK.  Sonic?"
     "Yeah?"
     "How come you didn't finish your supper?"
     "I don't know; I guess I'm just tired of having the same
stuff all the time.  And I was thinking about how Uncle Chuck
used to make chili dogs.  They were great," he added as he unbolted the
door.
     "What's a chili dog?"
     "Oh yeah, I guess you never had one.  Man, are YOU missing
out!"
     "So, how did he make 'em?"
     "Well, you know what a hot dog is, right?"
     "Uh huh."
     "And you know what chili is?"
     "No."
     "Oh, right.  Well, it's sorta like a real spicy bean stew."
     "Eeeew!  Doesn't sound so good to me!"
     "Well, trust me on this one: it tastes a lot better than it
sounds!"
     Just then there was a knock at the cabin door.  That meant
one of the grown-ups doing a bed-check.  Sure enough, a second
later the door opened and Julayla looked inside.  "Is everything
all right?" she asked.
     "Uh huh," Tails replied.
     "Those aren't proper words, Miles," Julayla said.  She never
missed an opportunity to correct Tails' speech, just as she could
never bring herself to call Tails by his nickname.  She felt
nicknames to be improper, especially nicknames that were so...so
anatomical!
     "Sorry.  Everything's OK.  G'night!"
     "Good night Miles.  Good night, Sonic."
     She waited until the two boys were in their respective beds.
She then extinguished the candle that burned on a nightstand
close to the door.  Once she closed the door, however, that was
no guarantee that Sonic and Tails would go to sleep.  In fact,
most nights it was their cue to continue talking.
     "Where did Uncle Chuck live?" Tails asked in the darkness.
     "In Mobotropolis; in the city."
     "Where in the city?"
     "In a house, a place bigger than this one.  And not too far
from a park with a really neat playground.  I'll show you," Sonic
said as he pulled a flashlight from under his bed and turned it on. 
He then got out of bed and walked to a small table and chair in the
room.  He took a scrap of paper and a short pencil.
     "OK, let's say Knothole is here.  This is the Great Forest
and it comes out to just about here.  Right here's the park and
the playground in the park.  And there's a block of houses over
here.  And...THIS one, from the end, that's where Uncle Chuck's
house is."
     "Cool!  Can you show me where it is for real some day?"
     "You can count on it, big guy."
     Sonic turned out the flashlight and the two found their way
back to their beds.  "Man, this is nothing like living with Uncle
Chuck!"
     "What was it like?"
     "In some ways it was kinda fun.  It was just the two of us,
nobody else.  He worked a lot, and that was kind of a drag, but
we still spent a lot of time together.  Maybe that's why he made
chili dogs: they were real easy and it was just for the two of us.
     "I guess the worst part was cooking the chili, 'cause it
always took forever!  He had to get the spices mixed just right,
and he always used to sweat that part.  But that was cool, too,
'cause that's when Uncle Chuck and me, we'd just talk to each
other while it cooked.  Kinda like you and me are doing now."
     "What'ja talk about?"
     "Just about anything.  And Uncle Chuck never talked to me
like he was a grown-up and I was a kid--the way the grown-ups
around here do.  I think that's one of the things I miss most about
Uncle Chuck.
     "He tried talking to me about his brother a couple of times,
about the kind of life he led and stuff, but I guess I wasn't
paying all that much attention back then.  Now I wish I had. 
'Cause now I know he was talking about...about my Dad.  Only I
didn't know it and Uncle Chuck didn't want to come out and say
it."
     Sonic was about to go on, but he stopped.  Across the
darkened room he could hear the steady rhythm of Tails breathing. 
Sonic smiled.  "Sweet dreams, little bro," he whispered.

                                 Chapter 9


     "Sonic!" Sally screamed.  "Run!"
     And run he did.  Holding onto the mysterious ring, he found
himself running as he'd never run before.  He was travelling at a
fast that went "way past fast"--that was the only way he could
describe it later on.  The scenery around him was an indistinct
blur of colors.  Nothing looked normal, but it didn't make any
difference to Sonic.  He was incapable of feeling any fear.  And
there was no word at all to describe the exhilaration, the rush,
the joy he felt as he ran.  It was all of that and more.  He had
to tell somebody!  Without thinking, he turned and raced back the
way he had come.
     He returned to the spot he had left but the others weren't
there.  They were about a hundred yards up the street, sprawled
on the ground.  They were covered with dust and their hairs were
going in every direction.
     "Hey!  What happened?"
     "You are what has been happened!" Antoine sputtered.  "You
and your silly showing-off type behavior."
     "Say what?  What's he talking about, Sal?"
     "You mean you don't know?"
     "Know about what?"
     "Sonic, something happened when you ran away.  There was
this explosion and it was as if...I don't know how to describe
it...as if you were pulling the air around us after you!  It
knocked us all off our feet!  I've never felt anything like it,
not even during the worst storm!"
     "And check THIS out!" Rotor added as he examined the pieces
of what had been at least one of the SWATbots.  "These bots got
tossed around like they were nothing.  They hit walls and
lampposts and BAM!, started flying to pieces."
     "But what happened?" Sonic repeated.
     "Antoine was right the first time," Sally said in a voice
filled with awe, "YOU happened!  I don't know how you did it, but
your speed saved our lives."
     "Oui, but we are not being back in the woods yet!  What if
there are more of these terrible things on the approach?"
     Just then, they heard in the distance the warble of a siren.
That meant more SWATbots were on the way.
     "Come on!  We've got to get out of here."
     "But Uncle Chuck's..."
     "Uncle Chuck's will be the first place they look for us,
Sonic.  We'll hide in one of those row houses."
     The children ran to the end of the block, where several old
row houses stood.  The doors had fallen off long ago and the
windows were just empty rectangles.  They dashed into what had
once been someone's living room.  Sally instructed them to lay
down on the floor in the shadows of the room.  Colored lights
from a SWATbot hover unit shone through the window spaces and
danced on the bare walls.
     "Now what, Sal?" Sonic asked.
     "Wait here," Sally whispered.  I'm going to check it out."
     Sally slowly crawled toward the front door, inching along
through the dust.  Tails began to shiver with fear, but Sonic
held onto his hand.  At the doorway, Sally peered around the
corner of the doorway and down the street.  She knew that she
presented such a low profile that it would be difficult to see
her.
     "How bad is it, Sal?" Sonic whispered.  For a moment, Sally
didn't say anything.
     "It's bad, Sonic.  And it just got worse."


     "Snively!" Dr. Robotnik bellowed as he strode out of his
hover unit.  This brought his nephew and lackey out right behind
him.  "What is this place?  It looks familiar."
     "This used to be the workshop of Sir Charles Hedgehog."
     "Ah, yes.  I've sometimes thought that this place hadn't
yielded up all its secrets.  And where are the SWATbots who are
supposed to be patrolling this sector?"
     "It appears that something happened to them just before they
went offline," he said as he began picking up some of the bot
debris.  "I can retrieve their black boxes if you like, and...."
     "Don't waste my time with that!  Something happened to those
SWATbots, and it happened to them here.  Bring in the SWATbots
from the adjoining two sectors: I want a house-by-house search of
this street!"
     "At once, Sir!" Snively said before disappearing back into
the hover unit.



                                Chapter 10


     "We're dead!" Bunnie began to whimper.
     "Stop it, Bunnie!" Sally whispered, for she had rejoined the
others.  "We can get out of this."
     "You got a plan?" Sonic asked.
     "As a matter of fact, I do.  The Willow Tree Diversion."
     "Time out, Sal!" Sonic whispered.  "This ain't no game!"
     "Sonic, that's what I wanted to tell you!  Look out the
window."
     Sonic edged toward the window, keeping to the shadows of the
room.  Sally stayed next to him.
     "Isn't the street from here to Uncle Chuck's workshop about
the same size as the southern meadow?"
     "Yeah, sort of."
     "And the door is exactly where the willow tree stands."
     "Hey, yeah!  And that mailbox is about where the old stump
is!"
     "That's what Julayla was trying to show me: that I've been
rebuilding Mobotropolis all along, carrying it in my mind.  Even
when we were playing Capture The Flag, it was our way of
practicing to take Mobotropolis back.  And now that we're here,
we just have to remember how we practiced it."
     "You think this'll work, Sal?" Rotor asked.
     "With one or two modifications, it should work perfectly. 
Sonic, check to see if the alley behind these houses is clear. 
Bunnie and Antoine, you'll be running the play."
     "Can I help too, Aunt Sally?"
     "You bet, Tails!" Sonic said.
     "Sonic, he's too young to be taking chances like that!"
     "News flash, Sal: we're ALL too young!  Besides, we've been
working on a little...surprise."

     "Ah, here come my SWATbots now," Robotnik said as two hover
units landed.  Their doors opened and two SWATbots emerged from
each craft.
     "Snively!"
     "Yes, sir."
     "Deploy the SWATbots along both sides of this street, two to
a block.  Have them search every...."
     Robotnik's instructions were interrupted as he looked down
what he thought was a deserted street.  Something moved.  It
was small, about the size of a young fox, and it moved fast.  It
darted out of a doorway and then darted into another one just a
few feet down the street.
     "Did you see that, Snively?"
     "Yes, sir."
     "Then send the SWATbots after it!"
     "At once, sir."
     But before Snively could do so, another figure -- this one
more like a young rabbit -- emerged from yet another doorway in
the same block of row houses.  Once more, it ran a short distance
before ducking into yet another doorway.
     "I'm...awaiting your orders, sir," Snively said with some
nervousness.
     "There appears to be more than one intruder, and they're
moving away from Sir Charles's house.  It could be..."
     Robotnik let his sentence go unfinished as the first figure 
emerged from a doorway.
     "Never mind strategy; AFTER THAT INTRUDER!"  Robotnik,
Snively and the SWATbots began to give chase on foot.
     The figure disappeared into the shadows of yet one more
doorway.  As Robotnik approached, still another figure emerged
from the last doorway.  Robotnik's eyebrows shot up in surprise. 
It was a young hedgehog, perhaps about ten years old.  The child
strode to the middle of the street, put his hands on his hips and
addressed Robotnik: "Hold it right there, Buttnik!"
     "That's 'ROBOTNIK', you impudent brat!"
     "That's what I said, 'RoBUTTnik!'"
     "I know you," he said slowly, "you're that nephew of Sir
Charles Hedgehog, the one who got away from me.  I remember you
VERY well," he said as he massaged his roboticized left arm, a
painful reminder of their first encounter.  "Where have you been
hiding?"
     "That's for me to know and you to find out.  NOT!"
     "Why you fresh-mouthed upstart!"
     "Hey, if you want a piece of me, come and get me!"
     Robotnik drew closer to the young hedgehog, who made a point
of crossing his arms and whistling nothing in particular.  He
showed no fear, and this infuriated Robotnik all the more. 
Robotnik could have been more apprehensive, but suddenly all he
could think of was settling an old score by getting his hands on
the boy.
     Robotnik wasn't ten feet from Sonic when the hedgehog yelled
out "NOW!"  Sonic looked up and Robotnik followed his gaze.
     Something was hovering in the air about 30 feet above them,
something small and tawny-colored.  It dropped a bright object
which Sonic caught in a jump.  The next thing Robotnik knew, the
air around him was swirling around and he was knocked off his
feet.  Looking to where Sonic had been, he saw that Sonic had
moved, in less than a second, the length of a city block.
     "Hey, slow poke!" Sonic taunted.  "What's the matter, time
for your beauty sleep?  You NEED one, fella!"
     Speechless with surprise and anger, Robotnik picked himself
off the ground.  Snively was doing the same.  The SWATbots that
were with them, though, lay in pieces nearby.  Robotnik
scrambled back to his hover unit.  "Get that hedgehog now,
Snively!"
     "But Sir...."
     "NO BUTS!  I want him and that ring he's carrying!"
     With Robotnik on board, Snively took off after Sonic in the
hover unit as Sonic began to lead them a merry chase.  No matter
how fast Snively drove the hovercraft, the hedgehog on foot was
always just a little bit faster.  Robotnik didn't know how the
boy did it, and he didn't care; he would have his answers when
Sonic was caught.
     Robotnik also didn't know that the moment the hover unit
left the scene, Sally and Rotor emerged from their hiding place
in one of the row houses and ran back into Uncle Chuck's
workshop.
     "Perfect, Sally!  The Willow Tree Diversion never worked
better!"
     "Let's just hope Sonic can keep from getting caught.  Now,
help me remove the power stone from this unit.  Then we can meet
the others back at the garbage dump."  She placed her hand on the
outside of the machine, then yelped and drew her hand away
quickly.
     "That hatch is red hot!  Looks like Sonic's Uncle Chuck
didn't have his coolant problem solved after all."
     "No, he DID solve it!" Rotor said with sudden realization. 
"Now I know where I've seen this before: at the bottom of the
pool back in Knothole.  He must have built a water-cooled version
and installed it in Knothole before Robotnik took over.  This must
be his prototype!" 
     "But how do we get the power stone out so we can get it back
to Knothole?"
     "The best way is to turn the machine back on.  It'll probably
overheat, malfunction and shut itself down."
     "Won't that harm the crystal?"
     "No, you don't have to worry about that."
     "Great!" Sally said as she threw the power switch on the
machine.
     "What you DO have to worry about," Rotor added, "is the
possibility of this unit exploding."
     "WHAT!?"
     "Some of those old components have gotten pretty unstable
over the years; they could act as bombs if the unit overheats."
     "Rotor, how bad could it be?"
     "The worst that can happen is it'll take out a block or two."
     "A block or...!"  Sally reached for the power switch. 
"Rotor!  The switch is jammed; I can't shut it off!!"

                                 Chapter 1

     The sun was setting on the Great Forest.  They knew they
didn't have much time left.  
     Sonic the Hedgehog didn't like all this sneaking around. 
The direct approach had always worked for him...well, almost
always...and he preferred it to stealth.  But he knew that the
objective would soon be in sight.
     A short distance away, hidden from him, Sally lay in
waiting.  For her, there was only one objective: stop Sonic at
all costs!
     Rotor and Bunnie were nearby as well, paused and waiting
for some cue.
     At the moment, Antoine was lost.
     "Why am I always to be given such unuseful directions?" he
thought to himself. "If I was not knowing for better or for
worse, I would be saying to myself that I am trying to be
avoided!"
     The light began to fail as night closed in.  The others
would have to act soon, he knew, and he intended to be in on the
action.  But it didn't help if he was lost.
     Not daring to call out and give himself away, Antoine began
slowly backing up.  There was a hint of an autumn chill in the
early evening air and the floor of the Great Forest already had a
few dead leaves which, if stepped on, could give away Antoine's
position.  As he moved back, he brushed against the trunk of a
young tree.  It bent just enough to release a branch that had
fallen from another tree overhead.  The groundfall struck just
next to Antoine.
     "Help!  Help!  It is the invasion!  We are doom-ed!"
     Out of sheer terror, Antoine ran.  It didn't matter to him
at the moment just where he was running to.  He darted straight
ahead and plunged through a bush.  As he did so, he fell to the
ground.  In his fall, he grabbed at something--a small square of
red cloth tied to a stick.
     "Antoine!" Sally yelled.
     He looked at the object in his hand.
     "I have done it?  Yes!  Yes!  I am *triomphant*!"
     "Aw, man!" Sonic groaned.  The others began to come out of
hiding.
     "Bunnie!" Sally snapped, "you were supposed to go for it!"
     "No way, Sal!"
     "Yes, way!"
     "You said Ah was supposed to run interference for you!"
     "I said ROTOR was supposed to run interference!"
     "I thought I was supposed to be guarding the flag!"
     "Some kind of guarding, if you let Antoine get it!"
     "Now waiting a minute!  Princess or non,...."
     And soon everyone was talking at once and the scene looked
like an argument among a group of ten-year-olds.
     Which was only fitting, since they WERE a group of ten-year-
olds.


                                 Chapter 2


     Few Mobians had ever heard of Knothole, and fewer still knew
its precise location.  That knowledge had been reserved for a
handful of members of the King's court.
     The idea of an alternate command post had occurred to 
King Acorn and several of his advisors during the Great War, at a
time when there was a very real threat to the safety of
Mobotropolis.  Yet with the easing of that threat, the King
appeared to lose interest in the concept.  The truth, however,
was something else again.
     He began to conceive of the proposed royal redoubt in the
peacetime role of a retreat--a protected place where he, his
family and selected members of the court could go to get a
different perspective on things or simply to relax.  Taking only
a few into his confidence, he suggested modifications in the
already-secret project.
     While the King was to be credited with the location of the
site (which he had stumbled upon in the Great Forest in his
youth while exploring), it was Sir Charles Hedgehog who had
planned the site as a base of operations, and then modified the
plans for more peaceful purposes once the tide of battle had
turned.  Truth to tell, the layout and planning of Knothole was
more to Charles's taste than the war-work that had kept him busy
and that had earned him his knighthood.
     Knothole had many things going for it even before the first
pieces of timber were joined together.  Located deep in the Great
Forest in a slight depression, it was amply covered by foliage so
as to be virtually invisible from the air.  There were several
small clearings within walking distance that could act as landing
sites for hover units.  There was farmable land close by (equally
well camouflaged) and a river ran along the site.  Access to it
through the Great Forest was almost impossible unless one was
aware of the network of trails and paths that would take one to
it.  To bring any ground vehicle to the site was impossible; it
could only be reached on foot.
     This, as much as Charles's own aesthetics, dictated that the
design for Knothole be one of rustic simplicity.  As much of the
material as possible would come from the Great Forest itself,
with some items brought to the sight (in secret) from the city. 
Work had progressed to the point where a half-dozen huts of
various sizes were finished as the Great War drew to a close.
     But then there was a new development to cope with: one that
called himself "Robotnik."
     Before his own capture, Charles had managed to arrange that
a handful of children and two adults be secreted in Knothole. 
The two adults were women, staff members of the royal household. 
Rosie, nanny for the Princess Sally Alicia, was an obvious
choice.  Sally was, after all, heir to the Mobian throne and was
a natural candidate to be hidden away in Knothole.
     The other adult had been recently retained to be Sally's
tutor: an older feline named Julayla.  She was reserved and, to
those who didn't know her, somewhat intimidating.  What was
intimidating was, in fact, her patience and circumspection. 
Unlike the open and affable Rosie, Julayla seemed at times to be
playing a perpetual chess game--sizing up moves, reviewing and
plotting strategy, seeking an overview of the situation.  She let
few have access to her mind and heart; eventually only Princess
Sally would have that distinction, and she found Julayla to be as
kind as she was wise, as tender as she was shrewd, as empathetic
as she was observant.  This complex character served as a balance
to the simple straightforwardness of Rosie.
     Not that Sally or any of the other children (who were all
friends of hers) could appreciate any of this when they first
arrived in Knothole as refugees.  For they had just seen their
families and their world destroyed.
     They were a diverse group of children, all of them about 5
years old.  Yet at first they reacted to their new situation in
the same way.  It began with a reluctance to talk about what had
happened.  The pain of watching the arrival of the SWATbots, of
seeing parents, relatives and friends being captured and turned
into soulless mechanical caricatures of what they had once been,
was too much for their young minds.  The children pushed the
scenes from their consciousness by day, only to have the memories
trouble their dreams at night.  In the beginning, the woods
around Knothole were filled in the evening with the sound of
screaming as one or another of the children found themselves
haunted by their dreams.
     As the children realized that Knothole had become for them a
safe place where Robotnik's SWATbots weren't going to intrude,
they began to display differing styles of adapting.  Rotor, a
young walrus, was thought at first to be the most serious
potential troublemaker.  He seemed most at ease when he was
destroying things.  It drove Rosie to distraction, but Julayla
counselled patience.  That patience was rewarded when, during one
trying stretch when Rotor had spent three straight days taking
things apart, he methodically made the rounds of the demolished
objects and put them all back together in less than a day's time.
In some cases, they worked better than before.  Julayla explained
that Rotor's mechanical aptitude was part of his way of coping
with the situation: demonstrating some form of mastery over a
world gone mad.  She encouraged him in his interest in things
mechanical and electronic.
     It was a different matter when dealing with Bunnie, a close
friend of Sally's and the only other girl among the children.  A
child of the southern provinces, she had no use for the
formalities and mannerisms of the royal court.  If she didn't
care for your company, she'd just as soon make a face at you than
politely tolerate you.  Yet this also gave her a free-and-easy
happiness that was delightful to behold.  She was extremely
conscious of the natural world around her, and especially so of
her own body.  The women did the best they could with Bunnie,
hoping against hope that she would grow out of some of her more
excessive behaviors by the time she began to mature.  It was with
Bunnie in mind that Rosie and Julayla declared the hut where the
two girls slept to be Off Limits to the boys.
     If Bunnie was hard to deal with because she had not been
exposed to court manners, Antoine was even harder to deal with
because he had.  The young fox was the son of a minister in the
King's diplomatic service; as a result, he had virtually from
birth been exposed to the ways of the court.  In Knothole, he
clung to those ways with a fierce tenacity, as if he had
personally been charged with safeguarding those habits and
customs even if there was no royalty.  Yet if he was loyal to
those traditions, he was also so convinced of the rightness of
his loyalty that nobody could tell him anything.  It could be
almost impossible to correct him.  In time he even refused to
correct his speech--an atrocious mangling of the language by
someone who was not a native speaker.  He would back down when he
had to, but only to the grown-ups; he stubbornly held his own
against the other children and, despite taking his share of lumps
as a result, refused to yield.  Julayla wondered if there were
any way to sift through the chaff of arrogance to isolate the
loyalty beneath.
     Of all the children, perhaps the easiest to understand was
Charles's nephew, Sonic Hedgehog, and that made him all the more
exasperating to deal with.  He was very straightforward in his
approach to life.  Unfortunately, in his quest for the immediate,
he would sooner take a shortcut than not.  It showed in his
schoolwork, for all the children had to spend their mornings in
Knothole's dining hall, which doubled as a classroom where
Julayla did the best she could with improvised materials. 
It was hard to say whose patience was put to the test more during
these sessions, Sonic's or Julayla's.  Somehow, Sonic needed a
steadying influence, and he found it in, oddly enough, a new
arrival to Knothole.
     It was when Sonic was about 7 years old that he disappeared
from Knothole one day.  This in itself was not unusual; he was
prone to making himself scarce when he didn't care for what was
happening.  Yet it was almost dusk when he returned without any
explanation as to where he had been, without apology, and with a
small child in tow.
     It was a fox cub, little more than a toddler.  Yet this fox
cub had not one, but two, tails.  Nobody knew how he could have
been born with two tails; the consensus was that he had been *in
utero* when Robotnik's systematic destruction of the planet and
his crash program of industrialization had begun to poison the
air and sky of Mobius.  The only other clue to his identity was
the name "Miles Prower" written on the inside of one of his
shoes.  
     Sonic finally admitted what had happened: on a surreptitious
journey back to Mobotropolis, he had seen a fox couple, husband
and wife, hide the cub inside a dumpster just before being
apprehended by SWATbots.  Sonic had waited until they had been
taken away, then retrieved the cub.  Sonic never admitted it in
so many words--it would not have been cool for him to do so--but
it was clear to everyone that Sonic's heart had gone out to the
little cub from the first.
     "Tails," as the fox cub came to be called, grew into an
active and happy child, apparently unscarred by any memory of
being orphaned.  He was doted on by Rosie, and treated like a
plaything on occasion by the girls.  Yet his own attentions were
on Sonic.  As he grew older he was constantly shadowing the young
hedgehog, copying his speech and his mannerisms devotedly.  The
women worried that Sonic's ego was getting quite big enough,
thank you, without Tails' hero worship.
     But of all the children, Julayla was at the moment most
concerned about Princess Sally.  She was developing in a
natural, unstudied way.  She had a sharp intellect made sharper
by study, yet she was not bookish; physically, she was strong and
agile, and at an age when she might have been physically awkward
she carried herself with grace.
     But something was beginning to change, and the change was
worrying Julayla.  She could not yet sense what exactly, but it
was becoming clear to her that a part of Sally--a very vital
part--was dying.

                                 Chapter 5

     It was just before dawn when Sally was roused from a
dreamless sleep by a knock at the cabin door.  "Who is it?" she
asked.
     "Get your cloak, Princess."  It was Julayla.
     Sally got out of bed, felt around the side of her bed for
her boots, slowly pulled them on, then walked across the hut to a
wardrobe.  Fumbling through, she found the heavy hooded cloak
that belonged to her.  She draped it over her shoulders gladly,
for the morning was cold.
     "Whuh the hoo-ha's goin' on, Sally?" Bunnie asked in a
sleepy slur of words.
     "Julayla wants me for something.  I wonder what?"
     "Homsanomuh," Bunnie mumbled as she drifted back to sleep.
     Sally stepped out of the hut, slowly closing the door behind
her.  Julayla was already dressed in a long cloak of her own. 
Without a word, she began walking to the edge of the clearing, with
Sally following close behind.
     Ordinarily, Sally wouldn't have hesitated to ask Julayla a
hundred questions: Why get up so early?  Where were they going? 
Did she bring provisions?  But there was something about
Julayla's demeanor that morning which forbade questioning --
which forbade conversation altogether.
     The two walked on for several hours.  Breakfast was taken on
the run, as Julayla and Sally ate berries and other edibles they
found along the way.  This was nothing new to Sally, for Julayla
had taught her survival skills already.
     At last, after several hours, they had circled back to a
large meadow about ten minutes walk from Knothole.  Julayla sat
down on a fallen tree trunk, and Sally sat down next to her.
     "What is this place?" Julayla asked.
     "Well," Sally began, not really sure just what Julayla was
asking, "it's a meadow.  We usually come here to play Capture the
Flag."
     "Why?"
     "I guess because it's so open.  See, if the flag were placed
at that small sapling there, or over by that stone, you'd have a
hard time getting to it without being seen."
     "Princess, when you play this game, what is it you're
after?"
     "We try to capture the flag that's held by the other team."
     "No, Princess; what is it you're REALLY after?"
     "I don't understand."
     Julayla said nothing.  She leaned back slightly and studied
a few small clouds overhead in the sky.  Sally looked too, not
knowing what she was looking at.
     "There," Julayla said at length.  "That cloud toward the
northern horizon."
     "I see it."
     "Do you see the face in it?"
     "No, I don't.  Whose face do you mean?"
     "You never met him," Julayla said as she turned to look at
Sally.  "More years ago than I care to recount, when I was only a
little older than you are now and living in our village far to
the East, I loved a boy.  Juleric, his name was.  He never sought
my heart, but I gave mine to him gladly."
     Sally listened in rapt attention.  The thought of Julayla as
a young girl in love was one she'd never entertained before.
     "He could have claimed the heart of any girl in the village.
When he chose another, it was devastating.  Yet I knew that I
would always love him, and that I would still see his face even
when he was gone."
     "You saw his face in the cloud, then?"
     "Yes.  But only because I carry his face with me.  In my
heart."  The two were silent for a short time.
     "Princess Sally, you miss your home.  I think we all
do.  And yet you still have that home."
     "I do?  Where?"
     Julayla didn't answer the question.  She just looked at
Sally and waited for the Princess to answer her own question.
     "But Julayla, what good is a memory?"
     "That I cannot answer.  You yourself will discover the
answer.  When it is time."
     "Time for what?"
     Julayla didn't answer.  Instead, she rose to her feet.
     "You must remember.  Remember everything and anything.  You
said you were worried because you could not remember your old
room, even its color.  Then remember the shape of the door or
window.  Remember the sounds you heard every day in that room. 
It will return.  And once it returns, you will understand what a
memory is good for.
     "That is your assignment: to stay here and remember.  Come
back to Knothole when you are finished, whenever that may be."  And
without another word, Julayla walked away.
     "This is ridiculous!" Sally thought.  "There's no way this
can help me!  Why should I even bother?"  Indeed, she spent the
first 20 minutes or so studiously and angrily avoiding her
"assignment."  She circled the meadow, looked at the clouds in
the sky, tried and failed to count the number of trees
surrounding the meadow, then finally as the sun climbed to its
midday height she sat at the foot of the willow.
     "This is stupid!" she said out loud.  "Remember this! 
Remember that!  It's all a bunch of..."  She was so disgusted she
was at a loss for words, but she finally came up with a phrase:
"It's all a bunch of...of moonshine on water!"
     Sally gasped.  Her eyes went wide.  She hadn't heard those
words spoken since...since she was a girl.  She had said them
while watching the delicate willow branches as they swayed in the
breeze, branches as fine as...as hair!
     Suddenly it all flooded over her.  She was young again; she
must have been only three.  She was seated on someone's lap,
looking at her own reflection in a mirror as that someone brushed
Sally's hair after her bath.  That someone was singing a song, a
lullaby, about night and the moonshine on water.
     And Sally was remembering.  She remembered that she was in
the nursery, only now she could see it all.  She saw everything
with absolute clarity and conviction.  She remembered every
sound, every scent, every color.  But most of all, she remembered
how good it felt at that very moment, to sit without a stitch of
clothing on someone's lap watching yourself in a mirror having
your hair brushed by someone singing a simple song.
     Sally's reaction was simple and straightforward: for the next
forty minutes, on and off, she cried her eyes out.  The memory had
created a joy in her she had not felt in a long time; the
realization that that joy was now lost to her was too much to bear.
     Finally, worn out from crying, she looked across the meadow
from beneath the tree.  "Anything and everything," Julayla had
said.  What else was there?
     Then she looked at the meadow itself.  It was familiar, but
in a way Sally couldn't describe.  It looked like...like the
palace garden in Mobotropolis!
     Was this what Julayla was driving at?  Had she chosen this
meadow because it was a good game field, or because of the memory
it evoked, a memory unidentified until now?
     This was getting to be too much.  Sally quickly walked away
from the willow and stepped into the Great Forest.  She took one
quick look back over her shoulder at the willow, then turned.
     And now she saw something that almost stopped her heart. 
She looked up at the trunks and branches of the trees as they
interlaced to form the protective shield that kept Knothole
hidden.  Only now it looked less and less like a covering of tree
branches and more and more like a ceiling.  The ceiling of the
Throne Room at the Palace.  And before her she thought she could
see an aged tree trunk shift into the ornate throne of the Acorn
kings.  And seated on the throne....
     "Daddy?" she heard herself say in a half-whisper.
     "What's wrong, my dear?"
     "Daddy, I...I don't know what's happening to me.  And I'm
scared."
     "I know.  I wish I could calm your fear but it's not within my
power."
     "What IS happening to me?"
     "You're growing up, my dear.  I only wish I really WAS here
to see it."  And he smiled THAT smile, the one he gave when there
was a joke that only two could share.
     "But I'm not ready yet!"
     "I know.  But there's nobody to assume the throne as Regent
until you come of age, and you no longer have the luxury of
waiting.  Whether you're ready or not, whether you like it or not,
this old throne is yours.  If you're ready to take it back.  THAT
is the point, Sally."


     When Sally awoke, it was with eyes red and swollen from crying.
She was at the base of an old tree stump, its wood long rotted with
decay.  She looked around.  The light was failing.  The sun was
low in the sky; almost night!  How long had she been asleep?  She
gathered her cloak about her and began running back toward
Knothole.
     Despite all the emotions that had overwhelmed her that day,
Sally felt no fatigue.  In fact, remembering what she had gone
through buoyed her up as nothing had before.  She had to tell
someone!
     She ran into the center of Knothole.  There appeared to be
no activity of any kind.  She quickly walked to the cabin she
shared with Bunnie.  "Bunnie?" she called out as she opened the
door.
     No sooner had Sally entered the hut than the door slammed
shut behind her.  Sally turned, and could see Bunnie in the dim
light.
     "Bunnie, I've got to tell you what...."
     But before she could say anything else, Bunnie placed her
hand across Sally's mouth as if to silence her.  Sally simply
batted it away.
     "Bunnie, what's your problem?"
     "Tails is missing, THAT'S mah problem!"



                                 Chapter 6


     As Sally's eyes became adjusted to the dark, she could see
that Sonic, Rotor and Antoine were in the room with them.  It was
a major infraction for ANY of the boys to be in the girls' hut
after curfew, but that fact seemed to pale in comparison to
Bunnie's news.  "When did it happen?" Sally asked.
     "We don't know.  Last anyone saw of Tails, he was sittin'
next to Sonic at dinner.  He left the table and never came back. 
Whenever Rosie or Julayla asked about him we told them that he
was with someone else who wasn't there at the time--Sonic or Rotor
or someone.  I think we managed to fool them through bedcheck,
but we still don't know what happened to the little darlin'!"
     "I even took a quick dip in the river," Rotor added.  "At
least we know he didn't fall in."
     "Sonic, did you say anything to Tails that might have gotten
him mad or...?"
     "No way, Sal!  I was just, you know, talking to him."  
     "What did you say, exactly?"
     "Not much, just the usual, like how I was getting tired of
the same old thing over and over for meals and how much I missed
Uncle Chuck's chili dogs and...oh boy."
     "Sonique, what is meaning this 'oh boy'?"
     "Well...."  
     "Sonic, what are you trying to say?"
     "It's probably nothing, Sal, but...well, last night I was
talking to him about Uncle Chuck's chili dogs and how he used to
make 'em and...."
     "Sonic, please!  I don't want to hear any more about chili
dogs!  Besides, it's not like Tails knows the way to Uncle
Chuck's."
     "Well...."  And so Sonic told the others of their conversation the
night before.
     "Sonic, you didn't!  Why would you tell Tails where Uncle
Chuck's house used to be?"
     "How'd I know he'd go looking for it?"
     "He's four years old!!  Four-year-olds do things like that! 
Smart move, Sonic!  He's probably lost somewhere in the Great
Forest right now."
     "He is not.  I...."
     "There's more?"
     "I...sort of kind of drew him a map."
     "And he's got it?"
     "I can't find it anywhere; he MUST have taken it with him."
     "Perfect!  You gave him directions to get to Robotnik!  And
if Tails get caught by any SWATbots, they'll have directions to
get to us!"
     "Relax!  I'll just go get him."
     "Sonic, you can't just go walking back to Robotropolis
and...."
     "Who says I can't?"
     It looked like the two of them were two seconds away from a
fight.  That would REALLY have brought out the grown-ups. 
Instead, Sally lowered her voice.  But while she spoke calmly,
she continued to look Sonic in the eye.  "What is it, really?"
     "I..." Sonic hesitated.  "Well, it's just that I promised
Rosie that I'd look after Tails all day today.  And...and I
promised her I wouldn't let her down.
     "Look, Sal, we both know the grown-ups think I'm a loser,
some kind of screw-up.  Just 'cause I don't do well in school or
I don't help out as much as they say I'm supposed to.  I WANTED
to show them I was good at SOMETHING, but...."  Sonic turned away
from her and the rest of the children.
     "It's OK," Sally said in a whisper, placing her hand on his
shoulder.  "We'll look for him together.  All of us."
     "Sal, you weren't even here when...."
     "That doesn't make any difference, Sonic.  I don't want to
see anything happen to him, either."
     "But Princess," Antoine asked with a tremor in his voice,
"for the all of us to be going to that terrible place...."
     "Fine.  We'll only take volunteers, then.  All those who
care about Tails, raise your hand.  OK, it's unanimous.  Get your
cloaks--we're leaving."

                                Chapter 11

     "Don't lose him, Snively!  I must have him!!"
     "Easy for you to say," Snively muttered under his breath,
"you're not driving."
     Sonic was moving with a speed and agility he had never known
before.  Somehow, though, it all seemed so natural -- as if he
had been born to do the impossible.
     Sonic was able to keep up a grueling pace and not feel any
fatigue.  He zigged and zagged down streets and up alleys,
doubled back and slipped under conduits and bridges.  He didn't
want to slow down, not only because it might have meant his
capture, but also because it felt so good to run.
     Snively, however, managed to stay on the young hedgehog's
trail.  He took some corners a little too sharply and he and
Robotnik got knocked about in the process.  Robotnik, however,
kept his attention on the blue blur visible ahead of them.
     "Whoa, this looks interesting," Sonic thought as he found
himself heading down a side street which turned into a dead end. 
An enormous skyscraper marked the end of the street.
     "We have him now, Snively!  He's got nowhere else to go!"
     "Nowhere except up, Sir.  Look!"
     Sure enough, Sonic wasn't about to let a little thing like a
building stand in his way.  He was on a roll and he just kept on
rolling.  He was running up the side of the building, propelled
by momentum.  Snively put the hover unit into a climb in the nick
of time.
     "After him, after him!  If that ring can enable him to do
THAT...."
     Sonic was halfway up the building when he looked over his
shoulder.  Robotnik was keeping pace.  "Man, this is getting
boring!" he thought.
     In the blink of an eye, Sonic reversed directions and was
running down the side of the building.  He blew Robotnik a
raspberry as he passed the hover unit.  Snively quickly turned it
around.
     "We're gaining, Snively!"
     Indeed, they were closing in on Sonic.  They were almost on
top of him.
     It was then, about fifty feet from the ground, that Sonic
decided that he had better stop coasting and do some serious
running.  He pounded ahead, reached the ground and streaked away.
The hover unit, however, was in virtual free fall.
     "Pull up, Snively!  PULL UP!!"
     Snively worked the controls, but the underside of the hover
unit scraped the street.  That was enough to sent the hover unit
tumbling with all the aerodynamics of a stone skipping across a
pond.  By the time the hover unit came to rest its shell was
pocked and torn, its windows were smashed, and its contents badly
shaken.
     "Snively," Robotnik panted.
     "Y-yes, Sir?"
     "I have decided that I am going to make it one of the
supreme goals of my life to GET THAT HEDGEHOG!"
     Snively rolled his eyes.  This did NOT sound like a
worthwhile job description.


     Sonic raced back to the dump, where the others were gathered
at their pre-arranged rendezvous point: the excavated remains of
the slide.  "Man, you shoulda seen ol' Buttnik eat my dust!  I
was..."
     "Sonic, not now!" Sally cut him off.  "Get down!"  It was
only then that Sonic noticed that the others were lying prone on
the ground.
     "Nap time already?" 
     "Sonic, Rotor thinks that that ring unit is going to blow
up!"
     "Say what?"
     "It's overheating and going unstable," Rotor added.  I
couldn't get the power stone out and..."
     "You mean that stone thingie is still in there?"
     "Of course, we...."
     "Chill, guys."  And before anyone could say or do anything,
Sonic took off toward Uncle Chuck's.
     "What are we to be doing?"
     "What CAN we do, Antoine?" Sally asked.  "Sonic's gotten too
fast for...."
     Anything else Sally might have said was drowned out by a
deafening roar as the power ring unit exploded.  In moments, the
home of Sir Charles Hedgehog was engulfed in flames.  The
children stared at it silently.
     "Sonic?" Tails said in a hesitant voice.
     "That's my name, don't wear it out!"
     The children turned.  There standing behind them, the power
stone on the ground at his feet, was Sonic.  Tails yelped and
threw his arms around Sonic's neck.
     "Sonic!?  How did you...?"
     "No biggie, Sal.  I just yanked it out of there real fast. 
And from now on, "fast" is my middle name!"
     "This is what I was to be saying," Antoine sputtered, "about
your unresponsibility and your utter fuelishness and your...."
     Antoine never got to finish his sentence as Sally touched
him on the shoulder.  For now they could all see that Sonic's
demeanor had changed.  He might have been careless when it came
to putting his life on the line, but it was a more subdued Sonic
who watched his Uncle Chuck's house -- the only home he had ever
known before Knothole -- being consumed by fire.  They watched
for several silent seconds.
     "Come on," Sonic said quietly.  "Let's go home."

     The children were subdued and apprehensive as they entered
the Great Forest.  But the farther they made their way, the
louder and more animatedly they talked about what they had just
done.  All except Tails who quickly succumbed to fatigue.  Sonic
carried the cub in his arms the rest of the way back to Knothole.
     They also speculated as to what would happen to them if
Rosie or Julayla ever found out.  They each thought that they
would be severely punished if either of the grown-ups found out
about their experience, but they also all agreed that any
punishment would be totally worth it.
     It was about two hours before dawn as the children neared
Knothole.  As they recognized that they were getting closer to
Knothole, the children fell silent.  Their luck had held in that
they were able to get away undetected.  If they could just get
back and into bed before Rosie or Julayla learned of it, they
would be home free.
     They edged toward the clearing.  So far, so good: there were
no lights on in any of the cabins.  The children all made their
way into the nearest cabin, which was Sonic's and Tails'.
     "How's Tails doing, Sonic?" Sally whispered.
     "The big guy's still asleep."
     "Good."
     "Ah can't see a thing, Sal.  Think we can take a chance on
lightin' a candle?"
     No sooner had she whispered these words than there was a
hiss and a burst of light as someone at the far end of the room
struck a match.  The children froze as its light momentarily
dimmed, then the light grew stronger as someone had lit a candle
with it.  That someone was Julayla.  She calmly blew out the
match; the children each caught the smell of burnt sulfur. 
Julayla stood up.
     "Julayla, I..." Sally began.  Julayla raised her hand.
     "There'll be time enough for talk in the morning," she said
quietly, as she took the sleeping Tails in her arms and began
putting him to bed.  Rotor, Antoine and the girls silently
drifted away.  Sonic wanted to say something to Julayla, but
couldn't.  Julayla didn't say anything to Sonic as she let the
cabin.  That silent reproach hurt Sonic almost as much as
watching his old home go up in flames.




                                Chapter 12

     Despite the early hour at which the children had gone to
bed, nobody slept in that morning.  They all gathered in front of
the dining hall but didn't go in, except for Tails.  He was as
buoyant as ever as he raced from his hut.  He even flew half
the distance to the dining hall, since he figured that the secret
was out.
     "Well, SOMEONE's in a good mood," Bunnie observed gloomily.
     "What to you think they'll do to us?" Rotor asked.
     "I don't know," Sally said.
     "Maybe it won't be so bad," Sonic suggested.
     "Right, Sonic," Sally shot back, "we only broke every rule
in the book and then some!  Well, let's get this over with," she
added as she walked toward the door.
     As they entered the dining hall, Tails was already seated at
a table with Julayla.  Rotor volunteered to walk as close to
their table as possible, in order to hear what was being said. 
He heard Tails happily recounting the events of the previous
evening in one long run-on sentence:
     "...and then Sonic seen us when he came outside and Sally
said for him to run so he runned away but real real fast and...."
     "So, how is it?" Bunnie asked.
     "It's bad, guys," Rotor said as he sat down at the table
with the others.  "I was listening to Tails just now.  He's
telling Julayla everything that happened last night."
     "How's Julayla taking it?" Sally asked.
     "Tails was making all kinds of grammatical errors, but
Julayla didn't even stop and correct him once!"  He put his head
in his hands.  "That's it: we're toast!"
     "How are you to be thinking of food at the time like this?"
     Sally was in no mood to say anything to Antoine just then,
because they saw Julayla walking toward them.
     "Miles has told me what happened last night.  Does anyone
wish to add anything?"
     "I do," Sally said, her head bowed.  "We should have trusted
you, and told you and Rosie that Tails was missing."
     "But Sal," Sonic immediately said, "they'd have grounded us
and we wouldn't have gotten Tails back."
     "Perhaps, perhaps not," Julayla said calmly.  "But now
you'll never know, will you?"
     This was enough to overwhelm Sonic's attempt at argument. 
While he and the other children contemplated this reply, Julayla
went to the side cupboard where the school supplies were kept. 
She returned with paper and writing instruments.  Sonic and the
others anticipated that they'd each have to write something long
and chastening one hundred times.  Just for starters.  As the
children passed the materials around to each other, Julayla began
unfolding large old documents: they were maps of Mobotropolis.   
     "I want each of you to study the maps that I've spread out
on the table.  Write out any changes in the city that you
noticed last night.  Be as detailed as possible.  You'll probably
want to compare notes with each other."
     "What kind of crazy punishment is THIS?" Sonic whispered to
Sally.
     "This is not your punishment, Sonic.  You've already brought
a very severe punishment upon yourselves.  Until yesterday,
Robotnik had probably forgotten all about you; today, he knows
better and you've given him a reason to look for you.  Yesterday
you were children playing a game; as of today, you are in a war. 
There is no worse punishment that I or anyone else could possibly
inflict."
     The children looked at each other silently.  Bunnie looked
at Sally and silently mouthed the word "war."
     "It'll be OK, Bunnie, as long as we work together," she said
softly.  Then, in a louder voice she spoke to the others, "OK,
where did the trash heap begin?  We know that it covered all of
the playground where this park used to be...."
     "Sally," Julayla added, "your afternoon lessons will be held
in my hut."
    

     The children waited with anticipation around the pool just
outside Knothole.  Everyone, that is, except Rotor, who was
somewhere under the water.
     With the exception of Rotor, none of the children
particularly cared for the water.  They could swim if they had
to, but there were more at home on the land.  Especially Sonic,
who couldn't swim a stroke.
     Rotor suddenly broke the surface, getting a breath of air. 
The others shook the water from themselves.
     "Stone's in, everybody!  The machine started right up!  If
it's the same as the machine in Uncle Chuck's workshop it should
be producing a power ring any time now."
     As the other children gathered as close to the edge of the
pool as they dared, Julayla touched Sally on the shoulder.  The
two of them moved away from the group and walked toward Julayla's
hut.
     Once inside, Julayla began writing something on a scrap of
paper which she then handed to Sally.
     "Commit this to memory.  When you have done so, burn it. 
Leave no trace."
     "Why?  What is this?"
     "It is a list of four settlements of refugees from
Mobotropolis located in various parts of the Great Forest.  These
aren't their true locations: only the locations of drop sites
where we leave the messages by which we communicate with each
other.  We wanted to keep from jeopardizing all of the
settlements, so we devised this system.  It's a good thing we
did; one settlement, Birchwood, was discovered by SWATbots the
other day and its inhabitants scattered."
     "There are others!?  But why...?"
     "Why were you not told?  None knew of the existence of the
other camps except for one member of each, and even they did not
know the precise location of the others."
     "But what were they doing?"
     "Surviving.  Living in hiding.  Living in fear.  And
waiting."
     "Waiting for what?"
     "Waiting for WHOM is more like it.  They have no one to
guide them, no one to formulate strategy and carry it out.  I
knew that the day would come when there would be a sign, a sign
that we can begin to hope again.  A sign that the time had come
to begin resisting Robotnik.  Your raid on Robotropolis last
night was reckless and uncoordinated, but it was also the sign
that I and the others had been waiting for.  It was the sign that
we finally have a leader amongst us."
     Julayla walked over to Sally and placed her hands on the
girl's shoulders.  Things got very still and cold inside the hut.
     Suddenly they heard the sound of cheering outside.  The
machinery at the bottom of the pool had indeed produced a power
ring.  With ring in hand, Sonic was tearing up the turf of
Knothole.  He was just a blur as he streaked around and between
the buildings.  And as he ran, the other children began chanting
his name: "So-NIC!  So-NIC!  So-NIC!  So-NIC!"
     Sally and Julayla watched Sonic's dashing about.  Then Sally
spoke, with a startling bitterness in her voice: "Yes, you've got
your leader...." She said no more, choked back a sob, then ran
from the hut.  She ran across Sonic's path, and the sight managed
to bring the hedgehog to a halt.
     "Chill, guys," he said to the others, "I'll be right back."
     Sonic walked around the corner of a hut.  He saw Sally
seated on a log, her face buried in her hands and her shoulders
heaving.  He quietly sat down a little way from her.
     Sally stopped crying and tried to adopt a formal appearance.
"Tired of your adoring fans already?" she asked sarcastically.
     "Hey, Sal, you got too much class for that kind of a cheap
shot."
     "I'm sorry," she sniffled.  "I...I guess I'm just scared."
     "Scared of what?"     
     "Sonic, everything's changed now!  Julayla expects me to
start acting like some kind of leader...and I don't know if I
can."
     "What're you talking about, Sal?  We found Tails, got Uncle
Chuck's power ring machine working, AND got in and out of
Robotropolis in one piece!  And we did it as a team, thanks to
you.  All I did was run fast.  You're a GREAT leader!"
     "But will the other Mobians feel that way?"
     "Say what?"  So Sally told Sonic about the other camps
hidden in the Great Forest.
     "Sonic we're talking about grown-ups here!  Even if I am the
heir to the throne, I'm still just a kid.  Do you really think
any grown-up would take orders from a ten-year-old girl?"
     "I would."
     Sonic said it so simply and sincerely that it surprised both
of them.  For several moments all the two of them could do was
look at each other.  For Sonic, it was as if he were looking at
someone he'd never known before.  His hand slowly reached over
and took hold of hers...
     Suddenly the stillness of the moment was broken by a chorus
of hoots and whistles.  Bunnie, Rotor, Antoine and Tails were
looking at them from around the corner of one of the huts.  
     "Aw, man!  Knock it off, you guys!"
     Sonic's face grew bright red, and Sally adopted that studied
indifference which children sometimes mistake for maturity.  And
then the other four children began a traditional Mobian chant. 
It was a chant that further embarrassed Sonic and annoyed Sally,
though there was a secret part of her that was glad to hear it. 
It began:
     "Sonic and Sally sittin' in a tree...."


                                  THE END

                                 Chapter 7

     There had once been only a narrow wooded strip between the
place where the Great Forest and the city of Mobotropolis met. 
Only a portion of the strip remained; the rest had been cleared and
just beyond that clearing were acres of garbage.  The children
stood in the shadows of the trees at the edge of the wood.  Ahead
of them the once-beautiful city of Mobotropolis was lit by electric
lamps that cut unnaturally through the polluted air.
     "Sally, girl, this is just awful!" Bunnie whispered.
     "I know, Bunnie.  Robotnik's ruined the whole city."
     "I'm talkin' 'bout my ears--the stuff in the air's makin'
'em wilt!"
     "They'll be OK, Bunnie, but Tails is what matters now."
     "How come it's so warm, Sally?" Rotor asked.  "It was cooler
in the forest."
     "All the pollution in the air must be trapping the heat from
the city.  We'd better leave our cloaks here; besides, they might
get in the way.  OK, Sonic, how do we get to Uncle Chuck's?"
     "How should I know?"
     "You said you knew the way!"
     "Sal, look around!  Too much has changed!  I always used to
know my way to Uncle Chuck's from the playground in the park. 
I'd climb to the top of the slide in the park, and I could see
Uncle Chuck's house from there.  With all this garbage here I don't
think I can even FIND the park!"
     "We can and we will, Sonic.  For Tails' sake.  Now come on,
we've got to try and find it."
     The children walked cautiously over and around mountains of
refuse for about ten minutes.  Finally, Sally stopped.
     "What's up, Sal?"
     "I don't know where we are, Sonic.  I thought we'd be in the
park's playground by now, but I don't see it anywhere."
     "You mean we're lost?"
     "Not yet, Bunnie; I just need to get my bearings somehow. 
Just give me a minute to think."
     "What if we ain't got a minute, Sally-girl?  Them SWATbots
could be on their way here right now!"
     But Sally was already studying the landscape.  She started
to walk toward the city, hesitated, then looked to her feet. 
Kneeling, she began to clear away the debris.  The others gather
round her.
     "What's up, Sal?" Sonic asked.
     "This pipe, with what looks like some kind of clamps on it. 
I think I should know what this is."
     "What're you talkin' about?"
     "Julayla told me to remember, even the smallest things about
Mobotropolis.  Help me clear off this pipe."
     The children did.  Soon, the top of the pipe was exposed.
     "Hmmm.  There are six clamps of some kind.  That could also
mean...Oh my gosh!"
     "Sal, what is it?"
     "Sonic, don't you see what this is?" Sally asked excitedly.
     "Uh...."
     "This pipe...it's the top of the swing set!"
     "Come again?"
     "The swing set!  Remember how it had three swings on it. 
That meant it had six chains holding the seats.  These clamps
must be the ones that held the chains in place!"
     "I was gonna say that."
     "Then the park...." Rotor began.
     "Exactly.  We've been right all along.  The park is here,
under all this garbage."
     The children were silent for a moment.
     "Man, this is the pits!" Rotor said.  "It's bad enough
Robotnik had to roboticize everybody, but then he buries the
playground under tons of garbage!"
     Bunnie started crying: "I want to go home!"
     "Bunnie," Sally said gently but firmly as she grabbed her
friend by the shoulders, "you ARE home.  This city, this whole
world, used to BE our home!  And one of these days we're going to
take it back!"
     "Really?" she sniffled.
     "Really.  But right now we've got work to do.  Now if this
is the swing set, then the slide should be somewhere over there!"
     Sally ran off to her left, the others following closely. 
She began scratching at the garbage heap again.
     "What're we lookin' for, Sally-girl?"
     "The top of the slide: two curving metal tubes."  The others
began scrounging as well.  In less than a minute:
     "Found 'em!"
     Rotor had indeed found the handrails of the disused slide. 
Sally dug some more until she uncovered the well-worn metal plate
that was the top of the slide.
     "OK, Sonic.  Stand here and close your eyes."
     "Then what?"
     "Then see if you can see Uncle Chuck's house."
     "With my eyes closed?"
     "In your mind, with your heart, your imagination!  Now come
on, we don't have all night!"
     Sonic was taller than he had been the last time he was on
the slide, and he had to bend his knees slightly to take hold of
the railings.  Once he did, however, it all flooded over him.  He
no sooner closed his eyes and held onto the railing than he
gasped, opened his eyes, raised his arm and pointed ahead of him.
     "That's the way to Uncle Chuck's."
     Ahead of them, just beyond where the trash stopped, was a
block of modest homes, homes long deserted.  Some of them were
already partially buried by the garbage.  "Which one is it?"
Sally asked.
     "That one: fourth from the corner, facing the next street."
     "Great work, Sonic!  Let's go."  The children began walking
toward the houses.
     "Sal, it was like I really COULD see it!  That was way past
cool!  But what if Tails isn't there?"
     That was the one thing Sally hadn't allowed herself to think
about.   "Let's just search your Uncle Chuck's house first," was
all she said.
     
     



                                 Chapter 8


     The modest house which had once been the home and workshop
of Sir Charles Hedgehog was deserted.  Unlike the other houses,
it showed signs of having been thoroughly ransacked.  The door
appeared to have been torn off its hinges, and almost every window
had been smashed.  Ducking down an alley, the children made their
way to the small workshop attached to the back of the house.
     The inside of the workshop resembled the garbage dump the
children had just left.  Papers and components littered the floor. 
Dust and grit lay heavy on smashed glass and scattered pieces of
paper.  
     "Oh my gosh," Sally whispered, "this place looks like someone
fought a war in here!"
     "It is looking like the SWATbots, they destructioned
everything."
     "Looks like they haven't been back since.  Maybe they'll leave
us in peace while we look for...Are you OK, Sonic?"
     "Back off!  It's just...dusty in here, that's all."
     It WAS dusty inside the workshop, but Sally didn't see any
of the others rubbing their eyes the way she saw Sonic rubbing
his.  She backed off.
     "What is your planning, Princess?"
     "We can't call out for Tails; the SWATbots might hear us. 
Look at the floor and see if you can find any footprints; it so
dusty in here he's bound to have left some if he came this way."
     "Got it, Sal.  Rotor, you and me will check out the store
room."
     Sonic and Rotor made their way to a room just off the
workshop.  It may have been a storeroom but it was no mere closet;
it was at least half the size of the workshop.  Mechanical
components lay just about everywhere.
     "Oh, wow!  Look at this capacitor unit!  Sonic, your Uncle
Chuck had some great stuff!!"
     "This is all junk, Rotor!"
     "Not after I get through with it.  I gotta take this back
with us!"
     "That stuff hasn't worked in who knows how long."
     "C'mon, Sonic.  I've fixed TOASTERS that were in worse shape
than this!"
     "Worry about your toasters later, man, right now we gotta
look for Tails!"
     "OK, Sonic, OK.  But why do I get the feeling I've seen THIS
thing before?"  Rotor wondered out loud as he looked at a large
box-like mechanism in the center of the room.
     "Because it is looking like every other contraptionation you
have builded in our hut," Antoine said pointedly.  He had found no
trace of Tails and had gone to the store room to tell Rotor and
Sonic.  Sally and Bunnie were right behind him.
     "I don't think so, Ant.  There's just something...."  At a
loss for words, Rotor tapped the side of the machine.  Immediately,
there was another sound, one that brought all other sound and
movement to a halt:
     "Sonic?  Where are you?"
     It was Tails.
     "Yeah, it's me!  Where are you, big guy?"
     "I felled in here.  I can't find my way out."
     "Hang on, honey," Sally said, as she felt her heart start
beating again, "we'll find the door.  How did you get in there?"
     "I finded the place just like Sonic's map said, but I
couldn't find where the chili dogs were.  So I opened the door
and looked in here, but it closed and I can't open it.  I guess I
felled asleep."
     "OK, Tails, where was the door?"
     "On this side."
     "Tap on the side for me."
     In a second the others heard Tails tapping on the casing.  
     "Rotor, can you get inside there?"
     "Give me a second to...wait, I think this is an access
plate.  If I can find where to push..."
     The top of the plate moved in toward the inside of the
machine.  The foot of the plate was apparently hinged, and a
spring at the top was what must have trapped Tails inside and
prevented him from opening it.
     "You OK, Tails?" Sonic asked.
     "Uh-huh.  But I can't get out."
     "Tails," Sally called to him, "you'll have to move away from
the plate."
     "The what?"
     "The...the thing that Rotor's pushing on."
     "It's too tight!"
     "Tails, you have to try!"
     "I can't hold this open by myself.  The spring's too tight!  Antoine,
get over here and lean."
     "Sonic, can you reach around them and pull Tails out of
there?"
     "I'll try, Sal."
     Rotor and Antoine pressed against the access plate.  It
gave, but at the same time they heard a small yelp from inside
the machine.
     "You OK, Tails?" Sonic called out.
     "The door bit me!"
     "Stand to the side of the door, honey," Sally called to him,
"as far as you can go."
     After a second, Rotor and Antoine resumed pushing.  Then, in
the room's dim light, Sally made out a shape emerging from the
machine: a waving hand.
     "I see you, Tails!  Hang in there.  Sonic, grab on!"
     It took about a minute more of pushing and fidgeting, of
grabbing and having to let go, but eventually Tails was out of
the machine with Sonic's arms around him.  Freed of his prison, he
started to whimper.
     "Hey, everything's cool, big guy.  We got you out of there."
     "He must have leaned against that access plate just enough
to fall inside," Sally guessed.  She then cradled the cub's face
in her hands.  "But I'm just so glad we found...."  She paused.
     "What's up, Sal?"
     "Tails, where's the map Sonic gave you last night?"
     "Right here," he said, holding up a crumpled piece of paper.
     "Tails, honey, we have to get rid of it right now."
     "But it's mine!  Sonic made it for me!"
     "Better do what she says, little bro, or else Robotnik might
find it.  For me, OK?" Sonic added as Tails showed signs of
hesitation.
     "Well, OK," Tails said as he handed Sally the paper.
     "Now let's burn this before....  Oh no."
     "Now what?"
     "Sonic, this isn't your map.  Tails must have dropped it
inside the machine and picked this up instead."
     "But what is it?"
     "I don't know; it's too dark to read.  Rotor and Antoine,
see if you can feel around for that map inside the machine.  The
rest of us will be in the kitchen; maybe we can find some matches
in there."
     "Here we are going against," Antoine sighed.
     While Rotor and Antoine once more did battle with the access
plate, the others followed Sonic into the kitchen of Uncle
Chuck's house.  The room appeared orderly, though dusty.
     "Looks like they didn't bother searching this room," Sally
observed.  "Robotnik must have figured that the good stuff was in
the workshop."
     "Yeah, well he never tasted one of Uncle Chuck's...."
     "Sonic, DON'T say it!"
     "What's the matter, you don't like chili dogs?"
     "No, it's just that I haven't had anything to eat since
breakfast and I'm starving!"
     "Well, somethin' 'round here's killin' MAH appetite!" Bunnie
said, her nose wrinkling.  "What in the hoo-ha IS that?"
     "Got the map, Sonic!" Rotor said as he walked into the
kitchen.  Antoine followed close behind, muttering and brushing
the dirt from his coat.
     "Hey, Sal, I found a candle and some matches in this
drawer."
     "Don't light it yet, Sonic!  Make sure the window shades are
down; we don't want to be seen."  After a few seconds of pulling
down what was left of the shades, Sally dared to light the
candle.
     "OK, here's the map.  First things first, we'd better burn
this.  What's that other piece of paper, Sonic?"
     There was a long pause.
     "I don't know, but it's got Uncle Chuck's writing on it." 
Sonic handed the paper to Sally.
     "Looks like random notes:
     COOLANT PROBLEM SOLVED
     SECURE POWER SOURCE
     EXTRA ONIONS."
     "'Extra onions?'" Rotor asked.
     "Yeah, that's how Uncle Chuck liked his chil...his you-know-
whats: with extra onions."
     "THAT'S what Ah'm smellin'!"
     "What, Bunnie?"
     The children did a quick search of the kitchen and located
several bins, one of which was labeled ONIONS.  Sally opened it.
     "EEEEEEEEEWW!  Close it, Sally girl!"  Immediately Sally 
replaced the lid.
     "Man, I didn't know ANYTHING could smell THAT bad!"
     "We've got to get rid of those things; they're rotten!"
     Using a ruler from the workshop, Sally scooped out the
remains of a couple of thoroughly rotted onions.  She pitched
them out of a broken window.
     "Well," Sonic said, "that takes care of the bad ones.  At
least the other onions in the bin looked OK."
     "Sonic," Sally asked, "when's the last time you heard of
onions staying fresh for five years?"
     The children looked at each other in silence, then started
grabbing at the onions in the bin.
     "Sacre bleu cheeze.  They are the *plastique*!"
     "I don't get it, Sal.  Why would Uncle Chuck keep plastic
onions in this bin?"
     "Maybe there's something about the bin itself.  Help me
empty it."
     In a matter of seconds the children had dumped all the
plastic onions onto the floor.
     "Now what, Sal?"
     "Let me think."  She spent several seconds looking into the
empty bin.  She then opened the bin next to it, one marked
POTATOES.  It was empty as well.
     "Looks like we struck out, Sal."
     "Not yet.  Let me try something."
     Sally reached into the onion bin until her palm rested flat
on the bottom.  The top of the bin went just past her elbow. 
When she tried the same thing with the potato bin, however, the
top of the bin came up almost to her armpit.
     "I knew it!  This bin must have a false bottom!  Can you get
me a knife?"  Sonic opened a drawer and produced a long kitchen
knife.  Sally began using it on the edge of the bottom of the
bin.  It slid between the bottom and the side wall easily, and
Sally worked the bottom of the bin loose.
     The children backed away in awe.  Underneath the false
bottom lay a large yellow, faceted stone, about as big as Sally's
head.  It appeared to glow from within.
     "Oh my gosh!  This looks like a power stone."
     "A what?"
     "A power stone.  It's a source of tremendous energy.  Looks
like this was where Uncle Chuck kept it hidden.  That may be what
Uncle Chuck's note meant by 'SECURE POWER SOURCE.'  If Robotnik
had gotten hold of this...."
     "So what do we do, take it back to Knothole?"
     "You know, Sally," Rotor said, "I think that stone will fit
into the top of that machine in the storeroom."
     "Rotor, this is no time to experiment; we've got to get out
of here!"
     "But what if that contraption was something important?  What
if it was something that could be used against Robotnik?"
     "Like what?"
     "Like...I don't know; we have to turn it on."
     "Look, we'll see if the stone fits; then we'll HAVE to
leave!"
     The stone, though sizable, was surprisingly light in weight.
Rotor carried it back into the storeroom, with the others following
him.
     "Why are you giving to him this indulgence?" Antoine
whispered to Sally.
     "I don't know; just a feeling I have.  I think this thing IS
important, somehow."
     Rotor guessed correctly that an aperture near the top of the
machine would accommodate the stone.  After fitting it in, Rotor
didn't even bother saying anything to Sally, but simply turned on
what appeared to be the power switch.
     At first nothing happened.  Then a low humming filled the
air.  Suddenly, there was a brilliant flash as a metallic ring,
shining like gold and light, shot up from the top of the machine,
ricochetted off the ceiling, and landed with a clang at Sonic's
feet.  Rotor reached over and turned off the power switch.  At
the same time something else fell to the ground, something that
had been ejected from the machine just behind the ring.  Sally
picked it up.
     "Sonic, it's an envelope.  With your name on it!"
     "Were you hearing that?" Antoine whispered.
     "Come on, 'Twan, let's go see if this house is haunted,"
Bunnie teased.
     "That is not a thing of which to be funny."
     "Maybe you two had better check it out; see if anyone's
coming."  Antoine and Bunnie reluctantly left the room.
     "Be careful!" Sally whispered after them.
     "What's this thing?" Tails asked as he reached for the ring.
     "Don't touch that, Tails!" Sally cautioned.  "We don't know
WHAT it is yet."
     "Awwww."
     "Come on, honey, let's see where Antoine and Bunnie went
to," Sally said as she guided Tails out of the room.
     Sonic opened the envelope and looked at the letter inside by the
light of the power stone.  "Hey, Rotor, this is from Uncle Chuck!"
     "Uh, right.  Maybe I'd better see what the others are
doing," Rotor said as he walked out of the room, figuring that
Sonic would want to read the letter in private.  Sonic began to
read:

     "SONIE,
          IF YOU ARE READING THIS, YOU'VE DISCOVERED SOMETHING I
     WAS WORKING ON FOR YOU BUT WASN'T GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT
     UNTIL YOU HAD COME OF AGE.  I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE CROSS AT
     YOU FOR FINDING THIS, BUT I KNOW HOW UNSTOPPABLE YOU CAN BE.
          THIS DEVICE HARNESSES ENERGY FROM A POWER STONE AND
     CONVERTS IT INTO A PORTABLE FORM; I CALL IT A 'POWER RING.' 
     THESE RINGS ARE USELESS TO ANYBODY BUT YOU; THE OUTER CASING
     CAN RECOGNIZE YOUR GENETIC CODE JUST BY COMING IN CONTACT
     WITH YOUR SKIN.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT EFFECT THE RINGS WILL
     HAVE ON YOU; I HOPE IT WILL BE SOMETHING BENEFICIAL.
          AS PUNISHMENT FOR FINDING THIS MACHINE AHEAD OF TIME,
     YOU OWE ME 100 CHILI DOGS -- YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE 'EM.
                                        LOVE,
                                        UNCLE CHUCK."

     "Yeah," Sonic thought as he wiped away the tears that had
built up, "with extra onions."
     Sonic looked at the ring at his feet.  It gave off a strange
glow but didn't look all that remarkable.  He bent down to pick
it up.
     As soon as he did, he felt something -- almost like a wave
of some sort -- shoot through him.  It was as if something inside
the power ring had found its way into every cell of his body at
once.  It was a sensation he'd never felt before, and it was
wonderful.
     "Cool!"  He had to show this to the others.  Holding onto
the ring, he walked through to where the others had gone.  He
then noticed that the front door was open.  Through the door, he
could see Sally and Tails with their backs to him.  They appeared
to be standing on the sidewalk in front of the house.  He stepped
through the door into the night.
     "Hey, guys!  Check this...."
     He stopped.  He could now see that the others stood huddled
in a small group on the sidewalk, surrounded by four SWATbots
with blasters at the ready.  Sonic could sense another SWATbot
just behind him.

Okay, this is my first effort at writing a StH story.  I promise, it's not
THAT bad.  It's basically my origin, and it's even got Bunnie in it.  So,
even if you don't like the story, it has *one* redeeming factor.  ;)

Oh, and it's kinda big.  This system doesn't like splitting up files, so
it's gonna fly at you as a half-meg chunk.  (If this blows up anyone's mail
queue, I apologize.)

Here it comes...

Timeline: After "Bloodlines", but before "Doomsday".  *shrug*

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

The starship hummed as it approached the solar system.  The apparently
doorless, windowless, disc-shaped reddish interplanetary vehicle dropped out
of warpspace, and dropped to conventional ion drive.  Readjusting its
bearings slightly, and cloaking itself in order to avoid detection, it 
headed toward a medium-sized planet, roughly 92 million miles from its 
sun.  It was an quite inviting, beautiful looking place, that had the    
possibility of supporting millions upon millions of different lifeforms.
Usually, these planets developed intelligent life within 4 billion years or
so after their initial creation.  This planet was one of them.

The inhabitants of this planet called it "Mobius".

The ship first detected the signs of an post-industrial planet three
years ago, as it was doing a routine scan through various frequencies.  The
signals were several years old, but they indicated this "Mobius" was a
relatively peaceful planet, with only a single squabble between city states
bothering the otherwise serene world.  But, according to a signal the
ship had picked up a bit later, a man called "Julian" had apparently beaten
them.  The last signal the ship recieved was that a sort of gala
celebration was going to occur to honor this man with a more peaceful
position in the government.  But just as the party was scheduled to begin,
a meteorite finally achieved the 1.679 x 10^80 against to one  
probablility of something penetrating the shields and damaging the 
communications array, and the ship was unable to recieve any further
information about the planet.

Noting the occurance in the ship's log, the computer set a course for the
origin of the signals with the maximum allowed speed for the ship; exactly
99.9% of the speed of light.  (The ship's computer was programmed with a 
directive that forbade it from going faster than light while on 
autopilot, because of the various unpredictable things that could occur 
in jumpspace.) A few years had passed since the beginning of the journey
and its current status, but the ship assumed (with less than a 2% margin of
error, according to its calculations of probablility according to the
information it had recieved) that the planet had not changed dramatically
within the past several years.

And now, the ship was slowing to a slow orbit around the planet, and was
doing a sensor sweep in order to determine the planet's exact status.
Needless to say, the ship was mostly correct.  The planet still appeared to
be a relative paradise.  However, one dramatic change had occured.  The
coordinates of the capital city, which was described as an "garden city",
was now covered in a black-grey smog cloud.  Had some sort of volcanic
eruption occured?  The ship reconfigured its sensors scanned for
carbon-based lifeforms.  Two showed up, both of them apparently bipedal, 
evolved simians.  Obviously, the ship hypothesised, some sort of major 
catastrophe had severely damaged the city, and had only left two survivors.
However, the ship also detected motion below.  Switching to IR, it peered
through the murky clouds, and spotted several thousand bipedal machines,
vaguely resembling various evolved mammals, doing various tasks.  The ship
was puzzled for a moment, and then came to the conclusion that they could
possibly be cyborgs.  Sure enough, when the ship scanned for cybernetic
lifeforms, the beings below showed up on the scans.

Now the ship was in a quandry.  Within a few years, Mobitropolis had
apparently switched from garden city to ultra-industrial megacomplex for no
obvious or logical reason.  The view of the environment must have radically
changed for the leaders of the planet, the ship surmised, or else they
would not be damaging it so.  Whoever decided on this decision must have
felt they were under some sort of threat, because the ship then detected
beam weaponry on the planet's surface.  But from what?  Nothing threatened
them from space, for they were the only inhabited world around for several
light years.  The rest of the planet appeared relatively uninhabited, and
there were surely no armies on the planet capable of damaging that city.

As if to disprove the ship's assumption in an ironic sense, a large
explosion was suddenly detected within the limits of the city.

The explosion was apparently caused by a sort of sabotage, for a platoon of
heavily armed robots was racing toward it, firing at an unknown 
terrorist that the ship could not detect (due to the severe interference).
Moments later, the firing ceased.  Either the shots had reached their
target, or the terrorist had escaped.  The ship was about to note the
first in its log when a very fast-moving bluish object was detected racing
toward the area called "The Great Forest".  Before a scan could be
activated, it was gone.  

The ship had come to the conclusion that this planet was not a good place
to land.  Apparently, some sort of major upheaval had occured, and the area
did not look very inviting.  It decided to leave before something else
happened.  

However, the ship then realized it would have to power down its cloak in
order to pull out of orbit, and expose itself to whichever inhabitants were
running things down on Mobius' surface.  Also, if it left orbit, it would
be unable to find another suitable planet to land on, due to the damage
done to the communications array.  It now had no choice but to land.
Protocol demanded it land away from a settled area.  Fortunately, those
were widespread...  It also wanted to land someplace where it could decloak
and remain covered.  Scanning the surface, it discovered a small 
clearing deep within the Great Forest that could it could safely land in, 
which had no large or intelligent life forms around it.  Not only that, a 
small creek was spotted no more than 10 yards away from the center of the 
site.  It would be an ideal place to land in.  

It decended into the atmosphere without disrupting it enough for anyone to
really notice.  It soared above the Great Forest, found the spot it had
selected from orbit, and descended into it.  Moments later, the ship had
landed uneventfully and silently within the small clearing.  

After the landing had completed, the ship set up a camoflaged canopy so to
keep the ship from being spotted from orbit.  After all, it couldn't remain
cloaked indefinitely, and when the ship's passenger finally emerged, he
would wish to work in secret.  In seconds, the clearing no longer appeared
to exist from any altitude higher than 10 feet above it.  

Things were moving along rather smoothly.  All that was left to be done was
to reactivate the pilot, and the repairs on the ship could begin.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Immediately behind the cockpit, an area had been set up for the cryogenic
storage of a single individual.  As the ship began to power back up the
area, it slowly became visible to an observer's sight.  It was basically a
single man-sized tube, connected to a coolant pipe and a computer.  The
computer began to hum as the pipe began to withdraw from the tube.  Then, 
from the back of the room, a small laser powered up and began to fire at
the tube.  It slowly began to grow red from the laser's heat.  After a
predetermined period of time, it ceased.  The ship then removed whatever
liquid remained in the tube, and pumped it outside.  Finally, it
appeared the process had been completed. The tube opened up so to
allow its contents to exit, and the machinery shut down.

Jhoeseophae awoke groggily from his long slumber.  <<"Arrgh.">> he muttered
as he wandered over and put on his clothes.  He stumbled over to the
replicator, generated something hot and wet, and threw it down his throat.
Now with most of his faculties active, he wandered over to the mirror.
As a test of his cognative abilities, he decided to examine himself as an
impartial observer, and see what he could infer about himself from
a quick examination.

The green eyes bored into his face.  He was a vulpine, bipedal and highly
evolved.  Orange fur.  Eyes that seemed to radiate intelligence.  
Razor-sharp teeth.  Slight muscular build, but somewhat apathied from the
long period in stasis.  Roughly 23 years old.  On the tall and slim side 
for his species, standing at about 6'4" and roughly 180 pounds.  

Seeing that his mental faculties were operating at optimum efficiency, he
went over to his wardrobe and threw on some clothes.  A pair of
fashionably-frayed denim pants, with a pair of knee-high black metal-tipped
boots were laying about, so he put those on.  Platinum-buckled belt, and a 
green t-shirt...didn't look THAT dirty...  Fingerless gloves were already 
on, so had to complement the ensemble with his grey trenchcoat.  Voila.  
Instant cool.

Now that he felt pretty good about himself, he wandered into the cockpit to
discuss his awakening with the ship's AI, Bahb.  <<"Okay,">> said 
Jhoeseophae aloud, sitting down in the captain's chair, <<"where are we, 
Bahb?">>

<<"We are on a planet called Mobius.">> spake the computer in a sexless,
mechanical voice.

<<"Tell me what you know about Mobius, Bahb.">> said Jhoeseophae.
						     
And Bahb did.

<<"This is not good, Bahb, you know that?">>

<<"Affirmative.  Landing on this planet at this stage of its development is
not advised.">>

<<"Then why are we here?">>

<<"Repairs required for communications array.  Cannot continue with mission
until repaired.">>

<<"So we're stuck here, on a planet in the midst of an all-out war, with a
busted radio and no place to go until I fix it?">>

<<"Affirmative.">>

<<"How do I fix it, Bahb?">>

<<"Unknown.  Pilot intervention required.">>

Jhoeseophae mused over this point, grabbed some tools laying next to the
seat, and walked over to the hatch.

<<"Open the hatch, Bahb.">> he said, and it was.

Jhoeseophae emerged out into the canopy's filtered moonlight.  The area
appeared fairly healthy.  The plants were green, and the water looked crisp
and clear.  It didn't look like a industrial hell, and certainly didn't
have the aura of death about it.  After a few deep breaths, he padded 
quietly over to the area of the smooth, oval-shaped ship's 
communications array.

<<"Arrgh.">>

The communications array looked totaled.  Something a tad larger than a
full-grown vulpine's head had hit the thing, and hit it hard.  Most of the
parts were pulverized.  He sighed.  Jhoeseophae was incapable of 
repairing it, even with his arsenal of technological knowledge.  
He walked back into the ship, and sat back down in the captain's chair.

<<"Bahb?">>

<<"Aye.">>

<<"We got any extra communications arrays back there?">>

<<"Negative.  However, one could be replicated.">>

<<"Do you have enough power to do that?">>

<<"Negative.">>

Somehow, he had expected that would be the answer.

<<"Are there any power sources on the planet you could utilize?">>

<<"Scanning.  Please wait.">>

He waited for about 3 minutes, and then heard:

<<"Potential energy source located.">>, Bahb beeped, <<"Designation: 
Crystalline.">>  Jhosesophae's hope began to rise until he heard, 
<<"Location:">> Bahb suddenly fell silent. <<"Electromagnetic flux from
Mobitropolis makes exact location currently unavailable.">>

He sighed.  <<"Any good raves on Mobius, Bahb?">>

Robotropolis, shortly after the "terrorist attack":

Snively hated his life some days, with a bottomless, infinite passion.  
This was one of those days.  Yet again the Freedom Fighters (curse them!)
had detonated another vital part of Robotropolis, and yet again Snively had
to be the bearer of bad news.  He didn't know why, just once, a SWAT Bot
couldn't tell Robotnik the bad news.  At least they were expendable.  Of
course, in Robotnik's red, glowing eyes, so was he...

He wandered into the Death Egg's control room, where Robotnik spent the
majority of his day.  He was sitting there in his chair, tapping his left
index finger on the left armrest.  Just sitting there, waiting.  

Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.

Robotnik spoke first.  "Let me guess, Snively," Robotnik sneered, not
turning around, "you have bad news for me, don't you?"

Snively started stuttering.  "Umm...y-y-yes, Dr. Robotnik.  Umm...the #6
Refinery, uh, uhmm..."

Robotnik spun the chair around, and glared at Snively with all his might.
"#6 was DESTROYED, wasn't IT?!"

"Uhh..."

"Shut up!" Robotnik roared with all his might, "I *know* about the #6
Refinery, you simpering dullard!"  Robotnik lept out of his chair, grabbed 
Snively by the scruff of the neck before he had a chance to get away, and 
shoved him against the screen showing the flaming wreckage of the said 
refinery being cleaned up by various robotizised citizens.  "I *watched* 
the attack from HERE!"  Snively could only freeze in a sort of delayed 
survival instinct.  "Didn't I tell you last week to TRIPLE the amount of
SWAT Bots guarding the refinery zones?  DIDN'T I?!?  After all, they
attacked #1 a month and a half ago, #2 5 weeks ago, #3 the next week, etc!
We've only got the #7 *left* now, Snively!  WE are going to be SHUT DOWN 
unless we can keep #7 up!  Do you know what that MEANS?!?" 

Snively desperately tried to defend himself as Dr. Robotnik twisted his arm
around so that Snively and him were now eye-to-eye.  In a burst of
confusion mized with fear, Snively uttered, "I d-d-did t-triple the 
amount, sir..."

Dr. Robotnik roared in rage, and threw Snively at the nearest wall, which
he collided into painfully.  Robotnik then strode over to the intercom, and
pushed the button down with a sudden calm.  "Quintruple the amount of SWAT
Bots guarding #7 Refinery."  "Yes, sir." a voice on the other side spoke.

Repressing the remainder of his anger, he sat back down in his chair, and
stared into the viewscreens.  He was now seriously depressed.  Repairs were
continuing on the first few refineries, but the first one that was
destroyed would not be operational for another 2 days from then.  If that
blasted hedgehog attacked #7 tomorrow (which he probably would, considering
that if he did, it would annoy Robotnik further), and destroyed it,
Robotropolis would probably have to slow down for a few days until the new
refinery went up, which they would, of course, attack.  

He was at a critical point now.  If they were able to continue destroying
his refineries, he'd have to either shut down or find an alternative, more
efficient, and probably (yuck) cleaner energy source for Robotropolis.  The
whole scenerio depressed him.  Even beating the crap out of Snively (who was
up against the wall, wheezing) didn't make him feel better.  He growled,
pounded his fist against the armrest, and swore for a little bit about the
hedgehog's demise until he felt somewhat more civil.  Suddenly, he thought 
of a way to make himself feel better, yet do something constructive at 
the same time.  

He pushed the intercom button again.  "Bring up a prisoner, please.", he
said evilly.  He always put on an air of faux politeness when about to
torture the living daylights out of another sentinent being.  "Sorry," the 
voice said, "we don't have any prisoners left, sir.  You robotisized them 
all yesterday."  Robotnik blinked.  "What?!?"  The voice sounded less 
sure of itself.  "Yes, sir, don't you remember?  21:00 Robotropolis 
Central Time."  He snarled.  "Then go out and capture some then, and tell 
me when you get them here!"  Sharply, the voice said, "Yes, sir!" and
disappeared into silence.  

Robotnik then looked over to the fairly-recovered Snively.  "Snively," he
said casually, "make yourself useful and go with some SWAT Bots on their
little hunt." Snively just nodded, and ran out of the room.  After he was a
fair distance away, Robotnik muttered, "Good help is so hard to find these
days." and began a perimeter sweep of Robotropolis.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Knothole, after the attack:

The usual small celebration was going on over the destruction of yet
another Robotnik installation.  Sonic, was, of course, drinking in all of
the positive attention and recieving most of the compliments; while Sally
and Rotor, who accompanied Sonic on that mission, would occasionally roll 
their eyes at some of the hedgehog's more gratuitous exaggerations.  After 
a few more minutes, the celebration came to an end, and the trio wandered 
back into Sally's hut to discuss the next mission.

"Well," said she, "we're in good shape, guys.  Robotnik only has one more 
refinery left, so Robotropolis is almost completely come to a halt now."  

"Yeah!" spoke the blue wonder, "So, what time tomorrow do we go to destroy 
lucky #7?  I'll set my alarm."  

"Sonic," Sally said, "if we went off and tried to destroy that refinery, 
we might as well just walk up to Robotnik and surrender.  We barely got 
out of this one alive."  

Sonic started tapping his foot on the ground, and crossed his arms.  "Well, if
that's the way you feel about it, Sal, I'll do it myself!  I know how Rotor
plants the bombs!  *I* can do it!"

Sally looked over at Rotor.  "Well," the walrus said, "they aren't really
*that* complex.  All he'd have to to is type in however much time he'd need
on the first one, and all the others would sync."

Noting that point, Sally mentally selected another one and glared at Sonic.
"Are you insane?!  Robotnik will at least have 400 SWAT Bots in there, and 
you KNOW they'll be on alert now."

Sonic smirked, and gesticulated his arms in a manner an umpire denotes a 
player is "safe".  "A few hundred 'bots won't slow me down.  It'll be a
breeze."  

"A *breeze*?!" Sally shouted, "You'll be slaughtered!"

"Ha!" the blue one noted, "I'll be there and back before they'll even
notice the attack!" and snapped his fingers.

"Sonic..." she pleaded, "I forbid you to do this.  It's just too
dangerous."

"I *live* on danger!" cried the hedgehog, "and if I pull this one off,
Robotnik will REALLY be hurtin'!  C'mon, Sal, let me do it!"

Sally looked over at Sonic.  "Look, I'll tell you in the morning.  I need
to consider this, okay?"

Sonic smiled.  "Sure, Sal, no sweat.  You know where to find me."  With
that, he powered himself up and rocketed out the door.  Lightly grabbing 
any stable objects, Sally and Rotor rode out the shockwave with a minimum 
of distress.

"You're going to let him go, aren't you?" said Rotor softly.

She sighed.  "Do I really have a choice?  Even if I say no, he'll go."
She took a breath.  "At least if I tell him when to go, I'll be able to see
him leave..."

"Now Sally," Rotor spake, "don't act like that.  Sonic will come back from
this one.  I just know it."

Sally walked over to the window, and stared up into the night sky.  
"I just hope you're right, Rotor."

Suddenly, Tails walked in.  "Aunt Sally," he said, "we're out of berries
again.  Should I go out and pick some tomorrow?"

Sally sighed.  "Uh, sure, Tails.  Could you take Bunnie with you?  She's
been pacing around here bored."

Tails smiled.  "Sure, Aunt Sally, it'll be my pleasure!"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

A new day broke over the Great Forest.  Light streamed in through the
leaves of the various trees, and most of the animals, sentinent and
non-sentinent alike, were awakened.  

Jhosesophae came out of sleep mode, and forced himself to stand.  A 
rapid exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen occured, and his appendeges were 
properly recalibrated.  (To a layman, that would be percieved as Jhosesophae
yawning and stretching out.) 

He wandered over to the replicator, created a yellow cube about 5 cubic 
inches in volume, and began eating it.  He wandered into the cockpit, sat
down in the chair, and activated the screen.  <<"Status report.">>

Bahb beeped back to life as Jhosesophae reclined and ate his cube.  
<<"In a two klick radius around the ship, approximately 1.5 small mammals 
had been detected moving in the last 12 hours.  None have come within one 
klick of the ship.  4 birds had been detected flying above the ship at a 
average altitude of 100 yards above sea level.  150 worms have been noted 
approxamately 2 inches below the landing gear.  The temperature outside is 
+73.5 degrees.  The probability it will remain clear today is 95.1%.  Fuel
level is at 75% of maximum.  Communications array is down.  Weapons, cloak,
shields, navigation, transporters, propulsion, sensors, life support and 
cryogenic storage are on standby.">>

Jhosesophae finished his cube.  <<"We need to get those crystals, Bahb.  Do
you detect any mines or above-ground sources of them today?">>

<<"Electromagnetic flux is currently low enough for a precise scan.">> Bahb
tweeted proudly, <<"Now scanning for crystals.">>

<<"Confirmed.">> Bahb beeped.  <<"An enterance to a mine system exists
exactly 3 miles from here, in the center of a whirlpool.">>

<<"I hate water,">> Jhosesophae uttered, <<"But I hate being marooned even
more.">> Jhosesophae grabbed his microcomputer from a shelf, walked to the
replicator, and placed it on the replicator's altar.  <<"Bahb, waterproof
and charge this device.">> Bahb quietly did so, with a pulse of plasmatic
energy.  He then removed the computer from the pad.  <<"Bahb, link with
this device.">> Suddenly, Bahb's voice was heard from the small speaker on
the device.  <<"Affirmative.">> 

Jhosesophae took a small stun weapon from another counter as he walked into
the transporter tube.  <<"Bahb, teleport me as close as you possibly can to
the enterence to the mine, but keep me distant from other life forms.">>
Bahb didn't answer.  It merely set coordinates and shot Jhosesophae through
the atmosphere.

Seconds later, Jhosesophae rematerialized about 5 feet from the edge of the
whirlpool.  He noted that this was where the creek ended that ran by the
side of his craft.  <<"Bahb, copy.">>, not expecting an answer.

The device beeped somewhat with some light static, <<"On standby.">>

Jhosesophae suddenly realized that this was technically impossible.  
<<"Bahb, how are you doing this?">> 

The device uttered, <<"Your microcomputer has a seperate communications
array than the central one on the ship.  A small version of the main array,
with a lesser range, is implanted inside the ship.  That is how my signals
are reaching you.">>

<<"Oh,">> Jhosesophae said, <<"that makes sense.  How much further away can
you reach me from?">>

<<"You can go either 100 more miles in any direction horizontally or
straight up, or 5 feet straight down.  The soil on this planet is
interfering with the array.">>

Jhosesophae grumbled.  <<"Very well.  I'm going down the whirlpool now, and
I'm leaving my communicator up here.  I will try to report back on an
regular basis.  Over and out.">>

<<"Affirmative.  Good luck.">>

As Bahb fell silent, Jhosesophae looked down into the watery pit.  Thinking
about the approximate size of the crystal he was going to need, and the
fact that it was probably going to weigh an excessive amount, he calmly
removed his trenchcoat, boots and jeans, and folded them neatly beneath the
microcomputer.  Then, grabbing the stun pistol in his jaws, he plunged 
beneath the surface.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

He swam as hard as he could down through the narrow passageway.  Lower and
lower he went into the hole, descending deep into the heart of the
underground caverns.  Suddenly, he felt a current pulling behind him. 
Instinctively following it, he swam for another few yards until he slowly
began to see a dim light further ahead.  Pouring on the speed, he
determinedly swam toward the light, and finally emerged inside an
airpocket.  As he took some much-needed oxygen into his system, he glanced 
around at his surroundings.  

Meanwhile, a creature was watching the vulpine's movement within the
tunnel, and silently waited for him to exit it again.

He was floating by the shore of an currently unused crystal vein.  They
lined the walls, and glowed with a mysterious, yet beautiful, light.  As he
pulled himself onto a slab of granite, he marvelled at the strange calm
that this room seemed to have about it.  He stood there for a minute or two
on the inlet, and then resigned himself to his work.  He found a crystal
that appeared to be of a medium-size, and used his stun-ray to cut it off
the side of the cavern.  After it had been freed from the wall, he tucked
it under his shoulder, put the stun-ray back in his mouth, and dove back
into the water.

This had been much easier than expected, he thought to himself, and he
could probably get off this planet before anyone ever knew he was there.

The creature saw the fox leave the cavern, and silently prepared itself for
a filling meal.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

As Jhosesophae swam back through the tunnel, and out toward the shaft
leading back up to the surface, a shape shot past him, startling him.
He dropped the crystal out of an instinctual reaction to the threat, and
tried to swim as fast as he could up the shaft.  But whatever darted past
him saw this intent, and wrapped a sort of tenticle around his leg,
restraining his escape.  He turned to face whatever was grabbing him, and
suddenly realized he was in a deep spot of trouble.

It seemed to be some sort of robotic octupus.  But this particular model
was also outfitted with a a beak made out of two chainsaws, lazer beams by
its eyes, and incredibly strong tendrils with little spikes on them.  Very
*sharp* spikes, because they hurt a lot and were making him bleed.  

Pain made him mad.

With a sort of psychotic glee, he took the stun pistol from his mouth, and 
set the device to maximum power.  Looking over at the creature, he smiled
and shot it a "big mistake there, pal" look, and blasted the evil thing right 
inbetwixt the eyes.  It released his leg, and seemed to stumble backwards,
if such a thing is possible underwater.  But the thing was not yet dead. 
It fired several shots of a sort of death-ray beam at Jhosesophae, and
emitted a "HALT FREEDOM FIGHTER!" at him.  However, since Jhosesophae was
not familiar with the Mobian language, he had no idea that this thing was
actually one of Dr. Robotnik's defense mechanisms that was posted on the
outskirts of the mine's underground river.  He dodged the beams and blasted
the thing in the head again with his particular beam weapon.  It reeled
again from the impacts, but had one last trick up its robotic sleeves.  It
whipped one of its tendrils around like a mace and shot several of the
spikes off its tendrils at Jhosesophae.  He was able to dodge the majority
of them, but a few of them caught him in the back, giving the holes in his
leg some company.

At this point, Jhosesophae was so incredibly mad at this creature, he had
completely forgotten about the crystal and was now dedicated to totally
decimating this creature once and for all.  He rushed at the octupus and
knocked it against the wall.  While it was stunned, Jhosesophae ran at it,
and tore at the holes that he had put in the octupus, looking for anything
that looked vital and smashing it to bits.  It tried to thrash around, but
Jhosesophae would not let it get away.  Finally, he spotted the CPU of the
evil machine and punched it with all his might.

With a single whistle, the machine sunk to the bottom of the cavern, never
to move again.  

Having stopped the threat, Jhosesophae dove down to the bottom of the 
cavern.  He collected his crystal, and swam back up to the surface to catch
his breath.  He hoped this sort of thing wasn't going to happen to him
often while he was here.  This planet was becoming less hospitable every
day.  

He returned back to the bright sunlight of the surface.  Placing the
crystal next to the communicator, he spoke, <<"Bahb, copy.">>

<<"Welcome back, Jhosesophae.">> the device said, <<"Were you sucessful in
your endevor?">>

<<"Affirmative.  Will this crystal suffice?">>

Bahb scanned the crystal.  <<"Negative.  One more is required of this size
in order to properly replicate the communications array.">>

Jhosesophae sighed.  <<"Confirmed.  Be back in a minute.">> He dreaded
returning to the area, in case there were more of the things that attacked
him down there, but he wanted off this crazy rock extremely badly.  He dove
back down beneath the water with his stun ray in tow, and hoped he'd never 
have to do this again.

A few hundred yards away, on a trail leading close by to the pool in
question, Bunnie was escorting Tails back to Knothole.  She'd never say
that in front of Tails, of course, because Tails felt that he was competent
enough to pick some raspberries, which he had done sucessfully, and take
them back to Knothole himself.  The reason Bunnie was coming along, Tails
believed, was because she was going slightly stir-crazy from hanging around
Knothole for so long without going on a mission.  Besides, Sonic was busy
planning his strategy for tonight's mission, and was unavailable.    

"Thanks for lettin' me come along wit'cha, Tails," Bunnie said,
perpetuating the ruse, "I was gettin' kinda bored helpin' out Rotor all
day." Like Sonic gets tired of eatin' chili dogs, she thought, smiling
internally...

"It's okay, Aunt Bunnie." Tails said politely, snapping her out of her
daydream.  Suddenly, Tails saw something glitter through the trees over 
by the pond.  He placed his arm out in front of Bunnie, and gestured toward
the pond.  In a unspoken understanding, they slipped quietly off the trail
and walked in a semicircle behind the source of the shine.  They slipped
almost immediately behind it when they saw its source; a large chunk of
crystal. 

This puzzled the both of them.  That size crystal just doesn't grow on the
land.  Only ones that are found underground grow that large.  "We should
get a closer look," Tails whispered, "in case it *did* just happen to end
up there."  

Bunnie was slightly more conservative.  "Ya wanna get yer head shot off, 
sugar?  This looks like a trap!  We should go back to Knothole and tell 
Sal 'bout this."

"And how," Tails muttered, "do you expect to get back to Knothole?  The
path is the only way I know of from here."

Bunnie was stumped for an answer.  She didn't know another way, either.
"Okay, sugar," she said to Tails, "but you go back to Knothole and tell
everyone, okay?"  Tails nodded, gained some altitude, and flew off toward
Knothole.  After he was out of sight, she cautiously crept closer
to the pond.  As she got closer, she noticed a pair of black boots next to 
a pile of clothing, with a microcomputer like Sally had next to it.  "Y'all
went for a swim?" she thought as she crept closer, gazing upon the crystal.
"Then what d'y'all need such a big crystal for?  They don' float..."

Suddenly, the computer tweeted threateningly at her.  "Halt, Mobian 
intruder!" it shouted in perfect Mobian.  Bunnie looked dumbfounded at the
machine.  "Huh?" she said, confused.  

"Halt!  Halt!"

Realizing she was still walking, she ceased.  "What's your problem, little
computer?"  

"You are permitted to go no closer.  Go back!"  As to accent this point,
the computer somehow fired some energy beams in the air until she started
to back up.

Slowly, she backed up, back into the forest, until she noticed blood in the
water, and started putting two and two together.  Clothing by a pool.  
Blood in the water.  A belligerent, armed computer.  And then, two or three
bubbles popped on the surface of the water, as to be sure she understood
what was going on here.  She came to the conclusion that the device was
somehow picking people off who walked by the path (which was no more than
2-3feet from the edge of the water).  She couldn't just leave the thing
there in good conscience undistrubed.  So, as she passed by a nearby
boulder, she kicked it at the microcomputer.  It fired at the rock, but it
ricocheted off the rock and hit Bunnie's abdomen instead, knocking her 
unconscious.  As Bunnie hit the ground, the rock hit the microcomputer.  If
the ground would have been hard, it would have broken it.  However, the
soft mud gave way beneath it, and it sunk underneath it harmlessly.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

This probably could have been avoided if Jhosesophae had gotten the last
crystal at a slightly more rapid pace.  Unfortunately, accidents happen,
and Jhosesophae surfaced just seconds after the incident occured.
            
<<"Bahb,">> Jhosesophae said, wiping water from his eyes, <<"I've got the
last crystal.  Do you co--">> Suddenly, he noticed what had just happened.
<<"Oh no.">> He turned over the rock, grabbed the communicator, and wiped
it off.  <<"Bahb, WHAT DID YOU DO?!">>  Before Bahb could answer,
Jhosesophae intervened.  <<"NEVER MIND!  Just beam everything directly to
sick bay, STAT!">>  Seconds later, all evidence that Jhosesophae ever came 
to that pond was gone, aside for some torn-up grass, was gone.

Back on the ship, Jhosesophae was frantically applying some first aid to
the damaged cybunny.  <<"Bahb, you better hope REAL HARD that was just a
stun ray.">> he cursed, as he got finished patching Bunnie up.  He then
rushed back to the replicator.  <<"Okay, now what?">>

<<"Place the crystals in the engine core, and I'll take care of the
rest.">> Bahb noted.  Jhosesophae complied, sticking the two large crystals
next to the smaller crystal rods already present.  

Bahb immediately set to its work.  It first cut out (using microblasts from
the weapons systems) the damaged communications array, so that there was a
somewhat jagged hole in the side of the ship.  Then, it created a energy 
pattern similar to a perfectly functioning communications array and placed 
it inside the transporter's energy buffer.  Finally, it teleported it over 
the hole in the hull that used to be the communications array.  After 
reinitializing the communications systems, and by bending several laws of
physics, the ship was yet again at 100%.

<<"Repairs complete,">> spake Bahb, <<"All systems at 100% efficiency.">>

<<"Good,">> said Jhosesophae.  <<"Now, I'm going to put on some clothing.  
Please keep our guest in REM sleep for the duration of my absence.">>
The ship beeped in compliance as Jhosesophae began putting on a similar
outfit; and wondered how exactly to deal with this new snag in his plan.
Suddenly, he discovered another snag.  He was still bleeding profusely from
his legs and back.  While this didn't bother him as such, it was getting
all over the carpet.  So, he wandered back into sick bay, laid down on an
unoccupied slab, and activated the medical robot.  After he was bandaged
up, and the cuts and nicks welded shut, he dressed himself and checked on
the damaged cybunny's condition.  

The sucking hole in her abdomen was healing nicely.  In about 5 minutes,
she'd be healed enough to release.  Then, he could get off this insane
rock, and back into space, where it was SAFE.  He was definitely not
recommending this place to anyone.  Suddenly, he sensed that she was
starting to awaken.  He activated the restraining field, and backed up a
few paces.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Bunnie slowly started to come out of her forced slumber.  Her head felt
like someone had used it to bowl a perfect game.  "Ooh, muh head..." she
groaned as she tried to sit up.  Suddenly, she felt the wound in her
stomach, winced, and laid back down again.  Sitting up was not something
she was going to do for a while.  

"Please don't do that." a synthesised voice uttered.

"Huh?" Bunnie groaned, as she opened her eyes.

The room was white.  White, and lit by some unknown source.  She was laying
on one of the many slabs that were around the room.  A single doorway lead
out directly in front of her.  A monitoring unit was to her left,
apparently keeping track of her life signs.  A tall, thin orange fox was
monitoring it.

This obviously wasn't Robotropolis.  If it was, they'd finish her off
around now.  But if it wasn't Robotropolis, and it certainly wasn't
Knothole, where was she?  

"Hey," she muttered and waved her roboticized arm at the figure, "you
there!"  The figure either didn't hear her, or didn't understand her.
Jhosesophae heard the creature `making noise' at him, and said <<"Bahb, 
does the creature appear to be sentinent?">>  Bunnie could only look
puzzled.  <<"It appears so,">> Bahb said, <<"Also, she was implanted with
cybernetic limbs that seem to be poisoning her.">>  Jhosesophae hmmed.
<<"Well, we'll ask her about that, later.  For now, I need to know what
she's saying.  Please create a translation program, and prepare to upload
it to my crainal jack via the dataspike.">>  Bahb beeped in compliance, and
a wall in the back of the room suddenly grew a 4-inch long silver spike.
Bunnie watched as the figure walked over to the wall, turned around to have
his back to it, and shoved his skull up to its hilt.  A slight hum filled
the room as an electrical pulse entered the figure's skull.  A minute or
two later, he removed his skull from the spike (which retreated back into
the wall) with no ill effects.

"Well," Jhosesophae said in proper Mobian, "am I coherent to you now?" 
Bunnie weakly nodded.  "Good.  It's always kind of annoying when one lands
on a planet and doesn't know the language."  He smiled, and walked closer
to the discombobulated semi-metallic rabbit.  "You took quite a shot there,
young female.  If you would have been any closer to my device when it went
off," His smile fluxuated slightly.  "Well, let's just say having children
wouldn't be an option."  He perked up again.  "Luckily for you, the blast
only shredded some of your abdomenic muscles, and didn't cut any deeper. 
The healing pad," He gestured at the white gauze-like pad taped to her
stomach. "you have on should return you to normal in about 2 or 3 minutes."
Jhosesophae took a deep breath.  "Okay, do you have any questions?"

"Who are you?  *WHAT* are you?  Why are you here?" 

"Ah," Jhosesophae said, "the inquisitive type.  That sort of attitude gives
me hope for this planet."  He bowed.  "I am Jhosesophae, formerly of the
planet Ur'thae.  Mentally, I am 18 years old.  Physically, I am 315.  You
see, I am a cybernetic device that is used as a manner of
immortality by containing the sum of my meat-brain's neural pathways
encrypted in my circuitry.  And I came here because my ship's
communications array was damaged."

Bunnie blinked.  "Could you explain that in more detail?"

Jhosesophae shrugged.  "As you wish..."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

"About 300 years ago, there was a planet around a star...a very large
distance...away from here.  This planet was mainly populated by what you
call `foxes'.  They had achieved massive technological breakthroughs, such as
a propultion system than enabled them to travel faster than light,
artificial intelligences, and the ability to transfer energy into matter,
and matter into energy."  He let this sink in.  "For a reference point, my 
world was about 100 years ahead of yours in technological prowess before 
whatever happened here happened." 

"However, unlike your world, mine was not a peaceful one.  Wars raged
continuously over the most valuable technology on the planet; the neural
transfer device.  This device, when used in conjunction with a android body
with a neural net, could replicate the thought patterns of any individual
and transfer them into the android's form."

"The main problem with this sort of technology was, of course, the
religious element.  Several of the settlements on the western continent
felt this technology stripped the soul from the essence, thus causing a
scream of psychic agony after transfer was complete.  This was,
hypothetically, causing a major disruption in the psychic plane, and
therefore had to be stopped before the wave started effecting the physical
plane."  

"Of course, very few individuals on the eastern continent, where my father
(the inventor of the process) and I lived, wanted to give up the chance to
further advance science by escaping the limitations of the flesh.  So, a
law was passed; those who wanted to become android versions of themselves
moved to the east, while those who did not moved to the west."

"Well, you'd THINK this would solve the problem, but it didn't.  The
western continent simply became more infuriated at the people in the east,
because they were now isolated from them physically, psychologically, *and*
mentally.  Not only that, but the western continent was far more populous
and prosperous than the east.  The move only allowed the fanatical west to 
stew in their own juices."

"So, the spritual (and not surprisingly, political as well) leaders of 
the east decided their eternity could tolorate no more psychic warping, or
the spirit world was going to burst into this reality, or some horse-hockey
like that, and thus motivated the people to war against the west."

"The wars raged on and off for years.  Major damage was done to both
continents.  Deforestation from napalm runs caused the environment to
slowly collapse, and beam weaponry destroyed most external structures."

"Finally, the world could take no more.  The individuals in the east, being
purely organic, were dying from the inhospitable environment.  The west,
however, was only annoyed by it.  Finally, the east came to a decision.  
Since they could not, and would not, escape the very unfortunate
weaknesses of the flesh by cyborgization, they decided NOBODY would.  They
sabotaged the Central Crystal, which powered the entire planet, and the
planet was suddenly turned into a giant bomb."

"We had 1 hour to live."

"My father..." He bowed his head slightly, took a breath, and continued. 
"My father gave me the greatest gift he possibly could.  He had been
designing a special cyborg body for me, that would be stronger, faster,
heal quicker, and had a better sensory array than any other cyborg on 
Ur'thae.  He was intending to port my intelligence into it on my 21st
birthday.  However, due to the impending disaster, he grabbed me, knocked
me unconscious, and started the process."

"I awoke 5 minutes before the planet exploded.  I was in this body, and I
was in a sort of a daze.  My father said to me, `Son, I cannot escape, but
you can.  Take this star vessel,' and he gestured to the saucer which you
and I now reside, `take this star vessel, and get far from this world.  Take
the knowledge of this planet with you, and teach the rest of our universe
of our mistakes.'  He embraced me, and whispered he loved me into my ear. 
Then, he forced me onto the ship, for I did not want to leave him to die by
himself, and I shot away from my home, my birthplace...my father..."

"I *wanted* to turn back, but he had programmed the ship not to.  By the
time I was able to regain control, there were two stars in my solar system
instead of one.  They had all been utterly destroyed because of a matter of
philosophy..."

He continued on, fighting back tears.  "We were very close.  He and I
worked together on experiments since I was but a kit.  But he gave me the
great burden of sharing the knowledge, history, and culture of my world with
the universe, and the near-infinite time needed to do so."

"After a period of mourning, I programmed the ship to seek out any signals
from planets with intelligent life, set coordinates for them, and awaken me
when we arrived.  I then entered the ship's single cryogenic chamber, and
the reason my father could not go with me, and slept for over 300 years."

"I awoke on this world just a day ago.  The only reason we stopped here was
because the communications array had failed.  Since we were not only forced
to land here, but this planet had large deposits of crystal, I went out to
mine some out of an underground cavern; and after I slayed a large metallic
octupus which tried to destroy me, I met with positive results."

"Unfortunately, you must have discovered the small pool which I dove into
to acquire said crystal, with my small microcomputer defense mechanism
guarding it.  You must have kicked that boulder at it with
your...augmented...legs, and it fired upon it to defend itself. 
Unfortunately, it richoceted off the rock, and hit you.  I discovered you
lying there and teleported us and the crystals I had mined back to the
ship." 

Jhosesophae calmed down considerably.  "Now, I have repaired my ship, and 
I will leave your planet.  Now, I give you a choice.  Since you are
somewhat similar to myself, I will give you a chance that nobody else on
this world has.  You can travel the universe with me, because I have just
enough power left in the replicator to create another cryonic chamber, or
you can remain here."  

Jhosesophae ceased speaking.  Bunnie blinked again.

"Uhh..."

Jhosesophae held up his hands.  "Please, take your time in deciding.  I'm
in no particular rush.  Besides, you need to stay here just a bit longer,
because your stomach is still damaged.  I'll be back in a few minutes, and
you can tell me your answer then."  He smiled, and walked out of the room.

Bunnie started mulling this over in her mind.  She could finally escape the
clutches of Robotnik.  Maybe this person could de-roboticize her.  And she
could do something no Mobian had done before; visit another planet.

But, she remembered what Robotnik had done to her.  What he did to other 
people.  What he was doing to other people!  Then, she thought of the friends 
she'd leave behind.  Tails, Sonic, Sally and Rotor.  They were probably 
looking for her!  She had completely forgotten about that.  No, she could
NOT leave.  

Jhosesophae walked back in.  He removed the bandage from her stomach. 
"Well, that looks a LOT better now than it did before."  She looked down
and didn't even see a scar.  "The muscle tissue will come back in a few
days." he said, and grinned at her again.  "So, what do you say, uh...."

"Bunnie." she said, "Bunnie Rabbot."

"Ah, Miss Rabbot.  Yes.  So, do you wish to travel the 12 Galaxies with me,
or do you wish to stay here?"   

"I gotta stay 'ere, sugar.  I'm needed."

"Needed?" Jhosesophae said.  "But this planet's been trashed.  Why would
anyone be needed here?"

And Bunnie told him why.  She explained what had happened on Mobius, and
what had happened to her.  She told him about the Freedom Fighters, and 
the fight against Robotnik.

This struck a chord in Jhosesophae.  He lifted up Bunnie's robotic arm. 
"So that...animal...did this to you?"

Bunnie nodded sadly.

"I understand why you cannot leave.  What is happening on this planet
should not be allowed to spread to other worlds."  He helped Bunnie to her
feet.  "Come on, we're going to drop you off in style."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Knothole was abuzz with activity.  The rumor was that Bunnie was somehow
captured by Robotnik via some sort of trap.  They had searched the forest
for her, after Tails had returned to Knothole and told them of the
mysterious crystal in the woods.  A search party was sent out to the site,
but they found nothing but some torn-up grass, and a few drops of oil and
blood floating in the water.  When they went down to the pool to take a
closer look, all they found was a trashed sentrybot that guarded a crystal
mine they had not known about before.  No Bunnie.  

The search parties returned unsucessfully, and everyone was starting to
worry.  "You think that a 'bot patrol got her, Sally?  There's been a lot
more of those lately..." Sonic asked.

Sally shrugged.  "I don't know, Sonic.  We can't find her anywhere."

Sonic paced around impatiently.  "Well, Sal," he said, "I'm not gonna wait
around any longer.  I'm gonna hit the refinery and then check the prison
blocks for her."

Sally said, "Sonic, please..."

Sonic scowled.  "You can't stop me now, Sal.  I've got my power ring, and
I'm gonna come back with Bunnie.  It's juice time!"

With a burst of speed, Sonic was nowhere in sight.  "Good luck," Sally
whispered, her soul filled with dread.

Suddenly, the sky began to darken.  People began rushing out of their huts,
and glancing to the sky.  An round shadow blocked out the sun that seemed to
be larger than the entire village.  Panic spread like wildfire.  Nobody
knew what the shadow was, nor if it was Robotnik.  Then, two sparkling 
outlines appeared in the center of Knothole.  Sally rushed out to meet
them, expecting the worst.

After another few seconds, the outlines solidified into the forms of Bunnie
and Jhosesophae.  "Hey there, Sally-girl!" Bunnie shouted, and rushed over
toward Sally and gave her a big hug.  Jhosesophae just stood there.  Sally
had a puzzled look on her face. "Umm, Bunnie..."  Bunnie kept on talking. 
"Boy, wait 'till I tell ya what hap'ened to ME today!"  "Bunnie..."  "I
tell ya, it'd make a pretty good novel."  "Bunnie!"  Bunnie snapped out of
her excited stupor.  "What, Sally?"  "Who is that?" Sally said, and pointed
at the tall, thin, orange vulpine.

Bunnie walked over to Jhosesophae, took his hand, and led him over to the
Princess.  "This is...uh, how do you pronounce it?"  

"Jhosesophae." he said.  

"This is Joseph," Bunnie said, "and he's come from, uh..."

"Ur'thae."

"Earth."

Sally shook the stranger's hand.  "Hello, Joseph."  Jhosesophae 
shook back.  "Hello, Sally.  Your planet is very...uh...nice."

She smiled, and said "Thank you, Joseph.  I'm afraid that it's not in the
best of conditions now, but it used to be quite beautiful."

He smiled.  "I'm sure it was, once."

Then, Sally remembered Sonic's mission.  "Bunnie, Sonic thinks you've been
captured by Robotnik!  He'll rush right into his clutches!  We've gotta
warn him somehow?"

Bunnie said, "But how, sugar?  Nobody's faster than Sonic!"

"Nobody, perhaps," said Joseph, "but not nothing."  He looked up at his
ship.  He activated his communicator.  <<"Bahb, three to beam up.">>  In a 
flash of a molecular limbo competition, they were gone.  The ship pulled 
away from Knothole, leaving the astonished citizens to gawk at the beauty 
of the vessel.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

"This is incredible!" yelled Sally as the ship rocketed through the upper
atmosphere, its cloak activated.  "Your people had these sort of ships?"  

"Yes," he said, "they did.  But this is just a mere two-seater.  Some of
the larger ships were quite glorious."

They coasted above Robotropolis, completely unnoticed by the sensors of
Robotnik.  "Now, let's see if we can find your friend."  He activated the
sensors, and scanned for organic life.  Sure enough, he detected a signal
by the only refinery left standing.  "Your friend is going to get his butt
shot off," Joseph said, "unless we give him a little bit of help."  

Meanwhile, on the surface, Sonic was running for his life.  He had walked
right into a trap, alright.  There were more SWAT Bots there than he had
ever seen in his life.  He had to use his bombs to blast his way out of the
refinery, but didn't do much damage to it otherwise.  Now, he was dodging
lazer fire from every angle, and was probably going to meet his maker on
this one.  That really irritated him.  He'd never get to see Sally again,
he thought as he jumped behind a small wall.  And they'd gotten Bunnie as
well.  That REALLY steamed him.  Robotnik was not only going to get him,
but Bunnie as well.  He was getting ready to suck lazer when the firing
stopped.  

He heard a figure walking toward him.  He turned around to face whatever
demise awaited him.  As he suspected, it was Robotnik.  

"Well, hedgehog," Robotnik growled, gloating, "looks like you've run out of
luck."  He laughed.  "You've got nowhere to run now, do you?  At last, I've
FINALLY got you right where I want you!"  He waved his arms around to show
Sonic the hopelessness of his situation.  "You move, they fire.  You don't
move, I fire.  You've lost, hedgehog!"  He laughed again, louder, enjoying
his triumph.  "I won't give you the honor of being robotized by your
uncle's device!  I'm just going to kill you right now, and I'm going to
make him carry your blackened, smashed carcass into the center of
Robotropolis, and hang it from the highest tower!"  Laughing again, he 
raised his beam weapon pistol at Sonic's head.  "Good-bye, hedgehog."  

As if the hand of a god had swept Sonic up, he was suddenly surrounded by
an energy field, which deflected Robotnik's shot.  "WHAT??!!  NOOO!!!!!!"
he swore, as Sonic began to dematerialize.  "You'll never destroy mee...."
Sonic said as he disappeared into nothingness.  

And then Robotnik was incapable of coherent speech for several hours
afterward.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The ship slowly made its way back to the Great Forest, as Bunnie filled in
both Sally and Sonic about their new friend's life.  They cheered about
Sonic's safe return, and the mood was rather jovial.

"Even though we didn't get that last refinery destroyed," said Sonic, "it
was still worth the power ring to throw Robotnik into such a huff."  He
giggled a little bit.  "Man, I thought I was a goner.  Bet Butt-nik
thought so, too.  Boy, he's gotta be real mad."

Then, the lights began to dim inside the ship.  "Oh no," said Joseph, "this
does not look good.  Bahb, what's wrong?"  Bahb beeped, "WARNING: Power 
levels at 25% and dropping.  Cloak dropping in 3 minutes.  Propultion 
deactivating in 5 minutes." 

Joseph growled, "Bahb, I thought you said that we'd have enough power to
repair the communications array and get off this planet."

Bahb simply uttered, "You didn't give any higher parameters than that,
Jhosesophae.  I used most of the ship's power in repairing the array."

Joseph pounded the dashboard and swore.

"What does that mean?" Sonic said.

"It means I'm going to be here for a while." said he.  "Good thing my 
landing site is only a minute away."

The ship slowly drifted over the site where he had parked last time, and
suddenly dropped right onto it.  The passengers were jostled, but not
seriously injured.  A collective groan went over the ship as they got out
of their seats and departed the ship.  

Joseph looked at the ship.  "Well, so much for my vacation at Alpha
Centauri."  

It wasn't damaged as much as it was submerged.  The nose end of the ship
had sunk into the ground, leaving the rear sticking up at a 80 degree
angle.  The cloaking drones, however, had made the ship appear from the sky
to jut be an especially tall tree, surrounded by several smaller ones.

"Well," Joseph sighed, "You guys got any vacancies in that Knothole?"

"Why yes, we do." Sally said as they walked off toward Knothole, Sally
explaining several things to Joseph the whole time they walked away.

Joseph,

Thanks for the post.  I'm saving all the Sonic fanfic to read in a
couple weeks -- I'm going in for arthroscopic surgery on my left knee
and need SOMETHING to read while I'm on my back for a couple days.

Now that Sonic has been picked up by USA, maybe we should start
encouraging a dialogue between USA, DiC and Sega concerning a third
Sonic season.  After all, USA has a track record of backing original
animation what with Duckman and (eeesh!) Problem Child.  Of course, the
main hurdle would be getting DiC and Sega together in the same room.
(Relevant aside: I read a post on alt.rec.arts.animation from someone
who actually purchased one of the infamous DiC cels -- a picture of
Sally from the opening sequence...megadrool! -- so I know this isn't an
urban legend).

While I'm not a practicing Sub-Genius myself, I own a copy of Rev.
Stang's _High Weirdness By Mail_.  Though it could use some serious
updating, it is still an indispensible field guide to the terrain of
humanity.  

Later,

Well, at least now we know the truth...I'm just glad that Sega's at least

I feel the same way about _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.  <VBG>
Not that I think anyone cares, but I'm almost done with _Mostly Harmless_.

Good guess.  Yes, in my storylines, the thoughts of one of the Gem Children
(the most powerful at the time, but not the most powerful ever) had his
thoughts incorporated into the android Packbell's brain.  However, all
memory of his former existence was erased.  I'm writing a story that
explains that, retells the story of the taking of Bluebrook, and several
other things.  I don't have a title for it yet, I just know that it's going
to be a prelude to a storyline I'm brainstorming called the Ignition Factor
series (which, incidentally, follows the adventures of the most powerful
Gem Child ever...although there's a more powerful one in some alternate
realities, but we won't get into that).  Sooo, long story short, wait for
the long story so I don't have to continue writing here in the short.

Subject: Comments on Sonic Comic #29 (spoilers)
Sender: owner-sonic@bort.mv.net
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: sonic@bort.mv.net

Here are my comments on Sonic 29, FWIW:

I'll let somebody else summarize all the plot and credit details...

Spoiler alert:

Well, I see they know how to give green eyes to _somebody_ (namely, Dulcy).
Now if only they'd get Bunnie's right...

And isn't it convenient that the portable de-roboticizer would have only
_one_ charge left (and of course I assume they can't figure out how to 
recharge it or anything...)

I'll let somebody else comment on how Antoine was holding Bunnie...

Why should Sally have volunteered to be roboticized when Uncle Chuck's 
already there?  Or was this story set before he had regained his will? 
(Maybe the next issue will clarify this - Uncle Chuck's on the cover...)  
While I appreciate the comic's move towards the Sat. AM Sonic, I wish they'd 
note how it fits into the continuity, sort of like the Gargoyles comic is 
doing (or at least _was_ doing) with respect to the daily show.

I don't know whether to be glad or disappointed at them not showing Sally's
roboticization - by not doing so, they spare us a possibly horrific sequence;
but OTOH this might have given the story even more drama...  And of course
the widget that was supposed to preserve her free will "fell off" during the 
process - again, how convenient.  Why didn't Rotor clip it to her or 
something?  (Or even stick it _in_ her ear?)

Odd that the process preserved all of Sally's coloring...

And while they at least showed _some_ struggle on Sally's part to obey 
Robotnik while roboticized, given her intense feelings for the Freedom 
Fighters (and presumably Sonic), I'd've thought she'd've struggled a bit 
harder and longer (maybe we can blame it on the shock of being 
roboticized)...

But the art by Mawhinney and Koslowski was excellent as usual...

The fan art isn't too shabby this time out (fanboys check out Sally's 
outfit); but I wouldn't think Bunnie and Sally are into tattoos and pierced 
ears, and Bunnie's _left_ arm is the robot one, not her right...

Now onto the Tails story:

That was a rather lame escape by Tails: using fur from his tails to clog up
the roboticizer???  They didn't look too threadbare after he got out, and I
would think anything that could handle a whole two-tailed fox could handle 
whatever loose fur he could shake off...

I also find it hard to believe Tails' tails are strong enough for him to 
pull out a mechanical tree by the roots and swing it like a golf club (but 
it was still amusing :^)).

That bit about "robbing me of my _innocence_" was a bit much - at the risk
of getting a bit crude, just how realistic _was_ that Fiona automaton?  (And 
note that the letter column for this issue has a quasi-explanation for Tails 
being 10 not 5, but 10 is still a bit young for this sort of thing, isn't it?
Or do Mobians hit puberty quicker than we do?)  And again, Tails' comment 
about "my lost youth" was a bit overdramatic; while it may be true, I doubt 
most people recognize the loss of their youth *when it happens* - I'd say it
takes years for it to sink in (and for us toon fans, maybe it never does :^)).

And another cliche: the nearly-instantly-rusting-out-when-wet-robot; I
could've believed a short-circuit, but not rust.  And I don't know whether 
to applaud Fiona's final tear as a nice touch, or sneer at it as yet another 
predictable cliche...

But the art by Manak and Harvo was fairly good; Tails really did look 
half-dead when Fiona was about to dunk him for the third time (although he 
seemed to make a typical toonish quick recovery from it :^)).  I hope they 
do as good a job in the Tails miniseries...

Tidbits from the letters page: I'll let Dan Drazen flame the continuing 
office humor; Dylan is revealed to be a porcupine (then why didn't they name 
him Patrick or Percy or something?); Antoine is said to be 18 (then isn't 
Sally a bit young for him?  But he sure doesn't _act_ 18...); and Boomer was 
a former nickname for Rotor supposedly because of his voice (O-kayyyy...).

I suppose all the above seems a bit harsh; I'll confess I've been in a bit
of a bad mood this weekend due to various things (not having a life being 
part of them), but I still think the observations above are valid.  Also, 
I'd rather have flawed stories like the above that at least try to live up 
to the Sat. AM Sonic, then the lame ones of the earlier days that weren't
much better than the daily shows.

Yeah, it's a puzzlement.  Especially when Bunnie and Uncle Chuck have a 
real need of it. (but then, what would that do to the plot?)

To quote Lurch: You Rang?

Frankly, what drooling fanboy wouldn't want to put their arms around Bunnie?

Since in the SatAm Uncle Chuck had been revealed as a spy, Robotnic would 
probably dismantled him to find out why he broke conditioning.  It isn't 
out of continuity (much) so I'll pass on flaming them here.


I'll save the rest of my comments for later.

You didn't mention which format these files were in.  Are they MOD, 
S3M, MIDI or just simply digitized sounds (WAV, VOC, SND, etc).  If 
you're talking MIDI or MOD, then I'm VERY interested, if you're 
talking WAV or other digitized sound formats, then nahhhhh... since I 
already digitized all these songs anywayz and I have SONIC CD itself 
and I can play the music tracks straight off of that on my computer 
(and dub 'em on the HDD if I feel like it).

I would be VERY interested if anyone would be able to RIP the music 
straight off of these games (including the Genesis/Sega CD 
synthesised music) as opposed to just a simple vanilla hard drive 
wasting digitized grab.  If anyone knows of any such files existing...
 PLEASE.. do tell! :P

TTFN!

BTW: Why do I always get those symbols when Alex writes messages?  
(You know.. the I=B4 instead of a '...is this some kind of strange 
international thing or is this maybe part of his mailer's way of 
converting those signs?  Gets real annoying sometimes, not that Alex 
can help it, perhaps.

KEWL!  Just as good as a MIDI or MOD!  :)  I can always enter in the 
music into a MIDI sequencer and have it play on the computer. :)  Any 
way I can get ahold of 'em?

Greetings, fellow writers, FT players, and Sonic Net members!

I have a few crazy ideas (*smirk*) that I want to throw out to the general
Sonic Net populace for suggestions and approval:

-Character Profiles:  HTML pages featuring the 3rd-party Sonic characters
 (i.e. David, Bookshire, Sandra, Todd, and so on) from the short stories modeled
 after the SatAM show (and if there's a demand for it, I'll consider
characters from
 FT as well).  Here's what I'm looking for as of now:

 Name (of course :) )
 Species
 Gender
 Physical Profile
 Mental Profile
 History (birthdate, death (if applicable), conditions of life (from birth
to reference
      year of 3237)
 Pictures (?)
 MUCKs character is on (if applicable)
 Short Stories (including major parts to minor mentions) that the character
appears
      in (concentrating on the SatAM-modeled stories, not the Alternate
Universe series)
 Copyright Credits (name of creator and date for character)
 Creator's web page (if applicable)

-Sonic FAQ (HTML version):  Yes, I know, what I used to have on my homepage is
 WAY out of date, but I'm working on a fully HTMLed (and updated) version of
it now. 
 One question:  put it at my university site and connect it via the Sonic
Net page, or
 give it to Ratman to put at his site (since he has the majority of the
Sonic data anyway)?

-Technical Manual (guess who :) ):  OK..."Evolution of a Predator" went too
far into the
 technology theme, and I need something available for those who are
interested in David's
 functionality and to provide technical background for stories (in order to
keep everything
 in line on what David has).  I've had this idea kicking around for a while,
and I wanted to
 get a consensus on what YOU think of it.

That's all for now...email me your comments, or meet me on the MUCKs and
we'll talk.

HI. My name is John Bintz.  I've been reading the messages
here for about two weeks, and in that time, I have
completed a really nice pic of Bunnie and Tails that
I've put on the rat.org server (actually, Dave Pistone
did it for me.  It's on his pics_fan page).  Any
comments are welcome, as long as they are nice.
Thank you.

P.S.:More are coming...

P.P.S:It's in sonic/drawn/ and called bhug.gif.

I'm not sure what you're asking here.  Do you want opinions on "Evolution 
of a Predator", or on something else?  If the former, I'm afraid I didn't 
care for "Evolution".  It has too much of a "Star Trek" influence to it 
(warp nacelles, etc...) and not much happened in it.  

On the other hand, I really loved your story "The Temporal Syndrome".  It's 
ending had me in denial for weeks!  Also, "Temporal Syndrome" explored the 
relationship between Sonic and Sally in some depth, which I liked.  "Evolution"
just didn't hold my interest like that one did.

Hi!

Just wanted to clarify what I was looking for in one of my crazy ideas (this was
prompted by a piece of email I received):

As for the technical manual, I want to get a concensus on what the Sonic Net
populace thinks (should I make a technical manual for David available, or no?)
That's what I had in mind (sorry if the wording was a bit vague. :) )

Sonic Icons:

A while back someone had posted small binhex'ed files called
 KNUKICON.ICO
  SONICON.ICO
 TAILICON.ICO
I forgot who posted them (I deleted the original file after doing BINHEX 
conversions).  I was wondering how I go about viewing or installing these.
Also.. are these Windows icons or Mac icons?  (I can't figure out how to
get them to work on the Mac.. and I've never seen BINHEX used for IBM files
before.

Archie Sonic 29:

There's been a bit of discussion (here and on alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog)
about this comic.  Despite the fact that I didn't like her annoying voice 
on the Sat AM cartoon, I'm glad to see she's finally made it to the comics.

I'm however disappointed with how Roboticized-Sally was drawn.  I was 
expecting her to look either like the Sat-AM version of Roboticized-Sally
(as seen in Sonic's Nightmare) or like the cover drawing.

I like Quozl's suggestion for keeping Fiona the Robot Fox (was that her 
name?  I'm suddently not sure).  She'd be an interesting addition to the
freedom fighters.

Else:

I think I finally came up with an idea for a Sonic the Hedgehog story!
Now if I can ever find the time to write the whole thing.  Right now its
just a sketchy outline of a plot.

Archie's explanation for Tail's age changing was pretty contrived and 
really stretching it :)  How about this for an alternate explanation:

  He's really 4 years old but he's '10' in 'fox years'.

A friend of mine found an unlabled CD full of 80's 'Sci-Fi' tv-show theme
songs which we were trying to identify (what was that stupid show with the
300mph motercycle?)... anyway... while listening to the 'Airwolf' theme
song I had visions of an adult 'Tails'.  He might be fun to see in a story
(BTW.. the story idea I came up with does NOT involve an adult Tails)

FTP to rat.org and go into
/pub/sonic/

and look around there.

I have the .ICO versions of all those files, as well as GIF versions at 
/pub/sonic/images/icons/

You should have looked there before posting to the list.

Posting binaries to this list is against the rules, so I have the FTP site.
Any files posted here, I have put to the FTP site anyway.

They were Windows icons.  You can get fully extracted, binary versions of 
these icons from the rat.org ftp site.  OS/2 conversions are also 
available on the ftp site.  I don't recall the procedure for using custom 
icons under Windows and Win-OS/2 (I do it so rarely) but I can help 
anyone with using them in the Workplace Shell.  Send any such queries 
directly to me, not to the list.

As a reminder, binary files are not to be posted to the mailing list 
(small ANSI pictures excepted).  This is clearly stated in the new 
subscriber intro text sent to recent new subscribers and posted to the 
list for earlier subscribers.  The person who posted the message 
containing the BinHex files was advised to stop posting binary files to 
the list.

Hmmm, I was thinking of something to the affect of a character list, too,
but got "too busy" what with some other Sonic stuff I've been working on.
I should be contributing some stories soon; I just could use a bit of help
regarding the deal with the years (I haven't really been able to get the
hang of that).

Yes, it's me again.  And yes, I've got my sophomore effort ready for your

those lovely plot twists that I so enjoy.

Enjoy!

to tree, looking for a meal.  Fish lept out of the water to consume the
early-morning cloud of gnats that hovered above the life-giving fluid.  
These were the usual sounds of the morning, that had been heard on Mobius 
since time primeval...except for one.

Deep within the forest, within a mist-covered clearing, a figure silently
began his morning exercises.  He stretched and flexed his muscles, allowing
sinew to slip pass bone in the proper fashion.  He concentrated on the task
at hand as he took the traditional fighting stance.  He prepared himself 
for the physical exertion that was about to occur.  Centering himself 
spirtually and mentally as best he could, he locked onto his target and 
readied himself to the mission he had dedicated himself to.

About 10 feet away from the solitary figure, there was set up a 6" thick
piece of wood, cut into the rough shape of a very fat human.  It had a
target painted on the side of it, with its center resting in the middle
of the human's stomach.  It also had a cariacture of a smiley-face pasted
over where the head usually would be, with a bullethole through it.

After taking a deep breath, he began the exercise.

He did a series of forward flips toward the target.  But just as he came
into range, he vaulted over it, into the forest.  He hurtled toward a 
nearby oak, but precisely compensated for the change in course and 
lept off its trunk toward a vine.  He swung on the vine until he reached 
another tree.  He slid down the tree, cartwheeled away from it, and 
tucked into a spinning roll toward the target.  But again, as he became 
in range of it, he lept over it.  This time, he chose to grab a branch of 
the oak and did some various acrobatic exercises around it.  After he had 
orbited the appendage a few times, he quickly began crossing the clearing 
by pulling himself from various vines.  After a bit of this, he lept off 
one on the furthest side of the clearing, reversed himself in mid-air, 
and began cartwheeling, and then backflipping, toward the target for the 
final time.  When he entered attack range, he set up a perfect roundhouse 
kick, and beheaded the silly-looking dummy.  Immediately recovering from 
that, he executed a precise low punch to the target's main target, 
putting a fist-sized hole in the bullseye.

With the target destroyed, the figure stepped back, took a deep breath, and
calmly cleaned up the remains of the target.  He broke it up into portable
strips, wrapped them into a bundle, and walked back off into the forest,
his morning exercises completed for the day.

The figure, now having a good pile of firewood to use, wandered back toward
a path that had been beaten years ago to a village where he now resided. 
He had not been born in this village, nor even this world, but he had, just
from his brief time there, come to consider his new surroundings to be his 
home.  After all, his old home was no longer very hospitable; nor had it
been close to such a good training area as the one he had come from even
when it was.  

He drew closer to the outskirts of the village, where his hut resided.  He
had built it himself several days ago, and he cared for it dearly.  It was
probably the most comfortable, warm, and homey home in the entire village,
thanks to the advantage of the advanced technology he had utilized in its
construction.  Within 2 days, it came to stand as it did that day,
beautiful and tranquil in the gentle light of the sun.

Joseph loved his new home.

The entire structure took up less that 10 feet in diameter to the naked
eye.  It was dome-shaped, and appeared to be constructed of a sort of
opaque brown glass, that perfectly camoflaged the structure from the air.  
Occasionally, there was a clearer spot that served as a window.  A small
chimney stuck out from the right side of the dome, giving it a even more
surreal appearance.  However, a ordinary-looking native sidewalk led from 
an area a few feet from the home to its front portal.

To him, it was a "little cottage" that his people could have generated in 5
minutes; it had taken him several days to properly replicate all of its
features with the small amount of power left on his ship.  To the
inhabitants of this planet, however, it appeared as a wonder of the world;
a nigh-invulnerable fortress that no evil could breach.  Well, at least
nothing on this world could, Joseph thought.

Smiling, Joe meandered toward the sidewalk he had constructed, and walked up
it back toward his front door.  Opening it with a single word, he strode in to
unload the pelf he had carried from deep within the Great Forest, and to
clean himself up for the day.  Placing the bundle of firewood in the
fireplace, he shut the door behind him to consider the state of the home
Joseph had constructed with his own paws.

It was a tidy home, being spartanly furnished with only a few chairs, a
couch, and a practically empty bookshelf.  A monitor displayed the area
outside his house on a screen to the left of his door, with a small speaker
beneath it that served as an intercom.  The floor was hard wood, but the
walls were constructed with the same glassy material that the exterior
possessed.  A few windows allowed light to drift in from the outside, and 
a hallway led off in front of him to the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.  
Next week, Joseph thought, he would furnish the bare basement with a
laboratory, so to make his time here more constructive.  

But, for the time being, he was content with what he had.  However, he was
hungry, and his organics could use some hydrogen combined with oxygen in a
liquid state at roughly 40 degrees.  So not to lessen the ship's energy 
further by replicating food for him, he decided he would cook up some 
"grub" (as the blue one called it) for breakfast.  His organic systems 
would certainly appreciate it, after the workout Joseph had recently put 
them through.

He walked into the kitchen, and pulled out a object that served as a rough
"mug".  It was actually a hollowed-out sapling stump he had found a 
few days after he had "decided" to stay here, but he had sanded, 
shellacked, and generally waterproofed the thing enough so it would be a
decent container for food, drink, and such.  Smirking bitterly, Joe chided
himself for taking all of his tools with him from Ur'thae, but none of 
his utensils.  He grabbed it by its handle (a bent piece fof metal he had
stripped from the ruined communications array, screwed tightly into the 
side of the glass) and walked over to the sink.  

The fact that this cottage had running water was one of its main advantages
over several of the other huts around.  Instead of going over to the well
like the natives did, he had brilliantly chose to directly tap the water
table, using some tubing he was able to replicate.  He had "zapped"
(another colloquialism taken from the blue one) a hole through the ground
to the area below the village that the well drew its fluid from, and 
installed a long pipe into it.  Then, he set up a pipe that released
the wastewaster from the home, placed a purifier onto it, and had the
output flow into a creek.  Finally, he created a compressor unit (powered
by some ultra-efficient solar panels implanted in the roof), and
placed it on the pipe so it would draw water up from the underground
reservoir, and into his home.

After he had drank a few glasses of water, he walked over to one of the
cubbords and removed a small, metal can.  Then, he took a iron-copper 
alloy pot from the counter (he had smelted it himself only a week ago),
and walked off into the den.

He took a match from the shelf as he walked in, and struck it on a coarse
part of the glass wall.  Tossing it onto the wood, he waited until it
started to catch before opening the flue.  Then, Joe dumped the contents of 
the can (beans, apparently) into the pot, and placed it over the fire.  
Putting it on a stand, he hit a small switch by the fireplace to activate
the air filter at the summit of the chimnney.  He wouldn't want any aerial
scans to pick Knothole up, after all.  

Estimating the time for the contents of the pot to properly cook at 10.4532
minutes, he decided to try and squeeze in his shower before breakfast.  He
wandered into the bathroom, removed his training gear, and activated the
makeshift shower.

A blast of cold water slowly sublimated to cool as the figure gave himself
a through scrubbing.  His mind began to loosen up as he mulled over the
tasks he had to accomplish that day.  The only thing he needed to do was 
get more things from the ship.  Joe also wanted to study more throughly the
behavior patterns of the Mobians, and observe a "power ring" being formed.
Nothing earth-shattering, but enough to keep his mind busy.

He finished his shower and walked into a drying stall.  A 10-second blast
of specially charged atoms later, and he was dry.  Then, he put on some 
clean clothes, and checked on the progress of his breakfast.  Ah, he
thought as he reentered the den, the beautific stench of bubbling beans 
before brunch.  They were just about done, and done precisely the way he
liked them; hot.  Taking a bowl from the counter, he poured some of the
contents of the pot into it, and quickly placed the pot on a rack where 
it would not damage the rest of the area.  After he had accomplished that, 
he took a small wooden spoon from one of his pockets, picked up the
steaming bowl of legumes, and walked back outside.

Knothole was looking particularly wholesome today, Joseph thought as he
continued eating his beans.  It must be a psychic counterbalance to the
evil of Robotropolis, he assumed, and took another mouthful.  He strode 
along the main "street" of the village, looking for any signs of activity. 
Most of the village was still asleep.  Joseph noted again that the village 
was usually completely shut down from roughly midnight to about 6:15 in the
morning.  He hoped to one day be able to pin down the total time of 
dormancy to milliseconds.  But, that would not be today.  He sensed
activity coming from one of the huts.  He believed it was of the entity
called "Tails"; a pre-adolescent two-tailed fox that Joseph liked a great
deal.  Joe saw a lot of himself when he was that age in him.  Intelligent,
polite, inquisitive, yet somewhat naive.  But that was to be expected.
He sensed that Tails would one day be a very important individual in the
future of this world.  Then, he noticed Tails slowly wander out of his hut.
He wasn't quite awake yet, so Joseph chose to avoid him until he became 
fully sentinent.  (Joseph had also noticed very few Mobians were "morning
people".)

Continuing his walk through the village, he noticed that Sally had
obviously been active almost as long as he had.  Sally was also a person
Joseph could somewhat identify with.  She was a driven individual, very
buisness-like and unrelenting in her pursuits.  Yet, she could be
excessively kind and warm to someone as well.  Being the proper ruler of
Mobius, Joe reasoned, she must feel a great responsibility for the welfare
of the remaining, non-robotizied citizens of Mobius.  She was currently
preparing breakfast for herself and Tails, and was probably expecting Sonic
to come along, too.  She was obviously busy, so he quietly slipped by her
hut and furthered himself along his way.

Rotor was just finishing his breakfast, Joseph noticed as he walked by his
hut.  He was one of the rare people Joseph could talk shop with, and have
the other party reply in kind.  They both loved to fix things, build
things, and make objects more efficient.  He respected Rotor a great deal.
In fact, Joseph thought, he was coming to feel Rotor was the brother he 
never had.  He decided to drop by his hut, and see how he was.

Rotor waved to the tall, orange vulpine as he ducked his way inside his
hut.  "Hey, Joe." he said, as he gestured for Joseph to take a seat.  
"How are you doing this morning?"

"Oh," Joe said, "I'm just fine.  I was just going on a walk around the
village when I noticed you were awake.  Got up early today, eh?"

"Me?  Nah," Rotor said, "this is the time I like to get up.  I feel more
creative at either the extreme beginning of the day, or the middle of the
night.  Figured I might come up with something new to make."  He sighed.  
"I've been in a bit of a dry spell lately.  I don't know, maybe I've been
working too hard."  

Joseph smiled.  "I wouldn't worry too much about it, Rotor.  Everyone has
their ups and downs.  Just relax and let it happen."

Rotor was about to say something else when a shout echoed through the hut. 
"Rotor!!" a female voice yelled, "Muh arm is stuck again!"  Rotor looked
over at his guest.  "Oh jeez," he muttered, "Bunnie's arm locked up again. 
I just don't know what she does to it to kink it up so much."  He looked
out the door and yelled, "Be right there!".  

Joseph smirked.  "It's okay, Rotor.  Go do what you must do.  I'm gonna
keep walking around the complex, anyway."  Rotor nodded, and rushed out 
the door, tools in hand.

Joseph walked out of the hut, continuing to eat his beans.  After walking
another brief distance, he came across Antoine's impeccibly maintained hut.
Antoine was one of the Mobians Joe could only identify with by means of
extreme metaphor; both he and Antoine were out of place here.  But even 
then, it was stretching the comparison a tad far, because Antoine was 
alien even to people who had known him since birth.  At least to fellow
Ur'thaens he was normal...on the eastern continent.  He listened, and 
realized Antoine was still grooming himself.  It seemed like every time 
Joseph saw him, he was grooming himself.  Wouldn't his skin start to hurt 
after a while?  Honestly, he thought, his fur should be like silk from all
of the combing and primping that it had to endure.  He decided to leave 
before he started talking to him in that strange alteration of Mobian he 
was fluent in...

Suddenly, he heard the sound of a fast-moving individual zipping around a
few huts down.  Sonic had finally woken up, and he was doing his morning
"juice run" to wake himself up.  Seconds later, the blue blur blasted by
him, causing a large cloud of dust to fly into Antoine's hut.  

Antoine staggered out of the hut, coughing.  "Sonick!  I'll get vous for
zat!"  He gesticulated blindly back toward his dusty hut.  "It will take me
the days to clean dis up again!"  Joe took this opportunity to leave, while
Antoine was still blinded by the plume of dust.  He was still shouting when
he got out of range of his bellowing, and wandered back into the forest.  

Ah, the quiet of the forest, Joe thought, finishing his beans.  He walked
up to a stream and rinsed out his bowl in it.  Drying it off with his
shirt, he put it in one of his larger pockets and continued on his way.
He looked up into the sky.  By the position of the sun, he'd say it was
about 8:25.  Just about time for a power ring.  He started walking up the
path to the power ring pool, where Sonic would probably end up shortly.

He walked over to the pool, and took a seat on a rock.  He looked into the
pool.  A dull yellow glow was visible near the bottom of the pool.  The
ring would surface in 3.4 seconds.  He was expecting to hear the sound of 
the hedgehog roar up here, snatch the ring, and zip off again.  However, he
must have been delayed, because the ring rose unaccompanied by a blue
flash.  It was floating there, waiting for someone to grab it.  Joseph
realized someone better grab it before it sank again.  He reached out his
hands--suddenly, four words drifted in front of him, a warning message--

<< DIRECTIVE TWENTY SIX ALPHA >>

--and his body catapaulted itself back into the bushes.  A second later,
Sonic blasted up the path, grabbed the ring, and rushed back to Knothole
before he could even notice the orange heap laying in the woods.   Joseph
groaned from the sudden automatic movement, and stumbled to his feet.  What
had just happened?  Had the power from the ring shorted out his neural net?
If it had, then what did that message mean?  Joseph was confused.  He
needed to ask Bahb about this.  He ran back into Knothole, and was
beginning to worry about the new development..
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

He jogged back toward his home.  Trotting through the village, he was
unnoticed by the inhabitants, who were busy starting their chores for the
day.  Then, a voice called his name.  "Joseph!" the voice shouted, "could
you come here for a minute?"  It was Sally.  Wondering what she needed of
him, he walked toward her hut.  

Entering the hut, he realized Sonic, Sally, and Tails were in the middle of
breakfast.  Tails was sitting on the left side, and Sonic was on the right.
Sally was sitting on the far end.  It was apparently oatmeal with 
strawberries today.  It looked rather appetizing.  Tails waved to Joe as 
he walked in, unable to talk with his mouth full of whitish slush.  Sonic 
had, naturally, completed his bowl, and was somewhat more talkative.
"Yo, Joe." he said to the tall fox as he ducked his way into the home.

"Greetings, boss." Joe jokingly called Sally `boss' because of a
translation problem he had initally had with the word "princess".  In
Ur'thaen, the word "p'hrincese" meant "overlord"; seeing that Sally was not
the current overlord of Mobius, he had taken the next logical step and
called her by a synonym of "overlord", "bhoss".  Later, when he had
consulted Sonic about it, he realized the error.  Sonic and Sally 
smirked as Joe then proceeded, as usual, to bow slightly.

"You can just call me Sally, Joseph." Sally laughed, "There's no need for
such formality."  She gestured for him to sit in the vacant chair at the
close end of the table.  As he sat down, Sally continued talking.  "So," he
spoke, "how are things going for you here?  Do you need anything?" 

Joseph smiled.  "I require nothing," he said, "I have everything I need to
survive on my ship.  I can imbibe Mobian water, and consume Mobian food. 
My home has been constructed, so all I require of you now," He smiled and 
winked at Sally.  "Is your kindness."

Sonic quipped, "We've got that in high supply, dude."

Joseph grinned at the blue mammal.  "I figured as much.  You have been so
kind to me, I don't know how to make it up to you."

"Well," Sally interjected, "there *is* something we'd like to ask you." 
She looked over at Sonic.  "Sonic, why don't you do the honors?"

Sonic smirked.  "Sure, Sal.  Joe, my man, why don't you join us in our
fight against ol Ro-BUTT-nik?  You've got serious skills."

"It would be an honor," Joseph bowed, "to assist you in the uprising
against him.  Any assistance you require of me would be gladly given."

Sally smiled weakly.  "That's...uh, great, Joseph!  I didn't think you'd 
be so enthusiastic about this.  After all, you don't live here.  This 
isn't your fight."

"It's mine now." he said plainly.

Sally blinked.  "Are you sure you want to get into this?"

Before Joe could answer, Sonic interjected, "Sal, whaddya tryin' to do,
change his mind?!?"

"Sonic," Joe said, "I decided to help you the minute you people helped me.
I have no home to return to.  This is my world now, and I shall defend it."

Suddenly, Tails, who had been quietly eating his breakfast for most of this
conversation, chose to state, "But Mr. Joseph, I thought you could leave 
here at any time.  Didn't you say all you needed was more crystal power to
escape?"

The orange fox turned to the younger, two-tailed one, and then to the two
adults.  "Tails," he spoke, "Sonic, Sally...let me explain my prediciment 
to you all."  He stood up, and went into speech mode.

"My world was merely a more positive reflection of what Robotnik wants
Mobius to be.  Our people gave up their flesh in return for immortality.
Sure, there was no pollution, death, disease, or famine; but Ur'thae also
lacked peace.  The flesh battled steel.  Religion fought science.  Brother
dueled brother...all over the quest for eternal consciousness.  The only way
my planet lasted for as long as it did after the creation of the neural
transfer device was because of the continental division."

"The first part of my life, I saw this war from Robotnik's side 
(to a certain extent).  Now, I live among the flesh, and I see that my
father was the creator of an evil too great for mortals to handle; affordable 
immortality.  At first, it seems to have no downsides.  Improved strength,
speed, senses, agility, and your mind never loses its edge.  You can
continue learning and experimenting for aeons.  The pleasures of the flesh
never dull...in fact, they sharpen due to computerized enhancement."

"But, my father never realized that someone could use this ability for evil
purposes...to enslave another by "roboticizing" (as a somewhat similar
practice is called here) him or her.  He never saw that a part of ones
nature would rebel against it, and eventually even out the score.  They 
escaped death for a while, but in the end they all paid the ultimate
price for their crime against nature." 

"No, it is better to die in the flesh than live forever in steel.  I will
fight Robotnik for you because of this...he has tried to duplicate my
father's formula for immortality by using Sir Charles'--your uncle,
Sonic--roboticizer.  But he poisons himself and others by this...he has his
slaves, but he realizes not that the flesh and steel cannot live in the
same body.  If he is not stopped, this world will suffer the fate of
Ur'thae; a Fountain of Youth powered by blood."  

"So, Sally, I offer my services to you.  Command me, and I will comply. 
Robotnik must be stopped.  At this point, all else is irrevelant."

Sally, Sonic, and Tails could only blink.

"Joseph," Sally whispered, "you are gladly accepted into the Freedom
Fighters.  I see now that you are honest in your statements.  Your services
to us will be valued."

Joseph bowed.  "Thank you, Sally.  May I be excused?"

Sally nodded, and Joseph left the hut silently.

After he had gotten out of earshot, Sonic whispered, "Man!  That guy is
intense!"

Sally nodded.  "Yes, Sonic...he is certainly driven.  He must feel he has a
whole world to avenge."

"I'd say!" Tails piped, "I can't wait to see what HE does to 'Butt-nik."

Sonic muttered, "So do I, Tails.  He looks like he could do some *serious* 
damage to some SWAT Bots."

"I wonder what's going through his mind right now?"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

He continued back toward the dome that served as his domicile.  The brief
interlude with the leaders of the FF didn't make Joseph forget what had
happened by the power ring pool.  It intrigued him.  Could it be that this
planet had a power source greater than his internal power core?

He entered the dome and walked over to the now-smoldering remains of his
fire.  He tossed the bowl on the table, and walked over to the Bahb 27290-A
Unit, affectionately known as Bahb.  

"Bahb," he said, "I need info.  Talk to me."

"Ready for command."

"Define Directive 26-Alpha."

Bahb hummed quietly for a minute.  "Classified.  Cannot access externally."

"Surmise a hypothesis on how to acquire this information."

Bahb beeped and tweeted as it ran through every possibility.  "Required
materials are on the ship."

"What do I need?"

Bahb began rattling off names of various components within the ship.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Over the next few days, the village eyed their new arrival suspiciously.
His main occupation seemed to be removing all of his computer equipment
from the ship he had crashed in, and installing them in the basement of 
his amazing home.  He would say what his purposes were, nor why he did not
keep them on the ship.  Some believed he was going to sabotage Robotropolis
completely.  Others, that he was going to destroy Robotnik's communications
grid.  A few just thought he was finishing unpacking; but everyone had an
opinion.  

Joseph was, in actuality, preparing his new computer lab for two reasons;
to continue his work, and to discover the secret of Directive 26-Alpha.
Joe also could no longer leave all of his hyperadvanced technology in the
middle of the woods in good faith...the ship had drove off several gawkers
in the last few days.  But he told no one of his experience at the power 
ring pool, nor of the mysterious malfunction.

Finally, 4 days later, the ship was totally gutted of its vital systems,
and was nothing more than a husk of its former self.  It was still cloaked,
but there was no longer any point in trying to steal it.  Joseph had
installed the power cells of the ship in the basement of his home, as well
as the communications systems and the main computer.  His domicile was now
a flightless version of the ship he had entered this world with.  A few 
more mining expeditions gave Joseph as much power as he could possibly use,
and then some, and he had tuned the house itself into a large antenna.  

He was finally ready to attempt to find out the secret behind the
directive.  Preparing the dataspike, he sat down in a chair he had created
for this purpose, and jacked in.  Taking a deep breath, he prepared for the
total discombobulation that was to come with the scan.

"Bahb," he said again, "define Directive 26-Alpha."

"Accessing, Jo--."

There was a great flash of light.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

When he could see again, Joseph found himself standing on the shore of the
Iundaeck Ocean, in front of the home he and his father shared back on
Ur'thae.  The twin moons shone down upon him in that glorious,
awe-inspiring violet sky.  The water was as clear and glowing as the first
day he had set eyes upon it.  The blue sand blew by his legs as the cry of
a lark whistled through the air, invigorating him.

He was home again.

<<"Jhosesophae.">> a voice said.  Turning around to face the voice, he
knew for sure this was his home.

<<"Dhaevid?">>

The male was about as tall as Jhosesophae, with reddish-orange fur.  His
yellowing eyes denoted youth, yet the streaks of white in the fur showed
great age.  He was wearing a yellow lab coat, the mark of the Scientist
Prime on Ur'thae.  However, beneath the uniform, there was a pair of simple
slacks and a sweater, and a pair of whitish tennis shoes.  His hands were
metallic versions of the ones Jhosesophae had, but the voice was strictly
the unique baritone of his father's.  

<<"Yes, Jhosesophae.  This is me.  At least, a composite image of me strung
together from your own memory banks.">>

<<"I don't understand.">>

<<"Let me explain, Jhosesophae.">>

The world flickers for a minute, and then switches to a different scene.
The scene now is of the room Joseph was transferred in, and the spaceship
docking ramp that was its only exit.  Dhaevid is typing something into a
keyboard while the android body is recieving its intelligence.

<<"Your story begins here, Jhosesophae.  While you were being transferred
to your new body, I was pre-programming your ship to take you to the planet
where you now reside...Mobius.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  I should
explain to you how I discovered this world, first.">>
	
The world flickers again.  The picture returns on a starfield, where an
Ur'thaen ship is cloaking itself around an orbit of Mobius.  <<"I
discovered intelligent life here shortly before your 16th birthday. 
Utilizing time warps, I was able to commute to Mobius and back home several
times a month without being noticed.  I was studying their advancement,
and...helping it a little.">>  Scene cuts to the workshop of Sir Charles
Hedgehog, and Dhaevid sneaking into it late at night.  <<"One specimen 
interested me especially.  His name was "Charles".  He was beginning to 
develop the technology that had made the neural transfer device possible...
the roboticizer.  A similar technology was developed by your grandfather 
356 years ago...anyway, every once in a while, I would sneak into his 
workshop and alter some of the equations to assist in the advancement of 
this technology.  He had the basic idea, but every once in a while he 
would make an unintentional error due to the misguided scientific theory 
of the time that I would quietly get him out of.">>

Scene cuts to Sir Charles constructing the device used to generate power
rings.  <<"But, Sir Charles had also stumbled upon something that was far
beyond Ur'thaen technology.  This was the Power Ring Generator.">>  Scene
cuts to a diagram of the device, showing various graphs and projected power
fluxations next to it.  <<"From my observations of Sir Charles' tests, this
device had the potential to generate enough power to penetrate the 
dimentional barrier; the one thing Ur'thaens could never breach, if
harnessed in the correct manner.  I'll tell you the truth, son, I have no 
idea how, why, or if it even *should* work.  Only the hedgehog knows.">>

The scene cuts to a picture of Sir Charles on the left, Sonic on the right,
and a power ring in the lower center.  <<"This brings me to my final
request of you, my son.  Your mission is threefold; first, you must find 
Sir Charles, and assist him in any way he requires.  Work with him.  
Understand his devices.  This will allow you to escape the bonds of this
dimention, and become the first, and only, Ur'thaen to explore the other
universes that have been proven to exist.  Your second mission is to find
the nephew of Sir Charles, Sonic.  He can use the rings, according to Sir
Charles' notes and hypotheses, and perhaps he could teach you how to
properly use them as well.  Your final mission is to acquire
a power ring for yourself, and learn how to replicate more.  They are the
only way you will be able to travel from timestream to timestream safely
and efficiently.">>

The scene cuts back to the beach.  <<"This is all you need, or can know 
right now.  Alas, I know no more than this; my observation of Mobius was
cut short by the destruction of our world.  Good luck, my son; the last
survivor of Ur'thae.">>

<<"But..">>

Everything went black.

"Scan complete."

Joseph opened his eyes, and detached from the datajack.  Groaning, and
rubbing his throbbing skull, he spoke.  "Computer, time elapsed from
beginning of scan to its completion."

"1 minute."

"Deactivate dataspike."

The system powered down.  Joseph laid back in his chair.  The situation had
changed considerably.  Now he knew why the power ring had effected him, but
a million other questions came to mind...

After musing this over for a minute, he knew what he had to do.  Organizing
it into his directives list, he began to estimate how to best accomplish
them...

Priority One:   Find Sir Charles.
Priority Two:   Find Sonic.
Priority Three: Acquire power ring; experiment.

He had already guarenteed himself two and three just by being at Knothole.
However, he had never heard of Sir Charles being about.  This was
illogical; Sonic and Charles were family, and therefore Sonic wuld
probably, according to his observations, either find some way of honoring
him (if was deceased), or he would have brought him back to Knothole.  

Seeing that he was missing something, he decided to confront Sonic about
the issue after dinner that night.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

After Knothole had been fed, Joseph wandered the village, looking for
Sonic.  He finally encountered the blue blaze sitting quietly by the power
ring pool, looking into the sky.  Realizing that Sonic was observing the
three moons of Mobius, he allowed him a few moments of silence before he
finally piped up.

"Where's Sir Charles, Sonic?"  Joesph was always direct in his questioning.

"My unc's in Buttnikville, Joe." Sonic said, quietly.

"Why is he there?  I thought you'd try to get someone as brilliant as...I
heard he is...out of Robotnik's clutches."

"He's our spy, Joe.  He hangs out, acts like a drone, but tells us
all about what happens there."  He glanced at his hands, dusting them off.

"Oh," Joesph said.  "Wait a minute, I thought everyone in Robotropolis was
roboticized."  

"They all are." Sonic spake.

"Well, how does your uncle spy on Robotnik if he doesn't have free will?"

"He's got his brain," said Sonic, turning toward him.

"I don't understand."

"Look," Sonic said, "My unc's been snapped out of Buttnik's control 'cuz I
waved a power ring in front of his face.  It somehow rewired his 'ol head
back to where it should be, and now he's cool."  He looked back to the
moons.  "And someday," he whispered, "he will be totally cool again."

"Now I understand," Joesph said, "but it's too bad he's in Robotropolis. 
I'd like to meet him."

Sonic smiled.  "Well, Joe, you'll be able to see him tomorrow night, when
he sneaks out of Buttnikville and gives us the weekly gossip.  You can chew
his ear off then, 'kay?"

"Sure." Joseph said, smiling.  "Thanks a lot."

"No prob," Sonic said, and went back to staring off into space.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The next morning, Joesph went about his training as usual, but the whole
while was thinking of how to explain to Sir Charles his prediciment without
alerting the rest of Knothole about it.  Surely if they knew they had been
visited by aliens for several months without being told, they would become
somewhat alarmed.  He knew the Ur'thaen governments wouldn't like it, so it
was without a stretch of the imagination that the Mobian government (the
real one) wouldn't appreciate it, either.  No, he did not want them to 
know anything about his father, the message he left, and the mission he 
was given until it was time.  Charles would understand.  He was sure of it.
They were fellow scientists, after all, and he felt that Charles might have
done the same thing if he was in his father's place.

He spent most of the day meditating on what he would say to Charles.  He
wanted to be sure he knew exactly what had happened, and would therefore be
able to make an informed decision about what to do about it.  He mentally
composed a rather simple, logical essay on the whole situation, and
translated it into a speech that Charles could easily understand.  Then, he
reviewed it, looked for possible misperceptions, and altered them into a
more logical structure.

When Charles arrived that night, Joseph was ready.  He let the aged
metallic hedgehog inform Knothole of what had been going on over the past
several days in Robotropolis, focusing mainly on something called Doomsday.
Joe stayed out of it, hoping to avoid becoming involved for as long as
possible.  He knew that one day his powers would be called upon, but he did
not want to get mired in this world's mess unless he knew that he would
have to remain here.  

After Charles had finished, and the Knothole gang was involved in planning,
the eldest hedgehog politely excused himself, and began the long trip back
to Robotropolis on foot (Sonic couldn't zip him back, due to the amount of
security that had been placed around the area as of late.) Joseph began
following him.  Finally, after they had gotten out of visual range of
Knothole, he made himself visible to the kindly cyberhedgehog.

"Excuse me, but I need to tell you something."

Charles lept back, startled.  "Oh!"

"Please excuse my abrupt appearance, sir.  It is my custom to remain silent
unless absolutely necessary."

Charles quickly regained his composure, and his eyes took a more pleasant
shade of red, if that was even possible.  After shifting around a bit, he
spoke.  "Well," Charles said, "if it isn't our star-travelling newcomer.  
I'd be happy to talk with you, son, but I really need to get back to 
Robotropolis before Robotnik misses me..."

"This is important.  It involves you, Sonic, and your invention."

And then Joseph told him what he knew.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Charles could only blink.  "So, what you're saying is that your father -- uh,
David, right? -- was the one who allowed the Roboticizer to be `perfected'?"

Joseph nodded.

"And that the power ring generator is something beyond even your
technology, and you want to study it in order to further advance your dead
world's science?  You think it can help to deroboticize people?"

"Yes."

Charles began to lose his composure.  "Do you honestly expect me not to be
angered by this?"

"No..." Joseph uttered, becoming somewhat nervous.

"Good," Charles snarled, "because I am."    He balled his metallic hands
into fists, and shook them at Joesph irritatedly.  "Your father brought 
a curse upon this world by `helping' me create that damned machine! 
Millions perished because of its power!  Only a few hundred remain
untouched by its evil, and we lose more every day!"  He spat upon the
earth, and angrily pointed toward the distant outline of Robotropolis.  
"Is *that* what your world was like, Joseph?!?  A oligarchial `government' 
ruled by madmen, and supported by millions of robot slaves?  Is *that* 
what your superior world was like?  A souless, callous factory, existing
only to rape and loot your world?"  His eyes shrunk to slits, and turned
bright crimson.  "Is Robotnik merely a different version of your
*father*?!?" 

Joseph could withhold his rage no longer.  He had taken most of Charles'
outburst, but his slap at his father was unforgivable.  Raging, he
grabbed Charles by the throat, and lifted him high above his head.  As Charles
desperately tried to escape his grasp, and get some shots in, Joseph went
into a total spaz fit.  "Do you THINK I'm *happy* about what has happened
here?!?  Do you BELIEVE that my father MEANT to ruin this world?!  He 
wanted to *HELP* you, you dottering old fool, by teaching you how to 
overcome the weaknesses of the flesh; without losing its advantages!  Your 
society would be as it was 15 years ago if it wasn't for the fact your 
PATHETIC bodies weren't wired so TOTALLY different from ours!  It's not 
MY fault, or even my FATHER'S fault that this happened!  Nobody is at 
fault here but Robotnik!"  He looked toward the smoking, hazy industrial
hell, and shook Charles vigorously.  "Don't you SEE?!" he cried, "It was 
a tragic MISTAKE that the roboticizer was miswired for this world's 
inhabitants, and the drive of that sadistic egg-sucking simian that made 
it the menace it is now!!"

Having exhausted his venom, he glanced over at the creature he had
captured.  His eyes watered with the cybernetic equivilent of tears. 
"Boy...I'm sorry.  It's just that--"

Joseph lowered him to the ground, becoming suddenly calm.  "You don't 
need to apologize, sir.  I understand why you would have so much hatred 
for my father...it's just that, well, he and I were very close.  Ever since
I woke up here, I have had to deal with the grief of losing him, my 
friends, my world..."  He fell silent, and wiped tears from his eyes.  
"I don't want it to happen here, sir.  I'd never wish what happened to me 
on anyone...not even Robotnik."

Somberly dusting himself off, the robotic hedgehog sighed.  "I lost
control.  I shouldn't have snapped at you.  We both know that neither of us
are really at fault for what's happened here.  It's Robotnik who is to
blame.  He stole the plans, and he threw the coup.  Not me, not you, not
your father, but Robotnik."

"You must have lived with so much guilt...." Joseph whispered, "having to
have lived for so long with the assumption that the device was all your
own.  I can relate to your feelings now, but there is no time for therapy
now.  Your world will be decimated unless we can find some way of reversing
the effects of roboticization.  I want to, and must help."  He looked
toward a certain star.  "This is my home now."

They stared into the sky for an eternity.

"I will give you whatever you need, and assist you in any manner that I
can," said Charles, "and I promise you, none shall know of this until you
feel it is time."

"Thank you, Sir Charles."

"It's no problem, son."  They shook hands, nodded, and went their seperate
ways.  Now both had a new variable to deal with; and some new hope.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Over the next few days, Charles would sneak out to the edge of the Great
Forest, and give Joseph as much information as he possibly could about the
roboticizer Robotnik had as he could.  Diagrams, circuits, anything that
might be important to the process, Joseph had by the end of a few days. 
Comparing it to the roboticization process he was familiar with, he was
able to understand how far he had to go in order to reverse the process
sucessfully...in theory.  

However, he needed one of the power rings.  He couldn't just take one;
they'd ask what he wanted it for, and he didn't want to tell them yet.
Stealing one was out of the question.  He pondered this for a while.
Eventually, he simply moved on with his experiments by running simulations,
but they didn't have the important x-factor he needed calculated in; the
potential energy of a power ring.

He moped around the power ring pool whenever he wasn't working, dismally
looking down toward the generator.  Charles couldn't help him build a
replica of it, because he had to destroy the plans when Robotnik took over.
Thus, he was just going to have to wait a bit longer...but he hated
waiting!  Lives were at stake.  

One day, he just snapped.

He timed the exact generation of a power ring down to a second, and
prepared himself to grab it.  As it began its ascent, he heard Sonic
coming.  Quickly, he positioned himself in front of the pool, so Sonic
would have to go through him to get it.  When the ring crested the surface,
he grabbed it just as the hedgehog arrived.

"Hey, Joe!" he shouted, "Gimme that ring."

Joseph looked at him blankly.

"Well?  Give it."  He began to tap his foot impatiently on the ground.

Joseph was in a rough spot.  He needed the ring.  Sonic wanted the ring.
He couldn't deny him it; it was his birthright.  Yet, he needed the ring
in order to complete his experiment.  Would it be better to tell him now or
later?  What to d--?

"Be that way, then."  Quickly, Sonic jumped up and wrapped his hand 
around the ring, and attempted to snatch it from his hand...

And then, something quite unique happened.
  
The nova effect covered both Sonic and Joseph.  Levitating them both into
the air, it glowed brighter than it ever did before.  Lightning crackled
from the bubble as the wind began to be sucked into it, and a low roar was
beginning to be heard around the area...

There was a bright flash of light.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[Joseph's internal chronological record of the next day or so is somewhat
fuzzy.  The following log was given to the historial record from Joseph's
own auditory reception.  No visual records of this period exist.  
Time has been estimated to the nearest minute.]

+00 hours, 02 minutes

"Sonic!  Sally's look--oh muh stars!  HELP!!"

Static.

+00:03

"C'mon, help get him up, Rotor."

"Boy, he's heavy."

Static.

+00:10

"Do you think he'll be okay, Aunt Sally?"

"I don't know, Tails.  Maybe he just needs to rest."

Static.

+00:45 

"Joe!  C'mon, Joe, wake up!"

Static.

+01:25. 

"...he's got his eyes back..."

Static.

+02:00

"Ah cain't get into his house, Sally.  Bob's got it locked down."

"Can't you explain to it what's happ--"

Static.

+02:56

"See what I mean?  Every once in a while, his eyes wi--"

Static.

+05:15

"He still hasn't moved, Sal.  I think he's de--"

Static.

+08:02

"And there it goes again!"

"He's not dead.  He probably wishes he was, tho."

Static.

+20:35

"Still there?"

"I guess so.  Look at him twitch."

"Wait!  Don't pus--"

Static.

+40:00

"I'm not goin' in there, Sal, and you can't make me."

"But Sonic..."

Static.

+47:00

<<"Reboot completed.">>

"Sally..."

<<"Self-diagnositic cycle commencing.">>

"What is it, Rotor?"

<<"Repairs complete.">>

"Uhh...it's alive."

<<"Sensor reacclimation complete.">>

"Tails!  Get out of here, now!"

<<"All systems at 100%.">>

*sounds of people rushing out of the room*

<<"Visual systems reactivated.">>

Suddenly, all he saw was white as his visual sensors came back online.  In
a few seconds, they had properly reacclimated to the environment, and he
took some time to examine where he was.

It was a hut, plainly decorated and felt somewhat sterile.  It was empty,
save for a bed and the small cloud of dust that was drifting
around...obviously, from the rapid departure of several parties.  He felt
no offense by this; they were being cautious.

He hopped out of bed.  Standing upon the ground, he assumed that his
sensors were still malfunctioning; he felt about half his original height.
Activating his homing beacon, he began to follow the signal back to his
home, where he could do the necessary repairs.  He stumbled out of the hut,
and quickly did a scan.  Nothing.  They were all inside.  Seeing no
threats, he wandered back toward the trail that led back to his dome.

As he stumbled back up the sidewalk that led to his home, he noticed he had
a lot of excess energy.  He wanted to run up the sidewalk, rather than
safely walking.  He pushed those strange thoughts out of his mind as he
opened the portal and walked into his home.

A few minutes later, he was in his laboratory, and standing in the
diagnostic tube.  Activating the scan, he wondered what exactly had
happened to him.

"Joseph, sensors indicate a change on the subatomic level."

"Is it damaging?" Joseph was startled by the sound of his own voice.  It
sounded a lot like Sonic's.  The mimicry software was obviously still not
at 100%, he thought, and readjusted his voice (with some difficulty) 
back to the default.  

"Negative.  It has, however, increased your speed by 10,000%."

Joseph was surprised.  "Wow, that ring packs some punch." he uttered,
returning to his usual tone.  "What other changes have occured?"

"You have also begun to take on the characteristics of the entity called
Sonic the Hedgehog.  However, your internal systems are counteracting the
effects, and will have you internally back to default settings in another
day."  

Bahb paused briefly, and beeped.  "However, the visual effects are going 
to require additional power to counteract."

"What do you mean?"

"A visual apprasal has concluded that you appear to be Sonic."  

Joseph was shocked.  This was why everyone was so frightened before!  It
wasn't just a sensory error...

"However, several things about you are far different than him.  Your quills
are orange.  Your eyes are silver, with no pupils.  You're wearing boots."

Joseph was still in a daze.  "How...?"

"Unknown.  Hypothesis suggests that the power ring, being suited for
Sonic's DNA, caused your biological systems to take on his genetic code
when he activated it.  You were knocked mostly unconscious during the
shock, and your internal cybernetics rushed to keep up with your physical
mutations."

Joseph nodded, still in shock.  "Do you think I can ever return to original
form?"  

"Unknown.  Your inital transformation put a heavy strain on your internal
robotics.  It is very improbable that they could take such a strain again."

Joseph decided to get away from generalities, which were beginning to
frighten him, and get back to specific problems.  "Why are my eyes 
silver and pupilless, as you said before?"

"When the intial blast occured, it blasted your original eyes from your
sockets, being that you were at ground zero.  It took exactly one hour
twenty minutes for new eyes to be created, and for them to fill up your new
eye sockets.  Unfortunately, they are not visually pleasing yet, because
your nanite repair system is still finishing up your primary systems."

"This concerns me, Bahb."

"Affirmative.  However, it is a logical conclusion that you should probably
learn to cope with this form, because it's going to be yours for a while."

Joseph mulled this over.  "Yes, I suppose so."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

A few more days went by.  Every once in a while, someone from Knothole
would come by, and try to see if any movment from Joseph's dome was
detected.  And every time, they noted nothing.  All anyone could hear was a
low hum.  Since no communication had been heard from the dome, they were
beginning to wonder how he was.  Sonic felt especially guilty, 
since he appearently caused it.

"It's my fault he went all haywire," he would tell Sally at length.  "If I
wouldn'tve been in such a hurry, he'd still be around.  Now he's messed up
big time.  I wouldn't be surprised if he never came out again."

And, for a while, he seemed to be right.  Nobody could get in, and nobody
had left.  They mused on his status.  Some said he had gone in there to
die.  A few clung to the belief that he was creating a new body to return
to his original form.  Most people, however, couldn't come to a conclusion
at all.

Then, when they had almost lost all hope, the portal opened.  A figure 
left the dome, starting slowly, and then speeding up.  He went faster and
faster, and faster still.  When he reached the center of Knothole, a sonic
boom went off, and he roared through the forest toward the Great Jungle.  
Nobody had to say anything.  They knew what it meant.  Sally, after
glancing once at Sonic, knew exactly what was going to happen next.  
Seconds later, a second sonic boom went off, and both supersonic hedgehogs
were gone.  

They raced around Mobius, over water, land, and chasm.  They burrowed deep
into the earth, swung on vines, and lept high into the air.  Finally, they
reached the summit of the highest mountain, and stopped their relentless
pursuit of each other.

Joseph took a few breaths.  "You are fast." said the orange blur.

"So are you." said the blue.

"I suppose you'd like an explaination."

"Yes, that would be nice."

Joseph explained the entire preiciment to Sonic as best he could.
Trying to dumb it down enough for the relatively non-technical 
hedgehog, he tried to explain about his father, Sonic's uncle, and the 
power ring effect.

"So that's why you tried to steal that ring..."

"Yes," Joseph whispered, "that is why."

"I can see now why you wouldn't want to tell Sal and I about somethin' like
that.  Way past uncool."

"Yes, it is."  

"We wouldn't have hurt you for what your father did, Joe."

"I could not know that for sure," he gasped, taking in more oxygen.

"You couldn't have, could you?" Sonic mused.

Joseph nodded, and moved on to the next thing on his mind.  "I hope the 
blast didn't injure you."

"Nah," Sonic said, "it's cool.  Used up the whole ring, tho.  But I got
another one this morning."

"That's good."

"Yeah."

The wind whistled through their quills, but neither of them seemed to mind.

"Whaddya gonna do now, Joe?"

"I don't know.  I certainly can't help your world until I get my head
together.  I've seen too much in the last few days...I gotta go off and
think.  You can understand why."

"Yes," he nodded, "I can."

"I must go."

With that, Joseph rolled into a ball, and shot down the hill.  Sonic just
stood there, looking out toward the horizon, wondering...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

			      EPILOGUE

Sonic returned to Knothole a few hours later, after he had gotten his own
head together.  He realized how very confused Joseph must be at that
moment, and put together a proper fabrication to tell the rest of Knothole
about it.

He walked back to the edge of Knothole, where Sally was the first to 
confront him.  "Sonic?  Where's Joseph?  What happened?"

Sonic looked plainly back at Sally.  "He needs to be alone for a bit."

Sally gave Sonic a wicked look.  "I *knew* that, Sonic.  What I mean is,
what happened?  Where did you guys go?"

Sonic leaned up against the wall.  "Oh," he said, "we just ran around for a
bit."  

"For three hours?"

"It's a guy thing, Sal."

Sally started to become cross.  "Look, just tell me whether or not he's
coming back."

"I don't know, Sal.  He said he's all messed up, and he's gotta juice
around until he knows what time it is."

She sighed.  "Well, I hope he comes back before something major happens."

Sonic got up from against the wall, and put his arm around her shoulders.  
"He will, Sal.  He just needs to be alone for a while."

"But what if Robotnik captures him, and his technology falls into the wrong
hands?"  

Sonic suddenly began to smile.  "'Butt-nik isn't gonna catch him, Sal. 
He's the 2nd-fastest thing on Mobius."

Sally shot Sonic a faux-questioning look.  "And what, pray tell, is *the*
fastest thing on Mobius?"

"Want a hint?"

"Antoine?"

Sonic acted shocked.  "Oh, c'mon, Sal."

"But who could be faster?"

"A slug is faster than Antoine, Sal."

Sally giggled.  "Well, I suppose you're right.  C'mon, we better get back
to Knothole and explain what happened."

They wandered back to Knothole, wondering of their friend's fate.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

			      THE END?  (of course not)
