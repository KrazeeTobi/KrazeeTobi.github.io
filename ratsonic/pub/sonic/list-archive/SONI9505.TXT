Hello everyone,

	Just sent a new Sonic GIF to rat's FTP site, and is now waiting 
approval.  It is sort of a collage (sp?) type thing, with sonic in 
various poses.

	Hope this breaks the silence around here lately =)

Otherwise, I'm gone for the summer in a few weeks :(

I guess I'm in college.  Grad school is kinda funny though.  When you 
get far enough the concept of 'semesters' and the breaks between them
becomes rather meaningless.

On more relevent notes.

1) Comic News.
    Still no sign of that Sonic & Knuckles 48-page special from Archie.
    They also hinted at a miniseries including our favorite Happy Fun Fox
    [Miles 'Tails' Prower]. 

2) Sally.
    My roomate Matt and I are apparently having a bit of an argument as 
    to what species Sally is.  I'm in the 'Sally is a Squirrel like all
    the references say' crowd while Matt is in the 'Sally's got to be a
    fox' crowd.
    My point:  Its Sally 'Acorn'.  Foxes and acorns don't mix.
    His point: She looks like a fox...  Her dad's a fox. (i.e. The Void)
    My point:  Its a toon thing... besides... Archie and Sega apparently
               say she's a squirrel.
    His point: Where's her bushy tail?
    My point:  She's a ground squirrel (no bushy tail*).  Besides, wouldn't
               a fox also have a bushy tail?
    His point: I still think she looks like a fox.

2a) *Sally's tail (and possible lack of it).
    I've been thinking about this.  Maybe royalty (and those closely 
    associated with royalty) have their tails 'clipped' (like many
    german shepards and sheepdogs).  This might explain the lack of 
    Sally's tail (and possibly Antoine's as well).  I didn't notice..
    Did anyone see a tail on Sally's father?

    By the way.. the concept of Antoine 'giving' his tail to Tails is
    just plain goofy.  I don't buy it one bit :)

    Another possibility: Sally's tail might've been lost in a scuffle
    with Robotnik's forces ... I doubt this is a good reason because
    in that 'Blast from the past' episode we see she didn't have a 
    long tail even before Robotnik took over.

3) Sonic Stories.
    I've taken a couple of the Sonic stories from this list and formatted
    them nicely using MicroSquish Word 5.1 (Mac version).

    If I get around to doing a few more I could send out BINHEX'ed copies
    via e-mail or FTP to interested parties.

Where do you think mine originate? :)  I've done the same thing, actually.
Nice titles and all...

Tell Matt that he has an ally in the 'Net Freedom Fighters!  She's ALL fox
IMO. (I'm the only one & I'll be gone in 8 days, but I still exsist)

Apparently you've missed alot of the discussions on this topic...you might
want to download what you've missed from ftp.mv.com/pub/users/rat/sonic
& read the hundred or so posts on this subject.  I think any & all questions
you have come up with can be answered there.

Am I at college?

Well...it depends on what you call a college.  I go to a local community 
college because I'm just too lazy and too flat broke to go to big old ASU.

still...comm. college DOES get busy around finals.  Not that I NEED to 
cram...I'm a pretty smart guy.

Anyway, that's where I am...I don't post because I'm busy...It's just 
that I rarely have anything to say!

Not I, any more.  I escaped last year with a BSc. :-)

ObSonic:
I just picked up Princess Sally #3 and Sonic #24 today as my subscription copies
haven't arrived yet.  Now I can go read the summaries posted here last week.
In Sally #3, I got a big kick out of the "HANGER 18" sign (not "hangar"; maybe
it's a pun on the hanging sign itself), especially considering the type of 
vehicles found there.  And I was thrilled by the twist at the end of the story!
I also noticed that Sonic #24 is printed on a different kind of paper, and the
note in the masthead about using recycled paper was gone.

Tell your friend to read the relevant FAQ (and I thought I knew what a
FAQ was until I started keeping the file!).  Apparently your roomie
wasn't part of the discussion on trans-species mating that happened here
some time back.  Evidence: the flashforward at the end of "Sally's Crusade"
(In Your Face #1) as well as the beginning of "The Return" (Sonic #21).
This sort of thing never came up on television because you know how the
watchdogs in Broadcast Standards & Practices can be.  ;-)  Bottom line:
it's possible the King's mate wasn't a fox and that Sally takes after
her mother ([shameless plug] about whom, see my fanfic, "Bloodlines").
Between the comics and Teitelbaum, Sally is definitely identified as a
chipmunk/ground squirrel--hence, the absence of a major tail.  Needless
to say, I concur about Antoine being any kind of a "donor" to Tails --
it's just ridiculous.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Did I miss something?  I don't remember seeing any reviews of #24, and was 
thinking of posting one this week...  I also don't think it's in the latest 
FAQ...

>I also noticed that Sonic #24 is printed on a different kind of paper,

I never noticed any notes about recyled paper before.  To go somewhat 
off-topic, I see the Star Trek comics are now using some slick paper.  
Frankly, I kind of liked the old "newsprint" stuff - sure it didn't last 
that well, but I don't know that the stories are _that_ special, nor is it 
worth the bigger $ they end up charging...

That might be OK, depending on what they do with him...

I'm staying out of this one :^)

The Void was on last Saturday and I decided to watch it again (I was 
feeling masochistic, I guess...).  Sally's father's tail definitely came 
and went - now you saw it, now you didn't...

>    By the way.. the concept of Antoine 'giving' his tail to Tails is

If the unknown furry seen in the opening credits is Tails (note that this 
doesn't fit in with the continuity of Blast to the Past), then one 
possibility is that the pollution introduced by Robotnik caused a mutation 
in him _after_ he was born.

Quoth the Ratman:

>

What gave it away, the ".edu" in my address?

Very much so.  In fact, I work in the library at my old college (Andrews
University, Berrien Springs, MI) from whence I graduated with a BA in
theology in '74.  I also have a Master's in library science, and by
virtue of that I'm considered to be on the faculty here -- 
the professional librarians here have faculty rank even
though we're not necessarily teaching faculty.  One of the perks is that
faculty can take up to 5 credits in coursework per quarter and not pay
tuition.  So I'm slowly wending my way towards a Master's in Jewish
studies at the seminary on campus.  This quarter I'm slogging through
Aramaic (it's a Biblical language related to Hebrew).  So I'm not just
"at college": I work at one (specifically as the editor of a periodical
index) and I take a course on the side.

At the ripe old age of 43, I'd guess I'm one of the senior members of
the list.  I know you didn't ask but I didn't want to sound like an
overachiever =).

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Not me anymore.  I got a BS degree in audio technology in 1991 at Middle 
Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro (~30mi SE of Nashville).

I've not done an actual count, but I think there are quite a few .edu 
addresses in the subscriber database.  That and .com are probably the 
most prevalent.

Okay, okay... I've had this e-mail sitting in my mailbox for quite some time 
now, so I'd better respond to it... Work has been keeping me busy lately.

[regarding the Sonic Bibles]

Ummm... I don't know.  The Style Guide is available through our licensing 
department, but it's not cheap (I've heard $100).  I suppose I could run it 
through a photocopier for you guys, but the licensing group wouldn't like 
that...

Well, I've been kinda busy lately... Sorry.  I'm trying to get Comix Zone (a 
new interactive comic book fighting game) released.

Now where did I put that info on Tails... I'm going to have to look for it. 
 Hopefully soon... Grrrr...  :)

>Got anything on Knuckles, pray tell?

Just artwork (one of the model sheet picts I scanned and put up on the FTP 
site) right now.  Hopefully they'll write something up soon... Same with 
Sally---just artwork.

OH!  BTW, guys.. I bought a SLEW of these for RooCon3
(a small furry gathering locally) and thught mebbe the rest of ya
should know about 'em:
 
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG BUBBLE GUM (in a small Game Gear shaped container)

The packaging on this is VERY much like a miniature game gear (cross-
pad on the left, two buttons on right and START button above those
two).  Inside, it contains FIVE large (2.5" x 1.5") rectangle soft
bubblegum pieces and FIVE Sonic Game Gear game trading cards.  They
seem to go for $0.99 everywhere I've bought them.

I have to agree here, I never did care for Sonic's personality. He's the 
'Star' or 'Hero' in name only. What does he have going for him? Just 
Speed and a lot of luck. Sally has all the leadership skills and the 
brains (for plot reasons the TV show would give Sonic brief flashes of 
insight, but they never really 'fit' Sonic)

What the problem is, Sonic's is too limited by the 'personality' that 
SEGA created for the video game. Fast, blue, who 'stretched' his 
personality by tapping his shoe waiting for the player to get back from 
the bathroom! (that by the way was the big breakthrough that made Sonic 
more of a personality than his true arch enemy..Mario!)

Now Sally and St. John are more interesting because they were created for 
'plot' not game play. Even Tails is more interesting because he was more 
flexable (his traits from Sonic 2 being more 'amiable' and flexable, of
course Tails could never become the 'classic' hero, at least without a lot 
of growing up, but he can fit into a number of sidekick roles)

Also Sally and St. John both LOOK a lot cuter than Sonic, fur is so 
much nicer than 'glumby cartoon quills' ...Way past! :-)

Following up the same way, since I havwe been involved here... :)

There are about half-a-dozen to a dozen species of ground squirrels, most 
of which *do not* have prominent tails. Some of them have only stubs for 
tails, hence it's mistaken to think chipmunks are in the squirrel family, 
even though they're similar. My reference is an Audubon (sp?) Society 
guide to NA mammals....

Sonic is a misunderstood character, but oddly enough, there isn't much 
known WRT the relationship between St.John and Sally, ie: *how* they fell 
in love-- The comic only gives that hint right at the end with the kiss 
and the diary note... And that's it.

....Quozl!

This is something I've had to face in developing my own fanfic (I've got
a couple-three more stories in development).  Sonic's been tough to
write for, since it's hard to get past the argot and the attitude.
Tough, but not impossible.  Hope the results speak for themselves one of
these days.  In one story (possible hint of a spoiler here) he runs into
an old friend from pre-Robotnik days, and events test that friendship.
But I'll say no more.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

This question pertains to Archie Comics Sonic issue #24 and would be 
considered to contain a spoiler if you want to know nothing at all about 
the story before reading the comic yourself.  My copy finally arrived today.

Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by "Sally" in the 
beginning of the story?

Here's a form feed for extra protection :^)

>Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by "Sally" in the 
>beginning of the story?

No, but she is kind of cute (no Buttermilk Slappy though...)

This gives me an excuse to offer my review of this issue:

When Hedgehogs Collide!

written by Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders
Pencils by Dave Manak (Chapters 1 and 2) and Art  Mawhinney (Chapters 3 and 4)
Inks by Harvo (??)    (Chapters 1 and 2) and Rich Koslowski (Chapters 3 and 4)

The story opens with Sonic, Sally, Antoine, and Tails all mistreating 
various members of Knothole (which is somewhat oddly shown as kind of a 
medieval village - various vendors selling stuff in the "town square", etc.
Also, Antoine's mischief involves a sports car - since when does anybody 
run around in motorized vehicles?)

Chapter 2 reveals that these 4 are really the evil imposters from the 
alternate universe seen previously in issues 11 and 19.  Apparently 
Robotnik is a "kindly ol'... grade-A wimp!", and the SWATbots do all the 
work, so life is boring (at least for bad guys like these).  So they 
decided for kicks to come to "our dimension" (rather handy how they can hop 
on the "cosmic interstate" whenever they want) and make trouble for our 
heroes.  Drooling fanboys should note that this chapter has a few shots of 
the evil Sally in leather...  Also, that Tails and Rotor have facial 
stubble; I didn't know furries could do that :^)

Chapter 3 begins with a major continuity glitch as Sonic, Tails, and 
Antoine come through Rotor's "Timespace Matter Projector" (TM) back from 
"negative reality", but couldn't "pierce the ZONE OF SILENCE where Robotnik 
exiled Sally's dad KING ACORN!"  ????  Nice exchange between Sonic and 
Nicole here...

Sally almost catches them talking about their attempt, and there's a brief 
reference to the Princess Sally Miniseries story.  However, before either 
can talk about (or evade :^)) these topics, the angry villagers attack them 
thinking they're the bad guys.  Our heroes escape to figure out what to do...
(Note: Tails flies off with Antoine, Sally hitches a ride with Sonic, and 
Rotor flies off with a jetpack.)

The "Sonic art" pinup is nothing special.

Part 4 has the imposters attack again, but this time wearing their 
"leathers"; the villagers _still_ don't get it...  The first panel shows 
a rabbit mother and her son running away from them.  This is as good a 
place as any to note that Bunnie doesn't appear in this issue :^(  

The imposters decide to attack a band of "poor innocent gypsies" who, 
natch, are our heroes in disguise.  We get to see how handy Sally is with a 
bow and arrow, then your basic fight scene as everybody goes hand-to-hand
(paw-to-paw?) with their counterparts.  However, they are too evenly 
matched, so Sally yells "Change partners!" and this does the job.

The story ends with our Sonic telling evil Sonic "game over - you lose!" 
and he gets the reply: "Shows how much YOU know, pretty boy!  I got what I 
came for!  A fight!"  and then he faints.  Sally asks Sonic how he can live 
with himself, and he replies "Confidentially, Princess, it ain't easy!"

The announcements section on the letters page has a plug for the Sonic & 
Knuckles comic, plus the fact that the 25th issue will be an adaptation of 
the CD Game featuring Mecha Sonic!!  Covers for both are shown; with I was 
more enthused about either...

Nothing special in the fan letters, but the reply to one notes that the 
Tails mini-series will be on sale next fall.  (Do they mean _this_ fall?)
(actually, it was probably _last_ fall when they wrote that, so this fall 
was really last fall's next fall - have I lost everybody yet?  :^)
There was a nice exchange between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck along that line 
one time - I wish I had a transcription of it.)

That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...

Cute, yes, but a bit on the young side for me- I think she's about 12 here..

In general, not very well drawn in alot of spots, though there were some 
good points, though... Writing could've been better, too. Nowhere *near* 
the calibre of work put into the Princess Sally miniseries, 
unfortunately! :(

I was rather bothered by these two factors, myself, considering (a) 
they're in our future, and (b) Knothole has always been, in the DiC 
cartoons (my exposure, natch), to be a makeshift rebel compound, and not 
a self-contained community.... Considering Archie is taking up the reigns 
in presenting the Sonic universe after the cancellation of the DiC 
cartoons, and the big draw is *coming* from the DiC SatAM audience, it's 
disconcerting at best....

Chapter 2 was an overall improvement after Ch. 1- In the beginning, at 
least. There *are* certain .fandom-esque notes to be made here, 
particularly of Sally (as mentioned) and of course, Sonic's desk! Turning 
the scene upside-down and read from left to right we have:

     Sonic      Sonic      Sonic      Sonic
       +          +          +          +
     Sally      Bunnie     Nicole     Sonic

The first, obviously was no surprise and the second caught me off-guard, 
not expecting seeing something I suspected being confirmed (yeah, I know; 
alternate world, but there are parallels between the two Sonics, 
including interests and egos!); however, I was *totally* surprised by the 
latter two, and had me ROTFLing! :) (But then again, Sonic *does* love 
himself!- It's Nicole that caught me off-guard here! :) )

This chapter had some considerable improvement overall, notably in the 
art, notably in this splash page... And yes, Bunnie is conspicuous by her 
absense in this comic. I think it's probably because the issue is a 
regression to the style of the *syndicated* DiC cartoon, which the comic 
series was initially based on..

Third .fandom-esque note: Sally *in* a skirt- Then she takes the skirt off!

The fight was so-so; the ending was a typical Sonic statement, though it 
would've been something he would've been more upbeat about...

Frankly, I didn't care much for the story. OK, I've been spoiled rotten 
by the SatAM DiC cartoon, and the Princess Sally miniseries, and most of 
the fanfic written *so far* has been better than *this*.... Come on, 
fellas! I'd rather have the quality of the Princess Sally miniseries over 
*this!* :(

Not me anymore.  I got a BS degree in audio technology in 1991 at Middle

I've not done an actual count, but I think there are quite a few .edu 
addresses in the subscriber database.  That and .com are probably the

Ummm... I don't know.  The Style Guide is available through our licensing

Except I remember seeing a Discovery Channel documentary or something on

there's variation in ground squirrels or some junk...

I have to agree here, I never did care for Sonic's personality. He's the 
'Star' or 'Hero' in name only. What does he have going for him? Just 
Speed and a lot of luck. Sally has all the leadership skills and the 
brains (for plot reasons the TV show would give Sonic brief flashes of 
insight, but they never really 'fit' Sonic)

What the problem is, Sonic's is too limited by the 'personality' that 
SEGA created for the video game. Fast, blue, who 'stretched' his 
personality by tapping his shoe waiting for the player to get back from 
the bathroom! (that by the way was the big breakthrough that made Sonic 
more of a personality than his true arch enemy..Mario!)

Now Sally and St. John are more interesting because they were created for 
'plot' not game play. Even Tails is more interesting because he was more 
flexable (his traits from Sonic 2 being more 'amiable' and flexable, of
course Tails could never become the 'classic' hero, at least without a lot 
of growing up, but he can fit into a number of sidekick roles)

Also Sally and St. John both LOOK a lot cuter than Sonic, fur is so 
much nicer than 'glumby cartoon quills' ...Way past! :-)

There are about half-a-dozen to a dozen species of ground squirrels, most 
of which *do not* have prominent tails. Some of them have only stubs for 
tails, hence it's mistaken to think chipmunks are in the squirrel family, 
even though they're similar. My reference is an Audubon (sp?) Society 
guide to NA mammals....

Sonic is a misunderstood character, but oddly enough, there isn't much 
known WRT the relationship between St.John and Sally, ie: *how* they fell 
in love-- The comic only gives that hint right at the end with the kiss 
and the diary note... And that's it.

This is something I've had to face in developing my own fanfic (I've got
a couple-three more stories in development).  Sonic's been tough to
write for, since it's hard to get past the argot and the attitude.
Tough, but not impossible.  Hope the results speak for themselves one of
these days.  In one story (possible hint of a spoiler here) he runs into
an old friend from pre-Robotnik days, and events test that friendship.
But I'll say no more.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

This question pertains to Archie Comics Sonic issue #24 and would be 
considered to contain a spoiler if you want to know nothing at all about 
the story before reading the comic yourself.  My copy finally arrived today.

Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by "Sally" in the

>Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by "Sally" in the 
>beginning of the story?

No, but she is kind of cute (no Buttermilk Slappy though...)

This gives me an excuse to offer my review of this issue:

When Hedgehogs Collide!

written by Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders
Pencils by Dave Manak (Chapters 1 and 2) and Art  Mawhinney (Chapters 3 and 4)
Inks by Harvo (??)    (Chapters 1 and 2) and Rich Koslowski (Chapters 3 and 4)

The story opens with Sonic, Sally, Antoine, and Tails all mistreating 
various members of Knothole (which is somewhat oddly shown as kind of a 
medieval village - various vendors selling stuff in the "town square", etc.
Also, Antoine's mischief involves a sports car - since when does anybody 
run around in motorized vehicles?)

Chapter 2 reveals that these 4 are really the evil imposters from the 
alternate universe seen previously in issues 11 and 19.  Apparently 
Robotnik is a "kindly ol'... grade-A wimp!", and the SWATbots do all the 
work, so life is boring (at least for bad guys like these).  So they 
decided for kicks to come to "our dimension" (rather handy how they can hop 
on the "cosmic interstate" whenever they want) and make trouble for our 
heroes.  Drooling fanboys should note that this chapter has a few shots of 
the evil Sally in leather...  Also, that Tails and Rotor have facial 
stubble; I didn't know furries could do that :^)

Chapter 3 begins with a major continuity glitch as Sonic, Tails, and 
Antoine come through Rotor's "Timespace Matter Projector" (TM) back from 
"negative reality", but couldn't "pierce the ZONE OF SILENCE where Robotnik 
exiled Sally's dad KING ACORN!"  ????  Nice exchange between Sonic and 
Nicole here...

Sally almost catches them talking about their attempt, and there's a brief 
reference to the Princess Sally Miniseries story.  However, before either 
can talk about (or evade :^)) these topics, the angry villagers attack them 
thinking they're the bad guys.  Our heroes escape to figure out what to do...
(Note: Tails flies off with Antoine, Sally hitches a ride with Sonic, and 
Rotor flies off with a jetpack.)

The "Sonic art" pinup is nothing special.

Part 4 has the imposters attack again, but this time wearing their 
"leathers"; the villagers _still_ don't get it...  The first panel shows 
a rabbit mother and her son running away from them.  This is as good a 
place as any to note that Bunnie doesn't appear in this issue :^(  

The imposters decide to attack a band of "poor innocent gypsies" who, 
natch, are our heroes in disguise.  We get to see how handy Sally is with a 
bow and arrow, then your basic fight scene as everybody goes hand-to-hand
(paw-to-paw?) with their counterparts.  However, they are too evenly 
matched, so Sally yells "Change partners!" and this does the job.

The story ends with our Sonic telling evil Sonic "game over - you lose!" 
and he gets the reply: "Shows how much YOU know, pretty boy!  I got what I 
came for!  A fight!"  and then he faints.  Sally asks Sonic how he can live 
with himself, and he replies "Confidentially, Princess, it ain't easy!"

The announcements section on the letters page has a plug for the Sonic & 
Knuckles comic, plus the fact that the 25th issue will be an adaptation of 
the CD Game featuring Mecha Sonic!!  Covers for both are shown; with I was 
more enthused about either...

Nothing special in the fan letters, but the reply to one notes that the 
Tails mini-series will be on sale next fall.  (Do they mean _this_ fall?)
(actually, it was probably _last_ fall when they wrote that, so this fall 
was really last fall's next fall - have I lost everybody yet?  :^)
There was a nice exchange between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck along that line 
one time - I wish I had a transcription of it.)

That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...

Cute, yes, but a bit on the young side for me- I think she's about 12 here..

In general, not very well drawn in alot of spots, though there were some 
good points, though... Writing could've been better, too. Nowhere *near* 
the calibre of work put into the Princess Sally miniseries, 
unfortunately! :(

I was rather bothered by these two factors, myself, considering (a) 
they're in our future, and (b) Knothole has always been, in the DiC 
cartoons (my exposure, natch), to be a makeshift rebel compound, and not 
a self-contained community.... Considering Archie is taking up the reigns 
in presenting the Sonic universe after the cancellation of the DiC 
cartoons, and the big draw is *coming* from the DiC SatAM audience, it's 
disconcerting at best....

Chapter 2 was an overall improvement after Ch. 1- In the beginning, at 
least. There *are* certain .fandom-esque notes to be made here, 
particularly of Sally (as mentioned) and of course, Sonic's desk! Turning 
the scene upside-down and read from left to right we have:

     Sonic      Sonic      Sonic      Sonic
       +          +          +          +
     Sally      Bunnie     Nicole     Sonic

The first, obviously was no surprise and the second caught me off-guard, 
not expecting seeing something I suspected being confirmed (yeah, I know; 
alternate world, but there are parallels between the two Sonics, 
including interests and egos!); however, I was *totally* surprised by the 
latter two, and had me ROTFLing! :) (But then again, Sonic *does* love 
himself!- It's Nicole that caught me off-guard here! :) )

Mediocre chapter here.....

Agreed.....

This chapter had some considerable improvement overall, notably in the 
art, notably in this splash page... And yes, Bunnie is conspicuous by her 
absense in this comic. I think it's probably because the issue is a 
regression to the style of the *syndicated* DiC cartoon, which the comic 
series was initially based on..

Third .fandom-esque note: Sally *in* a skirt- Then she takes the skirt off!

The fight was so-so; the ending was a typical Sonic statement, though it 
would've been something he would've been more upbeat about...

Frankly, I didn't care much for the story. OK, I've been spoiled rotten 
by the SatAM DiC cartoon, and the Princess Sally miniseries, and most of 
the fanfic written *so far* has been better than *this*.... Come on, 
fellas! I'd rather have the quality of the Princess Sally miniseries over 
*this!* :(

Same here....

"Ah-hah! Pronoun trouble!" :)

> That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...

That's okay- I just went through 1-1/2 Art Of Noice CDs typing this 
reply.... That's an hour, mind you..... (OK, so I'm slow... Nothing new 
about *that*....)

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]


#24  [Jul 1995]
"When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski
(Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the

Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!


Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: The following represents the positions of neither ABC, Sega
nor DiC, but rather is a recap of scuttlebutt on the Sonic e-mail
group: DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics

mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic

mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic

fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails

On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.



#24  [Jul 1995]
"When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski
(Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.




Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
above), which conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the
rest of the second season.

To tell the truth, I'm _not_. But I have to admit that the american  
concept of college sounds pretty cool... free internet access and lots
of time to send e-mail or play MUCK games over the net <smirk>.

As for myself, I'm working for the 'German Inland Revenue Office'  
(translation from my new-bought dictionary). It's not the funniest
thing to do, but it's a living... only problem is that my job has  
absolutely nothing to do with computers <sigh>.

Actually, it's still broken. I'll letcha know when it's fixed, and it's safe
to subscribe to the digested list. You see, that should have gone to the
digest, not the main list. :-(

See the Sonic FAQ File for a brief synopsis.  I'm not sure when it will
run again.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

Mobian taxonomy must be different.  

Robuttnik refers to Sonic as a "rodent" fairly often, but 
(on Earth at least) hedgehogs are insectovores, not rodents.
Maybe he means that Sonic gnaws at him in a more metaphorical way.
Maybe he really is referring to Sally, since squirrels _are_ rodents.
Or maybe saying "insectovore" would just confuse half the audience,
and disgust the rest.

And in "Tails' Tallest Tale" (in Sonic In Your Face), one of the
characters thinks that Knuckles is a "misunderstood marsupial".
Again, echidnas are monotremes, not marsupials.  But I have to
admit, "marsupial" sounds way more cool than "monotreme".

Robuttnik is an enemy, so he's probably teasing him. Like calling a Korean
person "Chinaman". 

But good observation.

a couple of weeks and I was wondering if this were just slow, or if I 
somehow got knocked off of the list.  Has it been slow?

As stated in an earlier post, I've got a couple stories "in development"
but haven't had the chance to work on them except in my head.

I've also taken a recent thread to heart and deleted the line "We now
return you to your regularly scheduled rodent" from my sig.  Kinda liked
the alliteration, though.

Greetings.

This past weekend I found myself answering a question I had asked in the
course of reviewing Sonic #24: Would Bunnie in the world of the
Antisonic be partially roboticized?  The answer I arrived at led
me to begin imagining how that could be part of a larger story plot.

After enough thinking along these lines another question came to me:
"How are the comics written in the first place?"  I know I can always
drop some snail mail to Mark Fulop asking for any "Guidelines for
Writers" that might exist -- if they work with freelancers at all!  How
about it?  Anyone out there know if they look into freelance
submissions, or do they only rely on a stable of regulars?

(nods)  I know the feeling... I've got two stories buzzing around in my 
head: a dark future story starring Sonic and Metalsonic, and a solo Tails 
story.  Still haven't got anything on paper yet (I've tried, but haven't 
been able to get quite the right 'feel'...)

What's wrong with 'regularly scheduled hedgehog'?  (:3

Until I get my act together, you'll just have to deal with the real me.

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest@lists.mv.net)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  You may change your subscription
status from "live" to digest or from digest to "live" at any time.
If you do decide to change your subscription status, be sure you
unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore, or you will
be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages twice.
See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net if
you subscribe to the "live" version or to sonic-digest@lists.mv.net
if you subscribe to the digest version.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read
them before posting to the list.  They can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as faq-dd and faq-jf.  See "How to
Retrieve Files" below.

The lists are archived, and the archive can be retrieved through
the mailing list software as a file, just like the FAQ's.  The
filename to request is mail.txt.  Older monthly archives and some
other Sonic-related files can be retrieved too.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters
and stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  You may post messages on the Sonic games to
the extent that the focus is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or
characters, and not on the games themselves.  Asking why Knuckles
rarely appears in the comics is on-topic, but asking how to become
"Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.

If you feel you must flame someone (other than Robotnik (g) ), please
do so in mail directly to that person.  And as on most areas of the
'net, legally obscene material and posts of a commercial nature are not
welcome here.  

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

How To Retrieve Files
=====================
To get a list of files you can retrieve, send this text to
majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    index sonic
    end
Once you have the filename of the file(s) you want, retrieve them
by sending this text to majordomo@lists.mv.net:
    get sonic file1.txt
    get sonic file2.txt
    end
Use one "get" line for each file you want.

How To Change Your Status

    Try looking up the word "hedgehog" and a *few* Sonic files
    should turn up.  Most of what you'll find will not be at all
    related to Sonic.
WWW
    Sega has a home page (http://www.segaoa.com/), but you won't
    find much information there (but do have your credit card
    ready (g)).  Another home page where you can find Sonic images
    is http://www.ysu.edu/~ptighe/sonic.html.

Juice time, outta here!

sroyals for each of the dark Wizard's toys wrecked.  You've made a
pretty penny today, Son-ak, and I merely thought you'd like to
collect it."
     "Your mistress.  And who is that?  For that, who are you?"
     "I," replied the rabbit, "Am Captain Bunnie,  in service to
her Highness, the Princess Salar-Alicia of House Acorn, and leader
of her Royal Guards.  And I already... ah... 'heard' of you,
hedgehog.  You want your fifteen royals or not?"
     Son-ak grinned.  After weeks of boredom, things were looking
up.  A good fight, gold to refill his almost empty purse, and he'd
met a female of both obvious bravery and courage-- and, not that he
allowed himself to notice, beauty as well.  Yes, perhaps his
fortunes were changing for the better...

     To the east, a massive form shuddered.  A hand clutched a
glittering stone, and a quiet snarl escaped thick lips.
     "Sniv.  To me.  Now."
     The shadows produced a short, black swathed figure.  "My
lord?"
     "Something in the west has destroyed three of my iron golems
in as many moments.  And when I am about to begin my true plans,
that is an ill matter.  Ill indeed...You are my master spy, Sniv
the Quiet.  Go forth, go and learn what causes me such concern at
this time."
     "As you command, Master."  The figure melted back into the
shadows.
     And Roboth-amon, the Dark Wizard of the East, mused on the
possibility-- for the first time-- that his designs might be in
peril.

     to be continued...

     Other Sonics #1-- The Barbarian : Part One

     By Robert Haynie

     Obligatory stuff-- Sonic the Hedgehog, Bunnie Rabbot, etc. TM
and copyright 1995 by Sega of America and Archie Comics.  They
probably reserve all rights.  This story is copyright 1995 Robert
S. Haynie Jr.  This is an excercise in fan fiction, and is not
meant to infringe on their rights, but is a purely recreational
exercise.  It may be duplicated freely, with the restrictions that
A) no text is changed, and B) no money is charged.

     Foreword:

     In more than one issue of the STH comic the so-called "Cosmic
Interstate" has been mentioned.  Most noted was issue #19 (I
believe), "Night of a Thousand Sonics", which noted that there were
(in theory) many, many versions of the hedgehog.  But what are
these other realms like?  What are the others like in them?  Is
Bunnie always such a babe in them (Sorry, that just slipped out)?
Let us look at one...  Offramp #14-a-347-bx-2, Mobs in the age of
high fantasy...

     Prologue

     "Know, oh Prince. that in the age of the House of Acorn, when
a darkness rose from the bitter East to cleave the Kingdom and to
bring strife and misery to the children of Karuis, there came Son-
Ak, a thief, a reaver, a runner, who had sought only adventure but
found himself n the path of heroes, who won a crown and a bride by
the strength of his good right arm and the swiftness of his feet.
Or something like that.  I really don't remember, I haven't had
enough sleep."
          The chronicles of Mandar the Insomniac

     It was mostly rain that day, rain and mud, and the lost
warrior trudged through the thick gruel that water and dust had
made of the road with an expression of bitter annoyance and a heart
filled with growing mayhem.  In time, he came to a roadside tavern,
and entered with considerable depression.
     A barmaid took a single look at him and quailed.
Understandably, for the warrior was an intimidating sort.  Tall for
a hedgehog-- over three feet, in fact-- clad in a hide tunic and
boots, and carrying a large battleaxe on his back,  he had the
still visible marks of battle scars under his frontal fur.  His
quills were longer and sharper than the usual for his kind, and
were styled in an intimidating blade-like fashion,  and were of
the blue color peculiar to the barbarian tribes of the northlands.
     The warrior took a seat at an unoccupied table, and the
barmaid, urged on by the tavern keeper, approached uncertainly.
Her life wasn't the easiest, and she feared that the fearsome
stranger would grab at her, or yell, or something frightening.  But
he merely growled for ale and food, tossing a few copper coins
down-- enough to pay for his desires.  And sulked.
     "Man, I HATE rain."
     After a few moment, the barmaid bought a plate of sausages and
cheese, some bread, and a pitcher of ale to the table.  She began
to leave, when the hedgehog began to do something odd.  First he
cut two slender pieces of bread from the loaf, then placed a
sausage on one, scraped off bits of cheese onto it, sighed, and
covered the whole with the other slice of bread.  "Wish I had some
stew for this,"  he mumbled quietly.  "Always goes better with some
stew."
     The stranger ate in silence then, silence unbroken except for
the sipping of ale and the occasional unquiet burp.
     "He's... not very polite," whispered the barmaid to the
innkeeper.
     "Look at his dress, lass.  He's a barbarian, a northern
warrior.  You think he's used to doilies and fingerbowls?"
     "As though you had any," sniffed the barmaid, and returned to
the other customers.
     The hedgehog finished his meal in (relative) silence, and paid
for a room in back.  He entered, still silent, still sulking.  And
fell into a fitful sleep...

     speed... the speed of the Chosen... blue wind and golden
fire...

     The noise of the barmaid's screams broke the hedgehog's
unpleasant dream.  With long-practiced reflexes he leapt to his
feet, grabbed his axe, and cast open his door.  He didn't really
expect anything-- perhaps some patron who had drank too much and
could not handle it too well had got too "friendly", at worst some
bandits of some sort-- whatever, it would hardly be any--
     For a second, the warrior thought they were soldiers of some
sort, in strange armor.  But the movements were wrong, there were
no joints.  The barbarian realized that they were statues of some
dark metal, bought to life by some hellish spell.
     For the first time in weeks, Son-ak the Blue grinned.
     Almost casually he began to whirl his battleaxe in a circle,
but rather than the usual two or three swings most would have used,
(to intimidate)  Son-ak continued to spin the blade, faster and
faster, until it was a silvery circle above his head.  And then,
with a blood-chilling war cry, he charged the demon-statues.
     Where a common blade-stroke would have hardly bent the metal
of the enchanted figures, the whirling axe struck with such force
that the metal parted.  Green fire erupted from the cracked shell
of the statue, and the figure collapsed into shards of broken
metal.  The two remaining figures turned towards this unexpected
interruption.
     Son-ak suddenly threw his axe at one, and leapt at the second,
tucking into a rolling ball in mid-leap.  The axe cracked one
statue, and-- amazingly-- Son-ak opened the other with flailing
quills.  Both spat the same green flame, both crumbled into scraps
of metal.
     The innkeeper stared at the remains of the three figures, and
at the now wildly grinning hedgehog, who threw back his head and
howled a barbaric cry of defiance and victory.  Then he turned his
attentions to the barmaid, who had collapsed after she had
screamed.
     "Hah!  I'd thought that there wasn't anything to do here!  You
ought to have told me of such entertainment, innkeeper!"
     "Entertainment," spat the innkeeper.  "You may call it
entertainment, Barbarian, but no one here would.  We've had enough
grief from the Dark Wizard before.  Still, my thanks for stopping
those golems.  I've never seen such bladework before with an axe."
     "Aye," grinned the hedgehog,"And ye won't soon see it again!
I am Son-ak of the Cad-hai, the Swift one, the runner past the
wind, the Striker!  I run swifter than a thunderclap, strike harder
thana the lightning--"
     "And boast louder than a donkey," came a dry voice from
behind.
     "And boast louder than a donkey!  I-- Hey, wait a minute,"
sputtered Son-ak.  He turned about, to face the new speaker.
"That's hardly polite, bent-ear."
     "Spare me a barbarian's etiquette," replied the newcomer.
Son-ak frowned, even as he sized up the speaker.
     Most of the females he'd seen in his travels in the south had
been dressed either in simple tunics and dresses (if poor) or in
silks and gold (if wealthy, and rather skimpy if they had the looks
for it).  This one was garbed, instead, in a black leather halter
and trunks, with tall boots of the same material and plated
gauntlets.  The rabbit's ear was bent, at elast one was, but her
eyes were those of a warrior, and the large two-handed sword she
had cast on her back was not any city maiden's toy.  That she
could-- and did-- carry such a weapon meant she considered herself
a fighter.  The thin scar across her left eye (fortunate to have
missed the eye itself) meant she was.  And that no other scars were
visible meant she was a warrior of skill.
     "Captain Rabbot," blurted the innkeeper.  "You should have
seen him, he--"
     "I saw, innkeeper," she interrupted.  "You-- I think you'd
better come with me."
     Son-ak tightened his grip on his axe.  "If there's some idiot
law against aiding innkeepers here against demon-tricks--"
     The rabbit laughed.  "By Mosthe', no, swift one.  But anyone
who can fight like that-- and with such an unusual technique-- will
interest my mistress immensely.  Besides, there's a bounty of five
royals for each of the dark Wizard's toys wrecked.  You've made a
pretty penny today, Son-ak, and I merely thought you'd like to

ok, I can't hide it. This is a test message. I just needed an excuse

On with the Summary:

A while back I said I wasn't much of an art critic since I thought all the
artists did a fine job.. however I have to say I like the way Knuckles was 
drawn much better in "Panic in the Sky" over the other two stories.  I think
its in the way his eyes were drawn.

My comments are in {{ }}

-- Panic in the Sky! --
 [ Part 1 ]
The approach of a floating island disrupts the people on the western coast 
of the "Great Continent"*.  Back at Knothole, Sally and the crew hear of 
these reports and see the island is heading straight for Knothole**.  Sonic
walks in with Tails and tell the others its the Floating Island they were 
on a few months back*** where they met Knuckles the Echinda.

They head out in their TurboProp**** flown by Antoine to investigate the
island and why its come to Knothole.  On the way there they're nearly shot
down by guns mounted on the bottom.  The guns are avoided by flying above
the island's horison and Sonic parachutes (while Tails just flies) down to
land.

They see Brobdignagian*5* fungi [Giant Mushrooms] and have to avoid a few
hazards (pendulums and ax-weilding bots) but Sonic falls into a trap where
he once again sees Knuckles.

[Part 2]

Sonic is hanging onto the side of a cliff while Knuckles is about to step
on his fingers since this is Sonic's second trespassing offense.  Tails
saves the day (sorta) by trying to drop a rock on Knuckles from above.. this
sends both down the edge of the clif and nearly into dangerous waters.
Tails eventually airlifts both of them*6* to safety.  Knuckles grudgingly
thanks Tails and Sonic explains that the island's been 'hijacked'.

Knuckles takes Sonic and Tails down to the Chaos Chamber (where the Chaos
Emerald which holds up the island resides).  They see its energy is being
syphoned by none other than Robotnik himself!

Robotnik reveals his plan (since its too late to stop him*7*).  He burrowed
in from the underside of the island and added thrusters and weapons.  He'd
use it as a flying fortress and use energy from the Chaos Emerald to power 
weapons ment to wipe out the freedom fighters.

Knuckles, as guardian of the island can't allow his island to be used this
way and decides to smash the Chaos Emerald.  With the island falling 
Robotnik makes a hasty retreat... he thinks he still won since the island
is about to crush Knothole*8*.  Knuckles breaks out a spare*9* emerald and
replaces it in time.

Sonic asks Knuckles if he'd like to land the island and join the Freedom
Fighters.  Knuckles declines saying he has his own problems and responsi-
bilities and takes the island away so he can remove Robotnik's weapons.


{{
Lots of Footnotes:

* They give the impression Arlo, Penelope, Hamlin and Dylan (i.e. Freedom
  Fighters from Princess Sally Miniseries) live here.

** This is weird.  The freedom fighter's headquarters is looking alot like 
  Robotnik's place.. suprisingly high-tech for a rebel underground.

*** Sonic and Tails say they were on the island months ago... You mean after
  all this time they didn't tell anyone?

**** I've never been much on military markings but doesn't that plane have
  U.S. WWII markings.. maybe its their way of celebrating V.E day 50th aniv.

*5* What's "Brobdignagian" mean you ask?  Brobdignag?..  Jonathan Swift?.. 
  Gulliver's travels!?... READ A BOOK DAMMIT! -- READ A BOOK!

*6* He's lifting two guys bigger than he is?  Tails is going to need some
  BenGay for his rump after that one.

*7* That's what all evil villans say :)

*8* It looks like Robotnik knows where Knothole is... Also, there are alot
  of visible huts in what used to be an 'underground village'.

*9* Knuckles later says it wasn't a spare.. he swapped emeralds, broke a 
  'fake' one and replaced the real one.  There's really was no reason for 
  him to tell Sonic he had a 'spare' emerald since Robotnik had already 
  left...  He could've just told him he swapped emeralds right then and 
  there.  (Or he could've just stuck to his lie).
}}

-- Fire Drill --

Knuckles hears a loud 'KA-THOOOM!' from near the beach and he flies over to
investigate.  He spots the intruder in some bushes but its gone when he 
jumps it.  He suspects its Sonic since whoever it is MUST be very fast.

Knuckles follows the trail around to places on the island even HE doesn't 
know about (apparently his father never revealed ALL of the island's secrets).

The trail eventually leads off the edge of the island.  Knuckles still thinks
it was Sonic up to no good... "Good riddence (just wait'll next time)"

[ In the last panel we see that the invader is still on the island.  Only
the shadow of a hand is shown as he says to himself... "This was only your 
first lesson and I can see already you have a lot to learn!  Class is now 
in session..." ]

{{ I have no idea who this mysterious person is.. the arm looks too skinny
   to be Robotnik's though.  maybe a Chaotix character..  maybe Nack the 
   Weasel.  I can't say.
   I liked this story... it had a mysterious feel to it. }}


-- Lord of the Floating Island --

We see Knuckles patroling the floating island on an unusually windy day 
when he spots a confused baby kangaroo.  He lands to keep the joey company
while they search for mom.  Bengy (we find out his name later) knows 
Knuckles watches over the island and asks him to bring back the sky.
[Its unusually dark during the day.. yet there are few clouds].  Knukles 
explains that what's happening is an 'eclipse' and that's probably whats
causing the unusual winds. 

After avoiding a herd of (biped) dingoes Knuckles explains a bit more about
the island to Bengy... how its a paradise yet there's been visitors who'd
like to change that [namely Sonic and Robotnik].

As the eclipse ends and the winds die down they meet up with Bengy's mom.
Knuckles flies off..  "This is my island!  And I live to protect and serve!"

{{ There really wan't a whole lot too this story.  All it really shows
   is that Knuckles isn't really such a bad guy after all. }}

No SonicGrams but there's a few announcements:

Sonic Issue #25 (Aug. '95) will feature:
  Sonic vs. Mecha Sonic (From Sonic CD)  and  Silver Ink Cover {{ woowoo }}

Sonic the Hedgehog in Triple Trouble 48-page Special [on sale Aug. '95]
  Introducing "Nack the Weasel".  Featuring all-out brawl between
  Sonic-n-Knuckles, a Knuckles Solo Story, and a Tails Solo Story.

{{ My note:  Archie Comic's 'On Sale' dates tend to be faithful (or try to 
   be) but the dates put on the issues tend to be 'two months early' 
   [i.e. Sonic #24 is the July issue but came out in May]  I guess this
   gives them some 'breathing room' in case something crops up.. e.g the
   last minutes "Princess Sally Miniseries" changes }}

There are a lot of graduations going on today and tomorrow.  Any new 
grads (or about-to-be) on the list?

Did you all remember to invite Sonic to your graduation and end of school 
year parties? :-)

If you're taking summer classes or if you get use of your account during 
the summer anyway, don't forget to drop by your computer lab for the 
latest from Mobius!

I definitely can't have been the first to imagine there could be a
realm where HFF is the hero, and Sonic is all but the lowly
sidekick. :)

Or, at least, where Tails gets equal billing.  (:3

We've already seen a good Sonic and an evil Sonic.  The Sonic I want to 
see is halfway in-between; imagine a world where Robotnik's every bit as 
rotten as he is in the 'mainstream' universe, but where our favorite 
hedgehog fights him for pay, not ideals.  The rest of his crew would be 
similarly hard-bitten: Bunnie, Sonic's right-hand strong-arm with a yen 
for revenge; Tails, an accomplished sneak-thief and expert at disabling 
security; Rotor, the inventor of new and lethal weapons to aid their 
fight.  Sally and Antoine would probably be about the same, though 
there'd be little romance between Sally and Sonic; hiring a team of 
experienced terrorists is bound to drain the royal coffers...

It's not the fall that hurts.  It's the sudden stop at the end.

If your mail program supports playing a sound when new mail comes in, 
this is the sound for you!

This is a .WAV of Uncle Chuck's "warble" that he does when he's written a 
message for Sally and is about to have it flown to her.

The filename is chukcall.zip.

WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

Sonic & Knuckles special issue
[Summaries by James Firmiss]

--Panic in the Sky--
[Part 1]

The approach of a floating island disrupts the people on the western coast 
of the "Great Continent"*.  Back at Knothole, Sally and the crew hear of 
these reports and see the island is heading straight for Knothole**.  Sonic
walks in with Tails and tell the others its the Floating Island they were 
on a few months back*** where they met Knuckles the Echinda.

They head out in their TurboProp**** flown by Antoine to investigate the
island and why its come to Knothole.  On the way there they're nearly shot
down by guns mounted on the bottom.  The guns are avoided by flying above
the island's horison and Sonic parachutes (while Tails just flies) down to
land.

They see Brobdignagian*5* fungi [Giant Mushrooms] and have to avoid a few
hazards (pendulums and ax-weilding bots) but Sonic falls into a trap where
he once again sees Knuckles.

[Part 2]

Sonic is hanging onto the side of a cliff while Knuckles is about to step
on his fingers since this is Sonic's second trespassing offense.  Tails
saves the day (sorta) by trying to drop a rock on Knuckles from above.. this
sends both down the edge of the clif and nearly into dangerous waters.
Tails eventually airlifts both of them*6* to safety.  Knuckles grudgingly
thanks Tails and Sonic explains that the island's been 'hijacked'.

Knuckles takes Sonic and Tails down to the Chaos Chamber (where the Chaos
Emerald which holds up the island resides).  They see its energy is being
syphoned by none other than Robotnik himself!

Robotnik reveals his plan (since its too late to stop him*7*).  He burrowed
in from the underside of the island and added thrusters and weapons.  He'd
use it as a flying fortress and use energy from the Chaos Emerald to power
weapons ment to wipe out the freedom fighters.

Knuckles, as guardian of the island can't allow his island to be used this
way and decides to smash the Chaos Emerald.  With the island falling 
Robotnik makes a hasty retreat... he thinks he still won since the island
is about to crush Knothole*8*.  Knuckles breaks out a spare*9* emerald and
replaces it in time.

Sonic asks Knuckles if he'd like to land the island and join the Freedom
Fighters.  Knuckles declines saying he has his own problems and responsi-
bilities and takes the island away so he can remove Robotnik's weapons.


Lots of Footnotes:

* They give the impression Arlo, Penelope, Hamlin and Dylan (i.e. Freedom
  Fighters from Princess Sally Miniseries) live here.

** This is weird.  The freedom fighter's headquarters is looking alot like 
  Robotnik's place.. suprisingly high-tech for a rebel underground.

*** Sonic and Tails say they were on the island months ago... You mean after
  all this time they didn't tell anyone?

**** I've never been much on military markings but doesn't that plane have
  U.S. WWII markings.. maybe its their way of celebrating V.E day 50th aniv.

*5* What's "Brobdignagian" mean you ask?  Brobdignag?..  Jonathan Swift?.. 
  Gulliver's travels!?... READ A BOOK DAMMIT! -- READ A BOOK!

*6* He's lifting two guys bigger than he is?  Tails is going to need some
  BenGay for his rump after that one.

*7* That's what all evil villans say :)

*8* It looks like Robotnik knows where Knothole is... Also, there are alot
  of visible huts in what used to be an 'underground village'.

*9* Knuckles later says it wasn't a spare.. he swapped emeralds, broke a 
  'fake' one and replaced the real one.  There's really was no reason for 
  him to tell Sonic he had a 'spare' emerald since Robotnik had already 
  left...  He could've just told him he swapped emeralds right then and 
  there.  (Or he could've just stuck to his lie).


-- Fire Drill --

Knuckles hears a loud 'KA-THOOOM!' from near the beach and he flies over to
investigate.  He spots the intruder in some bushes but its gone when he 
jumps it.  He suspects its Sonic since whoever it is MUST be very fast.

Knuckles follows the trail around to places on the island even HE doesn't 
know about (apparently his father never revealed ALL of the island's secrets).

The trail eventually leads off the edge of the island.  Knuckles still thinks
it was Sonic up to no good... "Good riddence (just wait'll next time)"

[ In the last panel we see that the invader is still on the island.  Only
the shadow of a hand is shown as he says to himself... "This was only your 
first lesson and I can see already you have a lot to learn!  Class is now 
in session..." ]

{{ I have no idea who this mysterious person is.. the arm looks too skinny
   to be Robotnik's though.  maybe a Chaotix character..  maybe Nack the 
   Weasel.  I can't say.
   I liked this story... it had a mysterious feel to it. }}


-- Lord of the Floating Island --

We see Knuckles patroling the floating island on an unusually windy day 
when he spots a confused baby kangaroo.  He lands to keep the joey company
while they search for mom.  Bengy (we find out his name later) knows 
Knuckles watches over the island and asks him to bring back the sky.
[Its unusually dark during the day.. yet there are few clouds].  Knukles 
explains that what's happening is an 'eclipse' and that's probably whats
causing the unusual winds. 

After avoiding a herd of (biped) dingoes Knuckles explains a bit more about
the island to Bengy... how its a paradise yet there's been visitors who'd
like to change that [namely Sonic and Robotnik].

As the eclipse ends and the winds die down they meet up with Bengy's mom.
Knuckles flies off..  "This is my island!  And I live to protect and serve!"

{{ There really wan't a whole lot to this story.  All it really shows
   is that Knuckles isn't really such a bad guy after all. }}

I. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
Q5: "Sally Acorn?"
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!


Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: The following represents the positions of neither ABC, Sega
nor DiC, but rather is a recap of scuttlebutt on the Sonic e-mail
group: DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik

Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone

mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic

On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of

Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.



#24  [Jul 1995]
"When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski
(Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.




Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

On with the Summary:
--Panic in the Sky--
 [ Part 1 ]
The approach of a floating island disrupts the people on the western coast 
of the "Great Continent"*.  Back at Knothole, Sally and the crew hear of 
these reports and see the island is heading straight for Knothole**.  Sonic
walks in with Tails and tell the others its the Floating Island they were 
on a few months back*** where they met Knuckles the Echinda.

They head out in their TurboProp**** flown by Antoine to investigate the
island and why its come to Knothole.  On the way there they're nearly shot
down by guns mounted on the bottom.  The guns are avoided by flying above
the island's horison and Sonic parachutes (while Tails just flies) down to
land.

They see Brobdignagian*5* fungi [Giant Mushrooms] and have to avoid a few
hazards (pendulums and ax-weilding bots) but Sonic falls into a trap where
he once again sees Knuckles.

[Part 2]

Sonic is hanging onto the side of a cliff while Knuckles is about to step
on his fingers since this is Sonic's second trespassing offense.  Tails
saves the day (sorta) by trying to drop a rock on Knuckles from above.. this
sends both down the edge of the clif and nearly into dangerous waters.
Tails eventually airlifts both of them*6* to safety.  Knuckles grudgingly
thanks Tails and Sonic explains that the island's been 'hijacked'.

Knuckles takes Sonic and Tails down to the Chaos Chamber (where the Chaos
Emerald which holds up the island resides).  They see its energy is being
syphoned by none other than Robotnik himself!

Robotnik reveals his plan (since its too late to stop him*7*).  He burrowed
in from the underside of the island and added thrusters and weapons.  He'd
use it as a flying fortress and use energy from the Chaos Emerald to power 
weapons ment to wipe out the freedom fighters.

Knuckles, as guardian of the island can't allow his island to be used this
way and decides to smash the Chaos Emerald.  With the island falling 
Robotnik makes a hasty retreat... he thinks he still won since the island
is about to crush Knothole*8*.  Knuckles breaks out a spare*9* emerald and
replaces it in time.

Sonic asks Knuckles if he'd like to land the island and join the Freedom
Fighters.  Knuckles declines saying he has his own problems and responsi-
bilities and takes the island away so he can remove Robotnik's weapons.



Lots of Footnotes:

* They give the impression Arlo, Penelope, Hamlin and Dylan (i.e. Freedom
  Fighters from Princess Sally Miniseries) live here.

** This is weird.  The freedom fighter's headquarters is looking alot like 
  Robotnik's place.. suprisingly high-tech for a rebel underground.

*** Sonic and Tails say they were on the island months ago... You mean after
  all this time they didn't tell anyone?

**** I've never been much on military markings but doesn't that plane have
  U.S. WWII markings.. maybe its their way of celebrating V.E day 50th aniv.

*5* What's "Brombdignagian" mean you ask?  Brombdignag?..  Jonathan Swift?.. 
  Gulliver's travels!?... READ A BOOK!

*6* He's lifting two guys bigger than he is?  Tails is going to need some
  BenGay for his rump after that one.

*7* That's what all evil villans say :)

*8* It looks like Robotnik knows where Knothole is... Also, there are alot
  of visible huts in what used to be an 'underground village'.

*9* Knuckles later says it wasn't a spare.. he swapped emeralds, broke a 
  'fake' one and replaced the real one.  There's really was no reason for 
  him to tell Sonic he had a 'spare' emerald since Robotnik had already 
  left...  He could've just told him he swapped emeralds right then and 
  there.  (Or he could've just stuck to his lie).


-- Fire Drill --

Knuckles hears a loud 'KA-THOOOM!' from near the beach and he flies over to
investigate.  He spots the intruder in some bushes but its gone when he 
jumps it.  He suspects its Sonic since whoever it is MUST be very fast.

Knuckles follows the trail around to places on the island even HE doesn't 
know about (apparently his father never revealed ALL of the island's secrets).

The trail eventually leads off the edge of the island.  Knuckles still thinks
it was Sonic up to no good... "Good riddence (just wait'll next time)"

[ In the last panel we see that the invader is still on the island.  Only
the shadow of a hand is shown as he says to himself... "This was only your 
first lesson and I can see already you have a lot to learn!  Class is now 
in session..." ]

{{ I have no idea who this mysterious person is.. the arm looks too skinny
   to be Robotnik's though.  maybe a Chaotix character..  maybe Nack the 
   Weasel.  I can't say.
   I liked this story... it had a mysterious feel to it. }}


-- Lord of the Floating Island --

We see Knuckles patroling the floating island on an unusually windy day 
when he spots a confused baby kangaroo.  He lands to keep the joey company
while they search for mom.  Bengy (we find out his name later) knows 
Knuckles watches over the island and asks him to bring back the sky.
[Its unusually dark during the day.. yet there are few clouds].  Knuckles 
explains that what's happening is an 'eclipse' and that's probably what's
causing the unusual winds. 

After avoiding a herd of (biped) dingoes Knuckles explains a bit more about
the island to Bengy... how its a paradise yet there's been visitors who'd
like to change that [namely Sonic and Robotnik].

As the eclipse ends and the winds die down they meet up with Bengy's mom.
Knuckles flies off..  "This is my island!  And I live to protect and serve!"

{{ There really wan't a whole lot to this story.  All it really shows
   is that Knuckles isn't really such a bad guy after all. }}

--------------------

No SonicGrams but there's a few announcements:

Sonic Issue #25 (Aug. '95) will feature:
  Sonic vs. Mecha Sonic (From Sonic CD) and  Silver Ink Cover {{ woowoo }}

Sonic the Hedgehog in Triple Trouble 48-page Special [on sale Aug. '95]
  Introducing "Nack the Weasel".  Featuring all-out brawl between
  Sonic-n-Knuckles, a Knuckles Solo Story, and a Tails Solo Story.

32X - Knuckles Chaotix 48-page Special [on sale Nov. '95]

Knuckles Solo Stories in Sonic Issues #31-33 (Feb. '96 - Apr. '96)

Knuckles 3-part Miniseries beginning Jan. '96.

{{ My note:  Archie Comic's 'On Sale' dates tend to be faithful (or try to 
   be) but the dates put on the issues tend to be 'two months early' 
   [i.e. Sonic #24 is the July issue but came out in May]  I guess this
   gives them some 'breathing room' in case something crops up.. e.g the
   last minutes "Princess Sally Miniseries" changes }}


NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
above), which conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the
rest of the second season.

To all my friends on Sonic Net and FurToonia:

It's that time of year again, where we all go on our separate paths in life,
mine leads to Summer School down in UT-Brownsville.  I don't know if I
will have the time or the ability to get to the computer lab there to take care
of e-mail, or do some netsurfing (chew, I'm going to miss that), but I want 
all of you to know that I'm thinking about you.  As I wait for the summer to
end and the next semester here at UT to begin, I'll do what I can to keep
track of the Sonic Net via David's homepage (a.k.a. Bookshire).

In order to shorten the amount of time for sending this message, I have a
general address to everyone I can think of that needs notification:
-David, yes, still working on Part 2.  The end of the year hasn't exactly been
 very kind to story writers.  I still have your e-mail address, so I'll get
Part 2
 and 3 to you when I can for posting on Sonic Net, and the ENTIRE story 
 when it's completed.

NOTE:  Everyone addressed here after this point is via David Prower:

-(Bookshire):  I might have a few ideas later on how to improve my capabilities,
 I'll notify you when I can.
-Craig (Todd):  Hi, Dad.  Please keep the Chaos Emerald safe for me, and
 I'm sorry that I might not be active during the summer, because of what my 
 human has to do.  I hope you'll understand.  It pains me to do this, but now
 I'm infected with a RL virus, with no immediate cure but time.
-Dan (Sonic):  Hey, you past cool hedgehog!  I'll see you later when I can.
-Kris (Tolouse):  Don't forget to keep Antoine under control :)
-Alessandro (Tyro):  Good luck on those programs.
-(Tails:  list member's name unknown):  I'll miss you, big brother.
Hopefully, at
 a later time we can see each other again.  HFF forever!

(Revert to RL:)

This is my last message of the semester to the Sonic Net.  Keep the Sonic spirt 
alive, even though the show won't be (sob!)  I shall return...

I found a game that some of you might like.  I have uploaded it to the 
ftp site (ftp.mv.com) at /pub/users/rat/pc.  You must have a PC and at 
least EGA to play.

The game is called Animal Quest.  You choose which animal you want to be. 
Then you have to make it through to end of the forest while catching your
prey and avoiding those who would prey upon you.  Predators include your
natural enemies plus a man with a gun.  You can choose to be a fox (but
with only one tail), a wolf, a rabbit, a mouse, a porcupine (no
hedgehogs), a squirrel, and one or two others.  You also gain points for
eating fruits and plants your species naturally eats. 

I've never made it all the way across without getting caught several 
times.  For some reason, I seem to do better as a wolf than as a fox.

Requires EGA, VGA, or SVGA.  Fully OS/2 compatible and may be compatible 
with some versions of SoftPC.  You must register to get sound card 
support, mouse support, and additional animals (including deep sea and 
jungle species).  No joystick support at all.

I downloaded this game from Delphi about a week ago.  If you are on 
Delphi, you may find it faster to download the game from the PC SIG (GO 
MAIN COMP PC) than to ftp it.

This announcement is, at best, barely on-topic for this list, so please
send any replies directly to my address.  I will post a summary if there
are some particularly interesting comments.  I won't be doing 
announcements like this often, but I thought this game was worth a mention.

There are several new listings since v1.1.  I've added some toys that 
were reported to me, and a I added a sewing pattern I found in an ad for 
a local store.

I've also made some changes to try to improve readability.  All lines 
should now be <=79 characters.  And I've done some other touching-up.

I'm planning on a v2.0 with even more readability improvements.  I hope 
there will be some new and/or improved listings, but I will go ahead with 
v2.0 even without new information.

Contributions are always welcome.  You may post to the list or mail me 
directly.  When submitting a new listing, please try to include the 
manufacturer's name and address.  That might help someone get something 
not available in their area.

A while ago, someone raised the issue of Robotnik calling Sonic a rodent, 
which Sonic is not.

In my dictionary, a hedgehog is (incorrectly) defined as a porcupine  -- 
and porcupines *are* rodents.

Did anyone notice that Robotnik, in one of the Archie comics, says he had 
one of Sonic's quills?  But hedgehogs don't have porcupine quills.

Obviously, someone cut Biology class a few times too many (g).  Or maybe 
the whole thing is just misconception about what hedgehogs (and other 
animals) are.  For that matter, I know people who think rabbits are 
rodents, and they are not.  (Can you say Lagomorpha?  I knew you could.)

We know that Uncle Chuck had good reasons for inventing the device that 
Julian stole and made into the roboticizer.

But why was the Void invented?  I don't see how it would serve any useful 
purpose to the inhabitants of Mobius.

It also seems that the Void moves from one second-season episode to 
another.  Robotnik has some control over it, but how is he able to move 
it from where it was in "Game Guy" to where it was in "The Void"?

And what is it anyway?  The Void cannot be a black hole because it is 
escapable, life goes on within it, and it isn't black.  When Ari got 
sucked in, Sally called it a vortex (makes sense) and that someday they 
would figure it out (like the Void is a puzzle of some sort) and release 
him.  But Sally shouldn't have had any trouble realizing what Ari was 
going into because her father had already gone in years ago.  It doesn't 
seem that The Void changes so much, so often that it can't be recognized.

I think when the setting of fiction is another planet, you can do anything
you want. Let's say the species of hedgehog that can walk and talk (and eat
chili dogs) that live on Mobius have quills. 

Actually it's just the teeth that define a rodent. Rodent is from rodente
(spelling?) which means "to gnaw". So has anyone gotten a look at Sonic's
teeth?

>And what is it anyway?

   As far as I can tell, the Void is some type of gateway to someplace else.
 Maybe another dimension, maybe another planet, maybe sometime in future
Mobius.  I appear to think that I believe I heard that Naugus actually
invented it.  Robotnik just opened it for him to go in and never let him out.

>[NOP!]...how is he able to move it from where it was

   Well, there's a device that can open it and close it for him so all he has
to do is move the device.  (Depending on how big the thing is, this might be
a lot harder that it sounds.)
   So let's guess how big it is.  In "The Void," Naugus was the one who
opened it in the Great Unknown.  (And left an artifact for Sonic to find.)
 It opened waaaaay out in the middle of nowhere.  Later, when Sonic went to
rescue Sally and Bunnie, Robotnik closed the Void after Sonic jumped in.
 This means that this device that Robotnik uses to control the Void is very
portable and can fit in a hover unit.  Or extremely huge and sits in the
middle of Robotropolis where Robotnik can control the Void form the safety of
his command center.  I'd guess it to be big because Snively pushed a button
or does something on a consol in the command center to close the Void instead
of ordering one of the Swat-bots at the scene to do it for him.

Of the three, I think another dimension is best.  If it's future Mobius, 
then let's hope that Sally saw her father in the near future.  If in the 
Void, the year would be 4200, Sally won't be alive long enough to get him 
out of there permanently.  I, for one, wouldn't want to break that news 
to her.  Leaving the planet isn't too hard if you look at the Archie 
comic where everyone gets sucked up and placed in a tank for the giant's 
observation.  But then what planet is it?  We don't know much about 
Mobius's solar system.

I think you're right, that Naugus invented the Void.  But what did he 
want to accomplish by inventing it?  Or was he trying to invent something 
else and got the Void instead?  But if he did invent it, it shouldn't be 
so easy for Robotnik to keep him in.

I think it's of variable size.  When looking at the rest of the pinball 
machine, it looks like the Void can be fairly small and able to fit 
inside.  It looked much bigger in the Great Unknown.  Its size also seems 
to vary with its open/closing/closed status.

The file retrieval feature of the majordomo mailing list software has 
seen only sparse usage since the Sonic list's opening day in February.

Unless we get a lot of strong objections, the file retrieval function for 
the Sonic list will be closing.

"But what about the files?"
They will still be there.  You can retrieve them via ftp, which is what 
most of you have been doing anyway.

"But I don't have ftp!"
You can still use ftpmail.  I will post brief summaries on how to use 
ftpmail.

"But now I have to RTFM all over again!  And where is TnewFM?"
The new documentation will be out soon.  And it won't be hard to get used 
to the changes.

"Behind the scenes" changes will make it easier for me to maintain the
ftp'able file collection.  This will pay off for you in terms of it being 
easier for you to get up-to-date files.  The new ftp server is a little 
slower, but most of the files are not big enough for that to be a problem.

So let's get out there and knock some pods out of the sky!

 What I recall from "The Void" is Nagus's statement he discovered the Void,
but, he did later state that Robotnik invented the means to enter it. I
imagine that Doc R.'s motives for doing so were to have a handy place to
banish political prisoners without hope of rescue, such as Sally's father,
King Acorn.

>It also seems that the Void moves from one second-season episode to

 Since Sonic could leave the Void from any point within, I think it's logical
to assume that the Void could be entered from any point in Mobian
"normal-space." Robotnik could concevably position the equipment to open the
Void vortex anywhere.

>But Sally shouldn't have had any trouble realizing what Ari was

 In the 2-part episode "Blast to the Past," Robotnik cast King Acorn into the
Void, (I guess that the King's last words, "You'll pay for this, Julian!"
rang true in "Doomsday." Too bad we'll never know for sure.) but since Sally
was only 5 and was busy being protected by her future 15 year old self, I
don't think either of them found out what happened to their father until "The
Void."
 Although, I don't understand how the King could have been at Ironlock Prison
in the Great Swamp, where Sal and Sonic later find the evidence of his former
presence there. ("Sonic Boom") I assume he must've been there before the
coup, because I also assume from the events in "Blast..." that Robotnik
captured him immediately.

 If anyone does have theories on what the Void is, maybe a parallel reality
or a pocket universe, I would _LOVE_ to hear them.

What intrigues me about the Void is a small detail: Naugus referred to
it by another name: Sanctuary.  As much of a prison as it might be, it
appears to serve some purpose.  It doesn't help that Naugus' character
was somewhat ill-defined in his only appearance in the series.  His
grievance against Robotnik is clear enough, but is he evil or just
spiteful?  He also looks (you'll forgive me) thrown together on the
cheap: the lobster claw and single horn appear to be particularly
pointless.  Frankly, he looks more ridiculous than impressive, and
"impressive" is the effect you hope to achieve if you're a wizard.

I also feel that there's some tie-in between the preoccupation with
gemstones (from the Time Stones to the Chaos Emeralds) and the
crystalline appearance of the place.  Perhaps the Void is where the
various stones are "born" before being placed in the Mobian world.

I've been working on a story which will be an apocalypse: how things end
once and for all.  As a result, I've been trying to cobble together
Mobian mythology (with not much success from a systematic point of
view).  Still, the story would involve mythical elements involving the
Chaos Emeralds as well as the Master Emerald [which I call "The Blood
Stone" for reasons a little too gory to go into at the moment].  The
Void doesn't figure into the plot -- not yet, at any rate.  But going
back to the previous paragraph, perhaps the Void is where the fate of
Mobius was originally conceived until Robotnik's intervention.  Mobius,
then, would stand at the crossroads between three distinct futures:
continuation of life under Robotnik, a return to pre-Robotnik
conditions, and simply dissolving into Chaos and destruction.  The Void,
IMO, is neither a parallel universe nor an alternate reality: rather, it
plays an as yet undefined role in Mobian cosmology.

Sorry to sound so academic about it.

and was quite possibly used for holding many prisoners temporarily.  IN
fact, it's quite likely that Robotnik performed all of his Void
experements at Irongate, it being an out of the way place that was
easily secured.  While there, King Acorn managed to hide the few things
he could-- perhaps even escaped for a few moments, only to be
recaptured and exiled into the Void.  That work for anyone?

   (Got this new quoting feature.  But anyway...)  Anything works until
something is documented.  The last few mesages have been about different
theories about this Void.  Any of them could be true until someone writes a
story/comic/show/movie (?) about it.  By doing this, the author effectively
says, "This is true, this is what happened," and all other theories are wrong
and made null and void.

Hello fellow Sonic Mailing-Listers...

Since Archie decided to do a few things different this time I decided to 
try something different with the summary for Sonic Issue #25.

Oh.. by the way.. Anyone else notice what looks like a Super Nintendo in the 
pile of junk in the foreground of the Sonic & Knuckles 48-page special?

---

There's just one 4-part story in this 'silver' 25th issue titled
--[ Go Ahead... Mecha My Day! ]--

Script:  (the return of) Mike Gallagher   Penciling: Pat (Spaz) Spaziante   
Inking:  Harvey (Harvo) Mercadoocasio     Lettering: Mindy Eisman
Coloring: Barry Grossman                  Cover Coloring: Heroic Age
Editor: Scott Fulop                       Managing Editor: Victor Gorelick
Editor-In-Chief: Richard Goldwater

  This story is heavily based on the Sonic CD game.  Here the freedom fighters 
discover Ivo Robotnik's new "zone portal".. the "Collision Chaos Zone".  
  To lure Sonic in the zone Robotnik kidnap's Sonic's biggest fan... none 
other than that pink hedgehog, AMY ROSE.  Tails is sent to investigate the 
zone from the air and he too becomes Robotnik's captive. (tied back-to-back 
with Amy... Ouch! watch the spines!)
  That's when Sonic goes into action.  To rescue Amy and Tails, he must race 
through these new zones and challenge Robotnik's newest creation, the 
jet-powered Mecha-Sonic!

  Spaz has gone a bit.. well.. spaz in this issue.  The layout's a bit 
different and we're given lots of close-up face shots, silhouettes, (and 
lots of Robotnik's teeth).  Some of the poses and angles seem a bit awkward 
but overall I like this layout. 

[Product Placement watch:  Knuckles Chaotix, Sega Saturn (Virtua Fighters)]

  The credit page (last page) features a collage of characters... 
lets see if I can find em all... 
  Robotnik, Badniks and other Sonic Foes: Dr. Ivo Robotnik, Snively, Swatbots,
Roboticized Uncle Chuck, Roboticized Muttski, Dark Princess Sally, Grounder,
Caterkiller, Coconuts, Mecha-Sonic, Robo-Sonic, Dark Biker Rotor, Knuckles.
  Sonic and other Goodniks: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles 'Tails' Prower, Rotor,
Princess Sally, Sir Charles (Uncle Chuck), Muttski, Antoine D'Coolette,
King Acorn, Arlo, Penelope, Hamlin, Dylan, Bunny Rabbot, Geoffrey St. John,
and last but not least: Amy Rose.

  Special Features:
--[ ProArt ]--
  The staff at Archie Comics show off their own Sonic drawings.

--[ Sonic-Grams ]--
  No letters!!  The whole page is dedicated to announcements from and about
the Archie crew.  They again announce a few specials coming soon:
  "Sonic Triple Trouble" and "Knuckles Chaotix" 48-page specials.
  "Knuckles" and "Tails" mini-series (We're all waiting for that last one).

I like this theory, but I think that I see a potential hole. Robotnik's Void
portal room, which was shown in "Blast to the Past" and "The Void," (w/ the
cool hieroglyphics) should be nearby; somewhere in Robotropolis where he
could power it easily and feel most secure. (Note: Snively still has hair in
the "The Void" flashback, so it logicaly would take place before Sonic came
into the picture, (Sonic blows past-Snively's hair off - "Blast to the Past")
so Robotnik has no reason to doubt his own security, yet.) IMHO, of course.

Jon:

This might be a good time to mention this: the FAQ File, by suggestion,
is undergoing some revision.  Having achieved a considerable bulk, it
looks like I'm going to have to post it in fragments.  I'll do so
starting June 2; for the moment, I have to deal with work and the final
exam in Aramaic this week.

Specifically, no, my FAQ doesn't contain character descriptions, though
a very comprehensive Sonic description was posted here recently based on
a character development guide.  Someone indicated that they'd be working
on similar descriptions for other characters; my advice is to "Watch
This Space."

if for some reason it won't resolve the address, use 192.80.84.246

    Well, maybe, but again, teh Void is a dangerous place.  Robotnik
might have planned it far away from his base so as to keep things safe.
Also, since he planned to betray Naugas, he may have wanted to keep the
fact of the void's existance as secret as possible, and where better
than the abandoned Irongate?
    Besides, if Naugas should escape, Ol' round guy would NOT want him
to do that anywhere near his center of power...

Well, I mainly forwarded it on for informational purposes, but if you want 
a comment, here it is:

So what _wouldn't_ get clobbered by the Mighty Moronic Radar Ranges?  Does 
ABC actually think that StH's replacement will do any better?  I'll bet 
that whatever it is, it won't generate a comic, a mailing list, _and_ a 
Usenet newsgroup...

NOTICE: The fact that episode and story summaries appear here
means there is a good chance that you will encounter spoilers. 
This is your only notice!

II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
     A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
          1.   First Season: 1993-94

Super Sonic
Writer: Jules Dennis
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
things without it.

Sonic Boom
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.

Sonic's Nightmare
Writer: Frank Santopadre
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
Sally's being roboticized.

Warp Sonic
Writer: Matt Uitz
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
booster to reach and destroy it.

Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
Writer: Janis Diamond
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
mistake at the end of the second season?

Sub-Sonic
Writer: Barbara Slade
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.

Heads or Tails
Writer: Len Janson
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

Sonic Past Cool
Writers: Kayte Kuch & Sheryl Scarborough
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
Robotnik.


Sonic Racer
Writer: Len Janson
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season.

*****************************************************************
WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
plausible, except that between the November and February sweeps,
ABC actually moved StH to the 8:00 am Eastern slot, which would
have put it opposite "Dog City" on Fox...at least, until the next
time Fox jazzed with ITS lineup.  I remember posting a TAPE ALERT
and that several fans didn't get to tape the first showing of the
Doomsday episode as a result of the time switch.  Source for this
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
"Panic in the Sky!"
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hriar_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
     It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by
somehow draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps
the island afloat.  Already having established a presence on the
island, Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans
to use the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole. 
Knuckles won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes
the Chaos Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik
abandons it, expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole
(though how he suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear). 
But Knuckles replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd
tell you how he switched it with a phony one which was the one he
broke, but I don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an
invitation to join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of
the island now involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
"Fire Drill"
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
who knows?
"Lord of the Floating Island"
     While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island--how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25
"Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
Story: Mike Gallagher
Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Tails
investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To rescue
both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones and do
battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.

Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
there is no "official" explanation as to how Tails got that way,
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:   No, his real name is "Miles Prower" (you have to say it
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite
often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as "Aunt
Bunnie."  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as "Uncle Chuck," though he's
technically only uncle to Sonic.

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
notwithstanding.

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
characters are supposed to be.
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
#19.  As for the designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term "ground
squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is.

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
"flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In Your
Face #1].

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
identification is still pending.

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
"Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
is in charge.

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A:   According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"]
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
given in the "Drood Henge" episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
and that Sally wouldn't "come of age" for another two years. 
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
Tails (in "Drood Henge").

Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
actually began with "Deadliest of the Species" in Sonic #20.  The
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
Sega reportedly came together to discuss "improving" the series
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." In any event, the "improved" Sally miniseries began
shipping the week of Feb 13.


Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
so far: "Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced." [Michael
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
heap, Mike!


Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
plausible, except that between the November and February sweeps,
ABC actually moved StH to the 8:00 am Eastern slot, which would
have put it opposite "Dog City" on Fox...at least, until the next
time Fox jazzed with ITS lineup.  I remember posting a TAPE ALERT
and that several fans didn't get to tape the first showing of the
Doomsday episode as a result of the time switch.  Source for this
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics, as posted
to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
Story and art: Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
Gallagher & Shaw! again.
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night"
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.


#22 [May 1995]
"The Return," written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &
Harvey M.

The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with Children;
cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand Sonics,"
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
(hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
"Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being ruler over
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: "You owe
me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
artwork.

"Tails Knighttime Story," written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
Manak & John Dagostino.

As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has all
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows" his
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.

Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep reading." 
Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of Princess
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the "creative
differences" theory in Q7.

#23   [Jun 1995]
"Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.

Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
"Vol-ANT-teer"
     Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.



#24  [Jul 1995]
"When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski
(Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
"Panic in the Sky!"
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hriar_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that the
island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group (for
the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a while back
and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in the turboprop,
dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of the island.  After
landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms and avoiding some
traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again meets Knuckles.  Since
this is the second time Sonic has been caught trespassing, Knuckles
is about to send him over the edge of the island.  Tails tries
dropping a rock on Knuckles from above to avoid this from
happening, but it ends up that Tails has to rescue both Sonic and
Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
     It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles won't
allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos Emerald. 
With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it, expecting
that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he suddenly knows
of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles replaces the
"real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how he switched it
with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I don't understand
it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to join the Knothole
gang; part of his stewardship of the island now involves disarming
it since Robotnik is gone.
"Fire Drill"
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
who knows?
"Lord of the Floating Island"
     While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in progress
and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack of (biped)
dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about the island--
how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and Robotnik) want to
change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom.  Knuckles' exit line:
"This is my island!  And I live to protect and serve!"  The entire
story appears to exist to supply needed exposition and to nudge
Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a silver
ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also slated
for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special featuring
Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v. Knuckles story, a
Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story.  Another 48-page
special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for November '95.  Solo
Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33 (Feb-Apr '96) and a
Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25
"Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
Story: Mike Gallagher
Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping his
#1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Tails
investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To rescue both
Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones and do battle
with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the Triple
Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and Tails
miniseries.  Also staff artwork.




Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
"Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich & Ken
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.

Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is renouned for
his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.

Sally & Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.

The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
glass case: Sally!?

Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD), and one
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).



Princess Sally Miniseries #2
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed), and they never show up again.
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.

Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
Will Sonic and Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a
mother, and if so what does she look like? "Of course...her
origin may yet be told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
it in "Bloodlines" in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.



"Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
Art: Art Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)

(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)

     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.

     They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.

     Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
St. John.

     Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred.  Something which
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.

     Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF


SallyGram: Horace Hawkins (14) wishes Sally a Happy Valentine's
Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
address is princess@frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
above), which conflicts with "Sonic Conversion" and, in fact, the
rest of the second season.

any more of this message.


ISSUE 16

"Sonic Under Glass"
The Freedom Fighters finally defeated Robotnik, and Sonic and Sally are
getting married.  But Robotnik reveals that he actually lured the Freedom
Fighters to Sleepy Hollow with promises of chili dogs.  There, he put them
to sleep with gas and then trapped them inside a virtual reality glass dome.
Inside the dome, all their wishes are fulfilled so no one will even think of
escaping.  Suddenly, clocks start melting (huh?), Sonic is holding up a
broom, and Uncle Chuck comes calling.  Uncle Chuck explains what happened to
everyone.  Sonic wants to get back at Robotnik, but also doesn't want to
because everyone else is so happy.  He decides to go for it, and makes
Robotnik's war machines reverse course and head back toward Robotnik.
Without alternative, Robotnik kills the virtual reality software.  Sonic and
Sally are reunited, and Sonic decides virtual reality is not a good place to
live in.

"The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
Robotnik realizes there must be a spy in his midst because so many of his
missions have failed.  For a moment, he thought he found his spy (a mole).
He brings in the Wheel of Misfortune as a way to randomize his schemes to
destroy Mobius and prevent word of his plans getting back to Sonic.
Robotnik spins, and the wheel lands on "undersea bank heist".  Robotnik's
lackeys go out to do the job and discover a note in the vault, and the
Freedom Fighters are right behind.  Robotnik spins again, and the wheel lands
on "daring daylight art robbery".  Once again, Sonic is there, as is another
note.  Robotnik spins again, and this thime the wheel lands on "mindless act
of terrorism".  And, once again, Sonic and a note appear.  Sonic and Sally
go to Robotnik's casino, and he thinks he has Sonic.  Actually, he does for
a moment, but Sonic is rescued in time.  Finally, Robotnik realizes his
wheel is rigged and that he's still not uncovered the spy.  In the next
panel, we see a building whose sign identifies it as "Secret Intelligence
Headquarters".  Inside are Sonic, Sally, and the owl Harvey Who, the head
of secret intelligence.

Sonic-Grams notables--
(The announcements are now obsolete are omitted here.)
1. Sonic is 15 years old.
2. Sally is a squirrel (but not specifically a ground squirrel).  Antoine
gave his tail to Tails so that Tails would be able to fly.  Sonic rescued
Bunnie from the roboticizer, albeit a little late.  The comic Sally and the
cartoon Sally were different colors because, early on, Archie Comics didn't
have much information to go on as to what Sally should look like.

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
(sonic@lists.mv.net and sonic-digest@lists.mv.net)

Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.

There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is "live"
and the other is a digest.  You may change your subscription
status from "live" to digest or from digest to "live" at any time.
If you do decide to change your subscription status, be sure you
unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore, or you will
be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages twice.
See "How to Change Your Status" below for more information.

To post to the list, send your messages to sonic@lists.mv.net.
This address applies to both versions of the list.

There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read
them before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from
the ftp site in /pub/sonic/list.

The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
messages, send the command "get sonic mail.txt" (but without the
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo@lists.mv.net.

You may post information and opinions related to the characters
and stories in the Sonic comics and cartoons.  Fan-written stories
are welcome too.  You may post messages on the Sonic games to
the extent that the focus is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or
characters, and not on the games themselves.  Asking why Knuckles
rarely appears in the comics is on-topic, but asking how to become
"Super Sonic" in Sonic 3 is not.

If you feel you must flame someone (other than Robotnik (g) ), please
do so in mail directly to that person.  And as on most areas of the
'net, legally obscene material and posts of a commercial nature are not
welcome here.  

Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.

ftpmail is a service users without access to regular ftp can use to 
obtain files from the sonic list's ftp site.

There are two ftpmail servers.  For fastest results, you should probably 
use the decwrl site if you live in North or South America, or the UK site 
if you live in Europe, Asia, or Australia.

The address for the decwrl site is:  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
The address for the UK site is:  ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk 

It would be a good idea to request the help text from the server of your 
choice before you try to use ftpmail to obtain files.  For both servers, 
send the command "help" (but without the quote marks) in the body of a 
mail message to the ftpmail server.

Both servers use commands similar to regular ftp, but the commands used 
by one server generally cannot be used when working with the other server.
Because most of the Sonic list subscribers live in the Americas, the 
remainder of this text concerns the decwrl server only.

Here are some tips to make it easier to use the decwrl server.

1. You must always include the command "connect hff.mv.com".
2. Get a listing of files with the "dir" command.
3. Use "chdir" to change directory.  You are allowed to change directory
   only ONE TIME per message.  If you want to get files in multiple
   directories, you must send multiple mail messages.  The directory
   pathlist always starts /pub/sonic.
4. It is a good idea to place a "reply" command at the top of your message.
   This will help ensure your files are sent to you correctly.  It's also a
   good idea to use the "quit" command at the end so that the server will
   ignore your signature.
5. When retrieving binary files, don't forget to use the "binary" command!
   You will probably want to use the "uuencode" command after the "binary"
   command.  The "uuencode" command is always used AFTER the "binary"
   command!  If you do not specify "uuencode", your files will be sent in
   btoa format.  Contact your system administrator, your BBS SysOp, or a user
   group in your community if you need help with uudecoding.

Here are a few sample messages with valid commands for the decwrl server.

My sentiments exactly.

My subscription has finally started with #24.
I liked the story.  Nowhere as good as #22, but at least Sonic wasn't
fighting some robo-KingKong contraption...

As for the artwork...keep Mawhinney and Spaziante (and shoot me if I
spelled those names wrong), but Manak isn't anywhere near them.

For a moment there, I thought he was improving...then I noticed
that the 3rd and 4th parts of that story were Mawhinney's work :)

Greetings:

The following is from a letter my brother sent me after watching STH
(specifically, both installments of "Blast to the Past" and the sort of
lame two-parter that followed (I can't access the ep list at the
moment).  I'll say no more and let his comments speak for themselves.  I
do invite responses which I intend to pass along.

========================================================================

(excerpted from a letter dated 1/27/95):

Well, you can't say that I didn't give it a chance.  This past Saturday
(1/7) I tuned in Sonic to see what was doing.  At first I thought the
entire premise of the show dealt with reverse time travel, but
apparently it was just the one episode.

The major influence on that episode was "Quantum Leap" -- the computer
with the holograms (whose name escapes me, even though the show ended
about 20 minutes ago) was a direct cop from Ziggy in QL, as was the
whole notion of going back to the past to change the present/future.
(Actually, the first "Terminator" movie covered some of the same
ground).

It's hard for me to avoid deeper criticism of pop culture, so brace
yourself.  The nature/machine dichotomy has pretty much been done to
death, from George Lucas' Ewoks to (on a more pessimistic note) H. G.
Wells' "Time Machine".  Basically, though, the roboticizer (?) suggested
to me the Borg episodes of "Star Trek: The Next Generation".  All of
this goes back to the same anti-mechanical impulses that gave rise to
the Luddites in 19th Century England.  The whole tendency (although not,
oddly enough, the Luddites) is discussed in two of [my brother's wife's]
favorite books: Leo Marx's "The Machine In The Garden" and David Shi's
"The Simple Life," both of which I commend to your attention.

This tendency was carried on in the hyena sequence of the 1/14 program.
That bugs me, only because there are pastorals out there that are much
more honest about nature being, in Tennyson's phrase, "red in tooth and
claw".  For example, I've been rereading "The Jungle Book" after years
away from it: Kipling's colonialist politics aside, I'd forgotten his
abilities as a writer, and his willingness to include death in his view
of life.  Maybe Sonic doesn't have to go the Kipling route, but
describing the hyenas as "cannibal", while it suggests the universal
bond of all life, makes carnivores seem aberrant.  Yet the foxes in the
series should also be considered aberrant, since they are--or should
be--carnivores.  The series sidesteps this problem by infantilizing the
foxes, keeping them at a child (at best, adolescent) stage of
development.  These anthropomorphs' ancestor is, of course, Bugs Bunny,
whom Richard Adams once dismissed as "a guy in a rabbit suit" who had
nothing to do with real rabbits.

As for the lead Sonic characters, there doesn't seem to be much one can
do with them except use them for their original purpose; the series is,
after all, a half-hour commercial for Sega.  The Boss [Robotnik?] is
one-dimensional, but Sonic, Sally and the other forest-folk barely make
it to two-dimensional.  If I had to write anything for these critters,
I'd have to invent a lot of biography and motivation along the way.  The
character design is nice, but (a) the studio is borrowing Sega's designs
and (b) the studio is, after all, DIC, which has done some good work; I
still think "The Littles" was a couple of steps above the usual Saturday
AM run.

Beyond that, and their essentially adolescent perspective, Sonic and
Sally still pretty much embody the gender stereotyping of commercial
television: she's Appollonian, the planning aspect, while he's the
active, unthinking Dionysian counterpart.  You rarely see a female
protagonist, animated or otherwise, who deviates from this.  One of the
few, though, who I did like, was Gadget Hackwrench from the "Rescue
Rangers".  She combined thinker and actor, and was strong enough to
assert her own personality in a male-dominated mileau.

===========================================================================

The preceeding opinion does not necessarily reflect my own.  In fact, it
doesn't.

Stories, music, art, etc. have been developed for a very long time.  Only 
the most avant garde works have a chance at being totally original.  
Almost everything does something that's been done before, whether 
intended by the author or not.  In the case of music, the courts have 
already ruled that all possible combinations of notes have been 
exhausted, so now it's not necessary any longer to prove absolute 
originality in a defence in a copyright infringement suit.

He must be less familiar with the games than even I am.  Tails is "almost 
five" except for being ten years old in the Saturday series.  For DIC to 
portray Tails as an adult would be a non-sequitor, an inconsistency with 
the characters' point of origination (the games).

As for Bugs Bunny, why does he have to be a like a real rabbit?  Ooooh, 
six minutes of Bugs Bunny silently hopping around a meadow.  That'll keep 
us in hysterics.  (Reference to "Slappy Goes Walnuts" intended.)  
Likewise, why do Tails and Antoine (and Sally??) have to be like real 
foxes?  If they were, Bunnie wouldn't have a chance if not for her 
robotic limbs.  And since Sally is (more than likely) a squirrel, she'd 
be in trouble too.  As explained in Schneider's book, the Looney Tunes 
and Merrie Melodies were made "cartoony" in direct opposition to Disney's 
preference to realism.  If you prefer realistic animation, fine.  Pick up 
"Bambi" and "Snow White" at your local video store.

What you're asking for is an original series, not a show based on the 
game.  If you re-invent the characters, you end up with something like 
the movie "Halloween III: Season of the Witch":  a movie that has nothing 
to do with its predecessors except title.  You think there are 
differences between the two cartoon series, the two comics (US and UK), 
and the games now?  Just imagine the games being what they are now, and 
the SatAM show using only humans and taking place in New York City, and 
Robotnik is just a powerful man in the drug trade.  May as well scrap the 
game connections and make a totally new show.

There's also a matter of the budget.  The show would be very different if 
it were made by Disney (perhaps passed along to Touchstone) where much 
more could be spent on writers, animation, and so on.  Any list.members 
care to speculate on what the show would have been like if another studio 
made it?

The cartoon-commercial issue was debated extensively about ten years 
ago when we were treated to plotless cartoons like "Strawberry Shortcake" 
whose sole purpose was to sell-sell-sell.  At least "JEM" had some good 
music now and then.  "Sonic the Hedgehog" is a giant step up from there.  
The Sonic cartoons and comics have helped to develop the concept further 
and faster than the games.  Sega can't release a new Sonic game every month.

Of course, the connection to an item of merchandise is there; it's 
inseperable for this show.  But I don't think it was made to be a 
commercial any more than specifying my e-mail address in my .signature is 
an attempt to solicit customers for United States Internet, Inc.  Do you 
see in my .sig, "For the best in Internet connectivity, contact USIT at 
---"?  Do you see any blatant sales pitches in the show?

Robotnik, boss only to Snively, should be a limited character.  It would 
dilute the story if he only roboticized those who commited capital 
crimes, or if he were to apologize for what he does as he does it.  If 
Robotnik was just a component of a schizophrenic Julian, well, we'd have 
a more complex story and a less formidable opponent.

"Commercial television", hmmm, last time I checked my TV listings, my 
local PBS affiliates weren't running Sonic.  You can't blame your tires 
for being round.  I'd rather see this configuration than one like Cliff 
Huxtable who's just an amiable buffoon (just how did he manage to get 
through med school, or high school for that matter?).  Sally might have 
the "brains" but she alone can't carry out her plans, with the possible 
exception of her mini-series (she did have help from St. John).  Remember 
the episode where Sally blamed herself for not adequately planning an 
attack and some Freedom Fighters were roboticized?  Sounds like something 
I'd do too.  But Sonic was there to support her, and *together* they made 
it through.  Sega's bio of Sonic says he's of average intelligence (see 
/pub/sonic/list/sonic-bio at the ftp site) and he tends to be impatient.  
Remember when Sonic said he would do what "I do best:  wing it!"?  Sonic 
wouldn't even want Sally's "planner" role.  Not unless you re-invent him, 
and now we're back to may as well make an original series.

[One person's negative opinion and a Sonic lister's excellent rebuttal
deleted]

Here here!  Glad to see somebody can argue my opinions better than I can!

Perhaps this is why I got a C in my English 'Analysis of American Television'
class.  The prof didn't seem to appreciate the fact that I did not see
TV as some 'medium that only serves to cater to hegemonic opinion' (or
whatever the exact terms were, like I said, I got a C), but that I for one
can still enjoy it for the story-telling and that I also know where the
off-switch is if need be...

Dan Drazen, if I may be so bold, you ought to send that response to your
brother.

   The problem with scientifically analyzing a children's cartoon show is
just that.  If it was intended to be scientifically accurate (like all the
"Star Trek"s) a lot of the questions like "What is Sally?" [squirrel damnit!]
and "How come Sonic can run so fast?" would be answered.  These are basic
questions analogous to "How does a transporter work?"  When you think about
it, Sonic has gotten pretty far considering it started out as a game and was
never intended to go beyond that.  It's now our job to fill in the gaps.

    I'm not saying that he's by any means that hot-- and yes, I know

Does Manak's style appeal more to the younger sector of the readership
(say 5-10 year-olds), I wonder? 

Speaking of Dave Manak: late last year I was looking through some stacks of
second-hand comic books looking for any Sonic back issues, when I noticed
Manak's signature on a cover from 1989.  It was an issue of ALF.  The best
part was the inside front cover, which had an ad for the Sonic 1 game.
Apparently Manak did much of the pencilling on ALF, which made it to issue
50 before it was cancelled.  I think it would be a great gag if Alf made a
cameo appearance in a Manak story, although I doubt the licensing folks 
would ever allow it.  I can see it now: Alf: "Made a wrong turn on my way 
home [from Earth], and wound up here on Mobius instead of Melmac."

Greetings.

It was reported last week that, according to an internal source at
Archie Comics, the REAL reason Sonic the Hedgehog was cancelled on
Saturday morning was the fact that it was up against the Mighty Morphin'
Power Rangers on Fox.

In the interest of accuracy, I did a little research in some back issues
of _TV Guide_ we haven't thrown out/recycled yet.

When the second Sonic season began on September 17, 1994, the show was
up against Beethoven on CBS and MMPR on Fox.  The lineup stayed that way
until December 10, when ABC moved Sonic from 8:30 (Eastern) to 8:00.
This move, too late to rescue the numbers from the November sweeps, now
put Sonic up against Disney's The Little Mermaid on CBS and Jim Henson's
Dog City on Fox. This situation held steady until February 4, the
beginning of the February sweeps.  Fox shifted its lineup and Sonic was
once again in the same time slot as MMPR.  The 1-2 punch of being up
against MMPR during two sweeps periods in a row probably was, indeed,
the reason the show was cancelled.  Pity.

Well, I take comfort in the fact that Morphin' Mania, like Disco Fever,
will run its course one day.  Whether Sega and DiC will want to make
another run at SatAM remains to be seen.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.
