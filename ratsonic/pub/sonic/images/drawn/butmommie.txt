Recently I made a nifty black & white picture in reference to the  
flashforward from the "Sonic: In Your Face" Special, where we see King  
Sonic and Queen Sally with two children.

The picture shows Sonic and Sally in a 'private moment'... I called it  
"Scenes we will now probably never going to see because of EndGame".

If you are interested, check out

Don't worry, it doesn't show any 'mature contents', it's just funny. :)

Bye
