WHAT'S NEW?:
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]

     Knuckles #5 [Sep 1997]
     Cover art: continued from last issue.  This one actually has
some connection to the story inside.  I could say something about
the dingoes depicted on the front cover but I understand there
are kids lurking nearby.
     Yet ANOTHER great cameo (or whatever) from Spaz/Harvo,
though Julie-Su's boots look a bit overdrawn.  The figures of the
dingo and of Lara-Le are the most impressive due to their being
lit from below, and there's something about Lara-Le's haunted
expression that I find unusually compelling.  

RDB note: the anime eyes might have something to do with it...

     The splash page.  OK, you can look at it one of two ways:
either the drawing (which I think is too nice to be used as
wallpaper) is a contrast of Knuckles As Loner in the foreground
and when he was actually part of a real family in the background;
or else there's a Knuckles sibling that Ken's going to spring on
us at some point.  And if that sib happens to have violet eyes, 
then maybe that music Archy was hearing in the last issue wasn't
"Lohengrin" so much as that banjo music from "Deliverance."  If you 
don't get my meaning, e-mail me; like I said, there ARE children about.

RDB note: I saw "Deliverance" albeit 25+ years ago when I was a kid, 
but I don't remember it dealing with _that_...

     Page 1: I could have done without the Lucas reference; as an
attempt at humor it was too (forgive the pun) Forced.  But I LOVE
the dialogue between Locke and...OK, it isn't "Sir" from the last
issue because he was brown and not red.  All the same, the
dialogue itself is great stuff.  If you tighten it up a little:

     "I know what you're thinking."
     "How?"
     "I know you."
     "Oh."
     "I also know her."
     "What's SHE thinking?"
     "How would I know?"

It reads like great Absurdist drama, along the lines of Samuel
Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" or (more specifically) Tom
Stoppard's "Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."  But let's
get down to business:
     "Lost Paradise: Part 2: Fallout"
     Writer: Ken Penders; Penciler: Manny Galan, Inker: Andrew Pepoy
     Ranger Smith, whose real name is "Constable Remington", has
just busted Knuckles, Archimedes, and Julie-Su.  Still, he
recognized Knuckles as being a Guardian (must've read the Letters
page in the last issue), and uses the old trap door bit to
separate the boys from the girl.  Knuckles and Archy end up in
what looks like someone's apartment, but before we're introduced...
     Remember the appearing and disappearing of Echidnaopolis in
the last issue?  I didn't think that was all that impressive, to
be honest with you.  But the second and third panels on page 6
MORE than make up for it!  We get to see two separate worlds 
(one populated by echidnas, the other by rather military-looking
dingoes) phase-shift across each other's paths.  The inhabitants
of both worlds are freaked out.  One dingo reports this turn of
events to a General Stryker, who's so buff that he reminds me (a
little too much) of Ahnold the Alsatian from Tiny Toons.  He
apparently also has the same barber as Beavis and Butt-head's gym
teacher, Mr. Buzzcut. [Footnote: this is apparently the character
who was originally named "General Von Speer" until Sega put their
corporate foot down and demanded a name change, as also reported
by Ken Penders at the Motor City Comic Con].  Just as well; if
he'd been given a Teutonic name, the temptation to think of him
as sounding like Ahnold would be even greater.
     Back underground, Knuckles is introduced to his host: 
a VERY old Guardian, specifically "your great-grandfather seven
generations removed."  By skipping ahead a few pages we deduce
that this is none other than Hawking!  Only now, as befits his
namesake, he's confined to a wheelchair.  The years (and
apparently there have been a LOT of them!) have not been kind. 
He has Knuckles start playing a set of video discs that show his
exploits during his "tenure as Guardian over 200 years ago."  

RDB note: and without the cheesy grin that his statue from #4 has...

We see him in pursuit of dingoes who have stolen some military
hardware.  We also learn that, according to the Geezer Guardian,
the dingoes have always been warlike and have always stolen
echidna technology, including...
     OK, the LAST time I saw missiles like that was in the
atrocious "Mecha Madness" story.  Mike Gallagher displayed NO
credibility when it came to discussing nuclear weaponry.  Here's
hoping Ken can learn from the past.
     Speaking of the past, Hawking (who is now wearing that
snazzy hat worn by Knuckles in the Sonic _anime_) is shown giving
instructions of some kind WRT the missiles to yet ANOTHER Guardian, 
this one wearing a dreadlock ring with the letter "M" on it.  
It's yet another tease as we follow Hawking into one of the 
underground tech storage vaults to fetch "perhaps the only possible 
solution" to their crisis: a remote control unit for an RC car?
     Ad on the facing page for: the ill-fated "Endgame" series,
including #50 which they insist on calling a "commemorative
issue."  Technically, something "commemorative" serves as a
reminder of someone or something, or else honors someone's death. 
The use of the word might have made sense if Sally really DID
kick it in the course of the story arc; as it stands, and given
the use of a certain character's silhouette in the "Endgame"
logo, it appears that the issue is intended to be a tribute to
Dr. Robotnik.  Any hope on my part that we'll ever see the
"director's cut" of #50 has pretty much dimmed; I just want to
forget that that whole sorry arc ever happened!
     Fan Art: Joshua Bails of "Waren", Michigan (wonder if that's
anywhere near "Warren", Michigan?) draws a "Knuckles" attacking...
either it's a pirate or somebody's maiden aunt.  And the Small 
Names In No Particular Order Page: note to the parents of 
"Joel  A Punch Is Worth A Thousand Words' Blackwood": get therapy.
     Back to the flashback as Hawking uses the remote control to
activate some kind of countermeasure against the incoming
missiles.  The sequence is given supposed weight by Hawking's
narration: "I was breaking the most solemn vow a Guardian swears
before all else!  For the first time I wondered which mattered
more--my people--or my conscience!"  Gee, if I'm looking at the
prospect of my fellow echidnas being turned into extra crispy
nuggets because one of my ancestors had a problem with
technology, and if I DON'T use that technology a huge chunk of
the population I'm supposed to be guarding is going to buy the
harp farm, I'd call that decision a no-brainer!
     Basically, what Hawking did was something that any first
year cadet at Starfleet Academy would have done: "Raise shields!" 
The "energy shields" managed to save Echidnaopolis but of course
the rest of the island was in jeopardy from the radioactive
debris.  So, having bought some time and after going through
Dimitri/Enerjak's papers (which apparently included a copy of
Sonic #50), Hawking came up with the Hyper Zone Projector which
transported Echidnaopolis to another zone.  Three hours,
seventeen minutes, forty-two seconds into the future, perhaps. 
The Dingo Empire (or whatever they called it) was similarly
treated but sent to a different time zone.
     This doesn't tie everything up in a neat package -- at that
age, I guess Hawking is suffering from an advanced case of loose
continuity.  He then shows Knuckles a statue of the Floating
Island as supported by Edmund and another echidna whose name is
"conveniently" out of the frame.  Hawking tells Knuckles that it
symbolizes both his heritage and responsibility.  Knuckles has
"more questions than ever before", and he ain't the only one. 
But in the true spirit of dysfunctional families, Hawking tells
Knuckles to "shut up and listen."
     At least he TRIES to, until a timely tremor cuts him off in
mid-sentence.  It's Julie-Su, ready to blow her top because she
hasn't put in an appearance since page 4.  Constable Remington
decides that because she was keeping company with Knuckles at the
time they were arrested she is automatically a "representative"
of the Guardian and therefore qualified to handle a hostage
crisis.  That strikes me as a little like saying that by virtue
of genetics my twin brother and I are qualified to switch jobs,
but at least it keeps her involved in the plot.  Somehow,
Remington's lumping the dingoes in with what he tells Julie-Su
are "your kind" really makes me question his judgment.
     Anyway, cut back to Knuckles who watches Hawking levitate himself 
back into his wheelchair.  OK, so maybe "confined" isn't the best word.
Anyway, Knuckles and Archy now see that dingoes are holding his mom, 
Lara-Le, hostage.  Also involved, according to Remington, is 
"her consort."  Lighten up, Remington, you can say "boyfriend."  
Knuckles, I'm sure, could come up with an alternative label.
     OK, I can be pretty slow on the uptake sometimes -- hey,
I AM 45 years old! -- but it's beginning to look to me as if
"Guardian" can also be pronounced "Superhero."  In the discs we
see Hawking flying through the air, wearing Captain Marvel
gloves, and only now is it all beginning to fall into place: the
powers, the solitude, Hawking's longevity, the deference shown by
Remington.  I'm beginning to see where this is going and,
frankly, I've got mixed emotions about it.
     Earlier in the story Knuckles had described himself as "just
an ordinary Joe doing his job" and that was pretty much the way
I'd thought of him as well.  I'd thought nothing unusual about
Knuckles' flying/gliding/whatever.  Then again, I'd thought
nothing unusual about Sonic's speed or Tails' ability to fly. 
Seemed to make sense in the context of Mobius.  That's one of the
reasons I disliked "Bedtime Tails" (Sonic #38); it seemed as if
Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders were tinkering with a crossover
between a furry book and a muscle-and-spandex book without either
trying for a full-blown parody of the superhero genre or treating
the characters as if they actually WERE superheroes.  And given
the rather depressing crop of superheroes nowadays (Spawn, the
Maxx), the genre NEEDS to take itself less seriously!
     Unfortunately, muscle-and-spandex are the coin of the realm for 
comic books, and it looks like the Knuckles story is going to be no 
exception.  Poor Knuckles isn't about to get buff (we now have 
Gen. Stryker for that), and I hope he doesn't decide to go with 
a dorkey costume.  Unfortunately, he's showing some of the same 
dysfunctional characteristics as the Dark Knight model of Batman.
     Let's see what we have so far: he's been raised in
isolation, apart from anything resembling a family, so it's no
wonder he didn't exactly relate well to his own mother in the
last issue -- he probably never really bonded with her, and after
spending so much time with just his dad (who is, in effect, in
hiding from his own son) his social skills are shot.  It also
probably goes a long way toward explaining why Locke's marriage
to Lara-Le went sour.  Since the hidden figure on page 1
professed not to understand "Jenna" or Lara-Le (whom he claims to
know nevertheless), I get the sense that perhaps MOST Guardians
who grew up in this system had such poor social skills that
troubled relationships were the rule rather than the exception. 
And in claiming to "know" and "not understand" at the same time,
it's an indication of just how blind to the problem the Guardians
are!  In addition, Knuckles has also inherited a rigid code of
behavior that is NOT to be questioned; it almost prevented him
from striking up a friendship with Princess Sally in "Black And
Blue And Red All Over" (Sonic #44).  He's only gradually getting
to know his relatives whose one common denominator seems to be a
well-developed knack for keeping secrets from each other and
especially from Knuckles.  Even the dialogues between Guardians
other than Knuckles (Locke and "Sir", for instance) leave too
much unsaid and convey a sense that these are NOT happy campers;
Ken has yet to portray ONE Guardian who demonstrates anything
resembling peace of mind.  Any way you slice it, this whole
Guardian system leaves a lot to be desired psychologically.
Maybe it's my middle-age disillusionment with the IDEA of
superheroism coming through.  Still, I'm beginning to understand
why the office of Guardian is hereditary: no echidna in his/her
right mind would WANT the job.  In the words of John Lennon,
"I wouldn't do it for a giggle."
     Postcards For The Time Being Until We Pick A New Name:
Knuckles #6, Sonic #51, and a VERY NICE film noir cover of Sonic #52.  
The INSIDES should only be so impressive.  And letters: leave it to 
a Californian to ask Knuckles if he has "a sensitive side"; the 
rather telling reply, "I'd like to think so but I'd never admit it."  
Let's see: psychologists recognize that dysfunctional families tend 
to live by three hard and fast rules: Don't Talk; Don't Trust; Don't Feel.  
Knuckles has grown up apart from the society of which he's supposed to be 
a Guardian; the Guardians who are supposed to be initiating him into the
office seem to have an attitude best summed up by Hawking's "Shut up and 
listen" so it seems that they don't even trust the kid; and he's not 
even honest about his own feelings.  John Bradshaw, call your office.

     Project" episode?  And what would have happened during the third
     season?

================================================================

Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 ("All The Mail's About
Tails!").  Theories range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest
entry is in the Sonicgram of #22. They state that Tails just happened to
be born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the difference
between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point, there is no
"official"  explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty
much free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory that
it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.  This would
accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when Robotnik took over
(cf. Q6). the third season?

Q2: Is "Tails" his real name?
A:  No, his real name is "Miles Prower"  (you have to say it sorta fast to
get the joke).  That was his name when he was introduced on the front
screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails was given as his nickname, and it
stuck. 

Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her "Aunt Sally" quite often.
A:This argument has been put forward by the "Sally is a fox" camp (see
below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be related to Bunnie,
as he's been known to address her as "Aunt Bunnie."  For that matter, it
seems that everyone in the Knothole gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as
"Uncle Chuck," though he's technically only uncle to Sonic. 

While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom fighters'
families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of Mobius.  It's safe to
assume that they all have had relatives who have ended up being
roboticized.  As a result, they have become not so much a paramilitary
resistance group as a loose-knit family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly
relates to Tails as if the latter was his little brother, the difference
in species notwithstanding. 

Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the characters are
supposed to be.
A: Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
than others.  Herewith is the list:
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox

The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on extended
discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground squirrel in the
comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic #19.  As for the
designation "ground squirrel/chipmunk", which has been questioned by at
least one correspondent, I entered it this way on the assumption that the
two terms were synonymous.  I have consulted a dictionary, which states
that the term "ground squirrel" applies to several kinds of rodents,
including the chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
designation will remain as is. 

Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species has been
particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who reason that since
Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must be one herself.  It is
possible that Sally takes after her mother in this regard more than her
father.  Cross-species mating is a definite possibility, and an example is
implied in the "flashforward" at the end of "Sally's Crusade" [Sonic: In
Your Face #1]. 

At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie, remains
ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a beaver or a
woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long cloak, I've been
unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final identification is still
pending. 

Q5: "Sally Acorn"?
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning of the
comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically, royalty do not have
surnames or family names in the accepted sense; rather, the title of the
personage tends to serve the purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is
apparently seldom used (cf.  "Blast to the Past," part 1).  If you wanted
to be grandiose about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia,
Princess of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik is in
charge. 

Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
A: According to the TV series ["Blast to the Past: part 1"] Sonic and
Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was overthrown and
Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were given in the "Drood Henge"
episode: that Tails was 10 years old, and that Sally wouldn't "come of
age" for another two years. At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given
as being 16, though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age
15. Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in
charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma would be
to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of 18; that would
eliminate the extra year differential without altering the stated ages of
Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of Tails (in "Drood Henge"). 


Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
A: "That the Princess Sally miniseries came out at all is a minor
miracle," according to Ken Penders, co-writer of the series with Mike
Kanterovich.  Archie Comics was late in rolling out the three-part
miniseries starring Sally as the main character--a situation acknowledged
in the SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with "Deadliest of the
Species" in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries, however,
differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the first issue
prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
issue cover either did or didn't feature Sally doing battle with a clone
of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two different versions of
the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. The fact that the Sally creative
team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS SEGA reportedly came together to discuss
"improving" the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of "creative
differences." 

"In fairness to the people at SEGA," Ken writes, "they wanted to create a
viable environment where the public would be anticipating more Princess
Sally products such as her own video game or line of t-shirts or whatever,
and the ...[mini]series represented the beginning of that, so it was
important to them that it was done the best it could be."  "Scott
[Fulop]," he adds, "was pulling his hair out during the entire process
doing his best to keep things moving along." 

So why haven't there been subsequent Sally miniseries?  "The Princess
Sally miniseries just didn't do well enough to warrant another shot.  From
what we can tell, it seems there was a problem with distribution which
prevented a lot of people from finding and picking up the book.  You also
had the core audience of little boys that [sic] felt awkward picking up a
title that they felt was aimed more at girls.  However, when you plopped a
copy into their hands and made them read the first issue, that's all it
took.  They were hooked." 

Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently the same
way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. I'm serious; here
is the only print explanation I've come across so far: "Years ago, when
things were right on Mobius, there lived a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic
was only interested in running as fast as he could.  Every day he
practiced." [Michael Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll,
1993, pp.7- 8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation. 
Thanks a heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about "The rumor going
around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from falling into a vat of
power rings when he was a baby." 

Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you like:
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
of the "Doomsday" episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
you say "anal retentive"?).  Words were exchanged and the show
was effectively cancelled.
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
of "two seasons and out" for shows.  Though it's possible that
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
to begin with.

Q10: Why was Rotor called "Boomer" in the early comics?
A: They finally got around to providing an answer to this one in Sonic #29
(Dec 1995).  The explanation: "Rotor is Rotor's real name.  Boomer was
something we used to call him when we were kids to make fun of his voice." 
So basically we're supposed to believe "Boomer" is really Rotor's
nickname. 

Q11: What exactly is in those chili dogs?
A: When a story is set on a planet populated by sentient animals, the
question of their eating habits is no small matter. How would a planet
whose population would include intelligent cows and pigs deal with the
subject of eating something usually thought to be made out of pork and/or
beef?  While several members of the Sonic mailing list have suggested that
the dogs in Sonic's chili dogs are fashioned from some meat analog (see
below), a possible answer appeared at the end of "Let's Get Small" (Sonic
#33).  In the last panel, Sonic whips up a batch of chicken soup which,
Rotor explains, is "made with chili dogs."  Since you can't very well call
it "chicken soup" if it doesn't contain any chicken (at least as far as
government regulations are concerned), it would appear that those chili
dogs Sonic has been scarfing for all these years are made using chicken
franks!

This theory elicited the following response from Ken Penders:  "they're
made from soybeans or some form of seafood by-products, and let's leave it
at that.  Sheeesh!  Some things are better off left alone!"  Not as far as
THIS crowd is concerned.  You knew the job was dangerous when you took it,
Ken. 

Q12: What's happening with the Sonic movie?
A: At one point (Sonic #19), a hint was dropped in the Sonic-Gram that a
Sonic the Hedgehog film was in the works.  After that, however, there was
no news.  In the summer of 1996, however, a blurb about a Sonic movie
appeared in a magazine for video gamers.  Try as I might, I could never
determine which magazine it came from or what the exact wording of the
blurb was.  In any event, fans seized on this spark of a rumor and fanned
it into flame.  Paul Castiglia at Archie Comic helped matters (or didn't,
as will be seen below) by issuing a clarifying statement that perhaps the
fans were thinking of the upcoming "An X-Tremely Sonic Christmas" special
to be shown some time during Thanksgiving Week, 1996, on the USA cable
network.  Interest remained high until, in response to repeated questions,
Paul confessed that the script called for Sonic and Tails to confound
Robotnik's plan to impersonate Santa Claus, aided by Scratch and Grounder. 
Yes, turns out the special was a spinoff of the syndicated series and not
the SatAM series.  Interest in the special promptly sank like a stone.  As
for the film, the latest word on that came from Paul Castiglia's press
release touting the "Sonic Live" special, wherein Paul tosses off the fact
that Sonic is "being optioned for a feature motion picture."  Translation: 
don't hold your breath waiting. 

Q13: Why do the colors on some pages of SonicQuest #2 look so weird? 

Why does Knuckles look like he's been dipped in chocolate?  Why isn't
Sonic his usual shade of blue?  Why does Snively's skin have the same hue
as a cup of rosehip tea?  In short, why ARE pages 1, 7, 8, [16], 17, and
the Find Your Name and Fan Art pages of SonicQuest #2 so off-color? 

A: "It's completely the printer's fault," according to Paul Castiglia.  To
print a four-color comic like Sonic The Hedgehog, the artwork that comes
from the likes of Pat Spaziante or Art Mawhinney has to undergo a process
called color separation.  The color printing of a comic book works the
same way as a color picture on a TV screen or computer monitor.  What
appears on the page to be a solid color is actually a composite of four
different colors: black, red (or magenta), yellow, and blue (or cyan) in
varying amounts.  If you've ever tried customizing colors for a utility
like Paintbox you know what I'm talking about. 

Anyway, when it came time to print the aforementioned pages, according to
Paul, "the printer shot the red plate twice."  Which means that the red
values were twice what they were supposed to be.  With much more red than
was called for, a condition known as "oversaturation" set in, and it
apparently went undetected by the printer once the presses started to
roll.  So some of the pages came out looking like they'd been printed with
mud. 

The comic is "PRINTED IN CANADA" as it proudly says in the fine print in
the front of every issue, and not in-house at Archie Comics in Mamaroneck,
New York.  So when the finished issue landed on the desks at Mamaroneck,
"we hit the roof!...no one [was] more horrified that US at the final
result!!!" 

Unfortunately, "this issue was running late" so it apparently went out
into the distribution pipeline before anyone could notice the issue's, uh,
"beauty marks".  "With our former printer, we used to get make-readys
[final-run quality copies to be used for proofreading, etc.] in
advance....  We used to have about a 2-day window to say 'WHOA!  Stop the
presses--you screwed up!' with them."  In this case, the haste to
distribute assured that nobody knew about the oversaturated pages until it
was too late. 

The end result?  The printer will probably institute some kind of quality
control system in the wake of this "debacle."  They have also apologized
to Archie, which will receive a credit on future work.  And we've got some
strange-looking pages.  Could be worse:  another correspondent reports
that in one issue of the British Sonic comic (published by Fleetway), a
mistake in the composing room resulted in the SAME EXACT WORD BALLOONS
being used on two consecutive pages.  This resulted in the loss of key
bits of dialogue and ruined continuity.  So I guess we got off easy on
this side of the Atlantic. 

Q14: Where did the name "Robotnik" come from?
A: "Robotnik" is Czechoslovakian.  The word literally means "worker".
It arrived in the English-speaking world by way of the play "RUR" [which
stands for "Rossum's Universal Robots" by Karel Capek.  There have long
been stories of mechanical beings come to life, from Pinocchio to the
Golem of Prague, but it wasn't until Capek that the word "robot" came to
be used for such a being.  Since there exists no small debate as to the
extent to which a Mobian becomes mechanical when roboticized, it's
debatable as to whether the process turns anyone into a "true" (100%)
robot.

Q15: Who was that red-eyed figure at the very end of the "Doomsday
Project" episode?  And what would have happened during the third season? 
A: The identity of the figure accompanying Snively at the end of
"Doomsday" has been the subject of quite a bit of speculation. The most
popular guesses have included Knuckles and Mecha-Sonic. To get the
straight dope, longtime list member Alessandro Sanasi in Germany managed
to track down none other than Ben Hurst, writer of the episode in question
and (with Pat Allee) one of the key writers for the second season of
Sonic.  Here is the result of their exchange of e-mail: 

"The red eyes you saw were NAGUS, the sorcerer trapped in the Void."  In
addition, it turns out that Robotnik indeed survived the destruction of
the Doomsday device: "At the moment the Doomsday machine was destroyed,
[Nagus] was able to exploit the energies [released by the destruction as
well as by the Deep Power Stones, presumably] and pull Robotnik into the
Void." 

Hold onto your seats for a thumbnail outline of the third season: 
"Snively takes over...Robotropolis...during the first two episodes, he
battles the Freedom Fighters.  Without Robotnik's cunning, however, he
finds himself on the brink of losing everything.  Meanwhile, Nagus is
having a delightful time 'torturing' Robotnik [cf. the malicious
shape-shifting Robotnik underwent in "The Void"] while plotting
his...escape. He's...  discovered the magic which will enable him to leave
the Void without turning to crystal...But...Robotnik has found a means to
communicate with Snively--telling the little guy his location. 
Snively...tells Robotnik where he can get off. 

"But then, as the Freedom Fighters are on the brink of taking over
Robotropolis, Snively opens the Void, releasing Robotnik-- and
accidentally releasing Nagus and Sally's father....  Now Nagus is in
charge, Robotnik is his "Snively" [i.e., lackey], and Snively becomes a
nobody.  Nagus uses the King to bait a trap to catch Sally.  Robotnik
plots to regain his power and Snively defects to the Freedom Fighters." 

Wow!  And he didn't even plan on killing anyone, either!

for Sally's father proves futile.

Sonic and Sally
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a "Stepford
Sally."

Hooked on Sonics
Writer: Randy Rogel
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
has to rescue him.

Ultra Sonic
Writer: David Villaire
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a

Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
Mobius.

Harmonic Sonic

On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.

generator.

          2.   Second Season: 1994-95

Game Guy
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
about a list of other freedom fighters.

Sonic Conversion
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.

No Brainer
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.

Blast to the Past (two parts)
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
would not get captured.

Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made "king"
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
"honor" of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
ineptitude.

Dulcy
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
time to hatch the egg.

The Void
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the "Great
Unknown" [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.

The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
for Antoine.

Cry of the Wolf
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
a lightning storm and destroys it.

Drood Henge
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
can get to it.

Spyhog
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
back underground with a different cover.

Doomsday
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
season (see FAQ #9).

     B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]

Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
original four-part Sonic miniseries:

Issue 0
     "Don't Cry For Me, Mobius"
     Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
     Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
referred to as "Boomer.")  Antoine then announces that there is a
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
ring.
     "The Royal Family of Mobius"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.

Issue 1
     "Run, Sally, Run"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
and almost throws her into the "Robo-machine."  Sonic rescues
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.

Issue 2
     "A Crowning Achievement"
     Gallagher/Shaw!
     Sally decides to wear the "Crown of the Acorn Kings" which
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.


Issue 3
     "Sonic Flashback"
     Gallagher & Shaw!
     Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
Robotnik.
     "Why Ask Spy"
     Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
destroys the factory.


And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
     "Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!"
     Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
     One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
called "Krudzu" and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
     "You Bet My Life!"
     Gallagher & Manak
     Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
casino was rebuilt for "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G." (#16); the
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
the "Game Guy" episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
called "Boomer" at this time.  DJD]

#2  [Sep 1993]
     "Triple Trouble"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
     "Vertigo A Go Go!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
     "All The Mail's About Tails"
     Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
     Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
something dealing with evolution.

#3  [Oct 1993]
     "The Bomb Bugs Me"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has "the
bomb."  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
to trick Crabmeat into giving "the bomb" to the freedom fighters,
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
Boomer suit.
     "Rabbit Deployment"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
they are "tied up."  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]

#4  [Nov 1993]
     "The Lizard of Odd!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
"Lizard Lips" belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
roboticizer [see above, "Rabbit Deployment"], and cuts
Universalamander down to size.
     "Tails' Little Tale"
     Gallagher/Manak
     While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.


#5  [Dec 1993]
     "Olympic Trials and Errors"
     Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
     Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik "promises"
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
repeated in "That's The Spirit" (#20). DJD]
     "Chomp on This, Chump!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
Fighter" (#23). DJD]

#6  [Jan 1994]
     "The Spin Doctor"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
be rescued by Tails.
     "Sonic's Christmas Carol"
     Decesare/Manak
     [The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
straightened out. DJD]

#7  [Feb 1994]
     "Uncle Chuck's Treasure"
     Decesare/Manak
     When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
Chuck.  They believe the "treasure" may be an invention that will
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
that the "treasure" is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
     "Sorceress in Distress"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
to be real.  Robotnik sees the "sorceress" and, unaware that it's
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
sorceress's "magic" and Sally obliges, with a little help from
Sonic.


#8  [Mar 1994]
     "Bot's All, Folks!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, "Botman," "Wolvurkel" (a
factory second sent by mistake), "Spawnmower," "Magbot--Freedom
Fighter Fighter," "Captain Marbot" and "Mighty 'Bot."  [Furries
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  "Wolvurkel"
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
     "A Little Music Goes A Long Way"
     Gallagher/Manak
     Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of

     "Pseudo-Sonic!"
     Gallagher/Manak
     After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
builds his ultimate eil robot, "Pseudo-Sonic."  Meanwhile, Sonic
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
     "What's the Point?"
     Decesare/Manak
     While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
say, was behind the mechanical trees).


#10  [May 1994]
     "Revenge of the Nerbs!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
"Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society" can apprehend them, the
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
     "'Twan With The Wind"
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
     The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.


#11  [Jun 1994]
     "The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
     The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a "short cut" via the Cosmic
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
Antisonic (c.f., "When Hedgehogs Collide," #24) and the
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
Robotnik.
     "Beat The Clock"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Wanting to get to the top slot of Robotnik's Top Ten Badnik
List, Coconuts traps the freedom fighters.
     "Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
Sonic wakes up.


#12  [Jul 1994]
     "A Timely Arrival"
     Gallagher/Mawhinney
     Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.
     "Bold-Headed Eagle"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.
     "The Lynx Is A Jinx"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.


#13  [Aug 1994]
     "This Island Hedgehog"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
Sonic recovers the Emerald.
     "Space In Your Face"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.


#14  [Sep 1994]
     "Tails' Taste of Power"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.
     "Do It Yourself Sonic"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Readers are invited to fill in the word balloons and color
the panels on a page to create their own comic (apparently
involving Robotnik interrupting Sonic and Tails on a fishing
trip).  Winners announced in issue #23.
     "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-
trapped shopping mall.  After they're caught, the girls accuse
Robotnik of being a MCP; they then smash SWATbots and gift-wrap
Robotnik.


#15  [Oct 1994]
     "Rockin' The Bot!"
     Decesare/Manak
     While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
crafts a giant flyswatter.
     "What's The Big Idea?"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.
     "Animal Magnetism"
     Decesare/Mawhinney
     Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.
     


#16  [Nov 1994]
     [Summary by Erich Schulman]
     "Sonic Under Glass"
     It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
     "The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G."
     Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
spin, he lands on "undersea bank heist."  Robotnik's lackey's
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
     Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. "The Mail's About
Tails" (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
from the roboticizer ("Rabbit Deployment," #3).  On a more
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.



#17  [Dec 1994]
     "Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
     Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.
     "First Star I See Tonight: Sally's Crusade, part 1"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.



#18 [Jan 1995]:
     "Wedding Bell Blues"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Manak
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
plans an attack.
     "In the Still of the Night" (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
"First Star....", #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
     Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
     "Sally's Crusade: The Quest"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
spelled out in a "flashforward" at the end of the story.
     "Mirror Zone"
     Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
     An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
     Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as "about 15."  [Note, if
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
     "Tails' Tallest Tale"
     Story and art: Scott Shaw!
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
Shaw!.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
     "Night of a Thousand Sonics"
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
second.
     Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as "King
Acorn" (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
is identified as a "ground squirrel."  Hint is dropped as to a
Sonic motion picture in the works.

#20 [Mar 1995]:
     "That's the Spirit"
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): "Give Mobius
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!"
     "Deadliest of the Species"
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
     Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.

#21 [Apr 1995]:
     "3 Phases of E.V.E"
     /Spaziante
     Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. ["exceptionally versatile
evolvoid"] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
tease--stay tuned.
     Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.



Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
     Summary by Ron Bauerle
     "Deadliest of the Species!" written by Mike Kanterovich &
          Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney & Rich Koslowski.
     Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
far and describes the main characters (get this: "Antoine is
renouned for his military skills" - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally & Geoffrey
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
     Also some fan art: two pics of Sally & Bunnie (both NBD),
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).




#22 [May 1995]
     "The Return"
     Penders/Spaziante & Harvey M.
     The story opens with Sonic & Sally MCW (Married with
Children; cf. the end of "Sally's Quest" in _In Your Face #1_). 
Sonic & Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics," (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter "R-R") remains resident.  Robotnik
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
deactivates "Operation Wasteland" himself to keep from being
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
"You owe me!"  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
Spaziante artwork.
     "Tails Knighttime Story,"
     Decesare/Manak & John Dagostino
     As Tails grumps about "get[ting] baby-sat" while Sonic has
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who "borrows"
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
     Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: "Keep
reading."  Translation: "we're working on it!").  The cover of
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
"creative differences" theory in Q7.


Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species": Part 2
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
     (Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
volunteers to stay with him.
     Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
opposed).
     Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
Sally to Robotnik.
     Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
Sally marry? "Could be."  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
forthcoming 48-page S&K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
if so what does she look like? "Of course...her origin may yet be
told."  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in "Bloodlines"
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.


#23   [Jun 1995]
     "Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter"
     Decesare/Manak
     Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
order to save Robotnik from "disposal," Sonic convinces Car-Heem
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
which I'm not going to reveal.
     Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
     "Vol-ANT-teer"
     Decesare/Manak
     Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
isn't exactly clueless.
     Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.


Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
     "Deadliest of the Species, Part III"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney
(Summary: James Firmiss)
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
     Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
the chamber blows up because a "feedback loop" has occurred. 
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
"moles".  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
serious lip-locking before they part.

     If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:

     The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
leader of the "Rebel Underground" and acted as a double agent in
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
was an automated Sally:
     
     1. "Auto" Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
     2. "Auto" Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
     while the real Sally always called him "Mr. St. John."

     The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
replaced by a robot double.

     And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
unexpected happened.

"This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats...."  JF

SallyGram: Horace Hawkins (14) wishes Sally a Happy Valentine's
Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
     "When Hedgehogs Collide" (in 4 parts)
     Script: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders
     Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney & Rich
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
     Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from "The Good, The
Bad and the Hedgehog" [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
"the Antisonic," as in "the Antichrist") is looking for some
action, so he rounds up the "gang" consisting of the Antisally,
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
"negative reality" though they were unable to penetrate "the Zone
of Silence" (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
strategies.  So it's "Change partners!" as play is resumed: Sonic
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
peacefully.
     I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
     PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
     PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
the work and "kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!"  At least,
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
to...
     SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a "Sonic + Bunnie" graffiti
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with "Sonic +
Sally," "Sonic + Nicole"--THAT I'd like to see!--and "Sonic +
Sonic"], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
     SonicGram: information on two upcoming "special" issues: the
48-page Sonic & Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
the "Silver Anniversary" issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of "Do-It-
Yourself Sonic Contest" winners who have moved and left no
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.

Sonic & Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
     "Panic in the Sky!"
     Kanterovich & Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
     The Mobians living on the western shore of "the Great
Continent" [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
another adjective besides "Great": viz.: the Great Forest, the
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the "all-purpose"
use of the word _hrair_, or "thousands" by rabbits in Richard
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
It appears that Robotnik is "hijacking" the island by somehow
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
replaces the "real" Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
     "Fire Drill"
     Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
     Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
island.
     "Lord of the Floating Island"
     Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
     While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
Knuckles' exit line: "This is my island!  And I live to protect
and serve!"  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
     No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25  [Aug 1995]
     "Go Ahead...Mecha My Day" (the only story in this issue)
     Story: Mike Gallagher
     Art: Pat Spaziante
based on summary by James Firmiss
     In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a "zone portal."
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zone portal by kidnapping
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
terms: "Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice."
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
much of a bustline in issue #21!
     Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.


#26 [Sep 1995]
     "Way, Way Past Cool"
     Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
     Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
     This story has inspired renewed argument over species
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
expect?
     Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
would ordinarily avoid water?
     Fan art
     "Fortified"
     Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
     The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
forge.  Robotnik's "bus" crashes into the fort, only to confront
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
     FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in "Vol-Ant-eer" in Sonic #23
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
her a little on the "squashed" side.  After Spaziante's rendering
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
     SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of "total destruction" don't
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
Trouble special.

#27 [Oct 1995]
"A Scrambled Hedgehog"
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
     While retrieving a message in Robotropolis, Sonic collides
with a SWATbot with sufficient force to knock himself out. 
Coming to in Robotnik's headquarters, Sonic displays all the
symptom [singular] of that favorite condition of writers
everywhere: amnesia.  Robotnik passes himself off as Sonic mentor
and advisor.  After working out on some Freedom Fighter dummies
left over from the Princess Sally miniseries, and after having
had a microtransmitter planted on his person, Sonic is sent to
Knothole to "observe the underground terrorist group."  Sonic
enters a secret tunnel entrance to Knothole, but Rotor's security
system detects the bug.  Rotor tries everything he can to stop
Sonic before he can get out of the tunnel, but Sonic spins his
way out to the surface and enters Knothole, apparently under the
impression that his orders are to combat rather than observe.  To
be continued.
     At least the artwork didn't go schizo, switching from
Mawhinney to Manak halfway through.  Anyone else get the
reference to the Patrick McGoohan cult TV classic, "The
Prisoner," on page 3?
     Sonic Art: I know he's only 6, but Mitchell Resk's drawing
of Sonic makes him look like he's wearing a diaper.
     Triple Trouble Coming Attractions
     Gallagher/Manak
     Essentially a two-page ad for the upcoming issue.  Weirdest
panel is the one inviting readers to CHECK OUT PRINCESS SALLY IN
A HOT PINK STRING BIKINI, just before Sally nixes the idea.  And
this is the same Sally who went through the first season on TV
wearing nothing in the world but a pair of boots!  Apparently,
Gallagher is also Not Clear On The Concept when it comes to
clothing and furries.  Oh well, there are always the WEB site
pictures....
     Sonic Grams: PUH-LEEEZE lose the office humor; it's taking
up valuable space that could be used by "Noted From The Net"
[whatever happened to that idea?].  Recaps the contents of the
Triple Trouble issue, plus indicates that #28 will include the
preamble to the Tails miniseries.  Someone asks about Sonic's
sneakers; Robotnik gets a fan letter; and someone asks the names
of Sonic & Sally's offspring from #22.


Game Gear Adaptation #1 [Oct 1995]
Triple Trouble issue
     "Tttriple Tttrouble!!!"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
Robotnik miscalculates when trying to exploit a Chaos Emerald as
a power source, and the stone splits into two fragments.  One
half lands in the Great Forest where a new set of action zones is
created.  The other half lands on Knuckles' floating island where
it starts burrowing into a mountain.  Knuckles investigates but
is hit on the head by a rock and loses consciousness.  As for
Sonic, he enters the new zones to retrieve the shard, but as soon
as he does so he's knocked out by Knack the Weasel.  As for
Knuckles, he comes to in a cave surrounded by a group of Ancient
Walkers--cave-dwellers wearing masks.  After some exposition
about how if the half emerald should come in contact with the
Floating Island's emerald it'll blow the place apart, Knuckles is
returned to the surface in time to trash Knack, who happens to
have Sonic in the trunk of his vehicle.  Sonic & Knuckles start
to resume their old grudge match when Robotnik contacts Knack in
order to keep the plot moving.  Sonic & Knuckles reunite the
Emerald which disappears; they then part company after exchanging
insincerities and mutual distrust.  As for the emerald, it
reappears in the possession of the Ancient Walkers.
     "Submersible Rehearsal"
     Story: Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
Tails' joy as Rotor finishes work on The Sea Fox is punctured
when he learns that Sally has instructed Rotor not to put any oil
in the sub (fuel or lubricating? It doesn't say).  Tails then
learns that Robotnik has an octobot terrorizing sea creatures;
this information comes from an oil-soaked gull.  Draining the oil
from the gull to power the Sea Fox, Tails defeats the octobot and
destroys the underwater robot factory.  This is all prelude to
the Tails miniseries--a full-page ad shows Spaziante cover
designs, but we all remember what happened to the cover designs
for the Princess Sally miniseries, don't we?
     "First Contact"
     Story & Art: Ken Penders
Back on the floating island, Knuckles interrupts a tussle with
Vector to investigate what he thinks is a Robotnik invasion
attempt.  But it turns out he's being taunted (as in "Fire Drill"
in Sonic & Knuckles #1) by someone whose name turns out to be
Archimedes.  He leads Knuckles to the Chaos Chamber where he
tells Knuckles that "only when you can find me will we know that
you are capable of seeing the answer within the question."  The
solution promised in the upcoming Knuckles Chaotix issue.


#28 [Nov 1995]
"Saturday Noght's Alright For A Fight" [3 parts]
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
     Having penetrated into the Knothole control center, Sonic
basically begins beating up on everyone in sight.  This includes
the ladies--he puts Sally in a headlock, and escapes from a leg
scissors by Bunnie.  Eventually (by the end of Part 2) Sonic is
knocked out, the bug implanted on him discovered, he recovers
from his amnesia and the plot resolved.  
Sonic Art
"Growing Pains", Part 1
Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
     Tails is still upset at Sonic for having "slapped [him]
around" in the previous story, and resentful of Sally for keeping
the Sea Fox in dry dock as a "floating crib."  Thanks to the oil
he got from the gull in "Submersible Rehearsal" (the Triple
Trouble special), he sets out on his own.  Coming upon an
uncharted island, he comes to the rescue of Fiona, a captive
female fox, and instantly falls in love with her.  Fiona,
however, is an automaton set up as bait by Robotnik.  Tails is
trapped by Fiona, and Fiona herself starts the process of
roboticizing Tails [to be continued].
SonicGrams: More info about the Tails miniseries coming up --
apparently, the actions moves to "Downunda," the Mobian
equivalent of Australia; Freddy Mendez has moved on to other
editorial work within Archie Comics; two letters to Sonic elicit
replies about the Tails miniseries, and the information that
Sonic is 15; and one letter to Sally asks how to be a freedom
fighter (I think actually being on Mobius would be a plus).


#29 [Dec 1995]
     [Better double-bag this one, gang; it's a keeper for a
number of reasons.  DJD]
     Cover by Spaziante -- this stunning work alone deserves
recognition!  Not as powerful as the roboticization of Sally
sequence in "Sonic's Nightmare" but close enough.
     "Steel-belted Sally" (three parts)
     Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney
     After a one-page introduction to Dulcy (which was more than
she got when she debuted in the second season), we move on to the
story.  Sonic finds a "portable deroboticizer"(!!!) in a crashed
hover unit.  So Rotor takes it apart, figures out how it works,
begins mass-producing them, the residents of Mobius are
deroboticized and they drive Robotnik off the planet.  Wrong
answer!  Instead, Sally allows herself to be captured by Robotnik
and roboticized, trusting in a small disc that looks like a
battery for a calculator that's supposed to prevent her mind from
coming under Robotnik's influence after being roboticized. 
Unfortunately, the "neuro-overrider" falls off and Sally is
totally transformed.  As the others are on the verge of being
roboticized by Robo-Sally, Dulcy shows up and uses the portable
deroboticizer (remember THAT plot device?) to restore Sally and
foil Robotnik.
     Good artwork by Mawhinney, but readers have been quick to
point out the flaws in the plot of the story.  Why NOT use the
portable deroboticizer to restore Bunnie, or even Uncle Chuck
(scheduled to appear in issue #30)?  After it's used on Sally
it's never heard of again; shabby treatment for a pivotal device. 
And why wasn't the neuro-overrider more securely fastened to
Sally?  They couldn't find a bobby pin?  They never heard of
super glue?  They couldn't take the time to surgically implant
the thing?  And finally, whose idea was it at Archie Comics to
have Bunnie wearing metallic panties?  Her legion of fanboys are
glad she's putting in more of an appearance, but how about
keeping her on-model?
     Sonic Art: Reid Price's drawing of the girls elicited some
comment because of the tattoos and pierced ears.  Still a pale
imitation of the erotic "Bambioids" of Jerry Collins which are at
ftp://avatar.snc.edu/pub/furry/images/downloads/j/jc[001 through
108].gif.  Of this collection I am in awe.
     "Growing Pains, Part 2"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
     When we last left Tails, he had been betrayed by his new
girlfriend, Fiona, who turned out to be one of Robotnik's
automatons.  Tails has just been consigned to the desert island's
roboticizer.  Fasten your safety belts, return seats and tray
tables to their upright position and assume the crash landing
position: a promising story is about to go down in flames....
     The roboticizer explodes because of "fur from [Tails']
tails."  Wonder why this problem never came up when Robotnik was
roboticizing other furries; next time, Ivo, don't put your
prisoners in the air intake.  Fiona attacks Tails, who is then
almost crushed boa-style by one of Robotnik's palm trees.  Fiona
attacks again and attemps to drown Tails in the shallows. 
However, before she can finish the job she grinds to a halt. 
Apparently she is able to rust solid in a matter of seconds. 
Tails should have noticed this little problem when he and Fiona
were running along the beach during the romantic interlude on
page 5 of Part 1, but maybe Tails and Gallagher both learned
story structure and continuity from the same teacher.  While
Tails mourns his lost (or at least immobilized) love in
unbelievably heavy-handed prose, Robotnik escapes.  Tails may be
blue, but he's also green: he starts picking up the trash along
the beach.  This is how he discovers "absolute proof" that O.J.
Simpson murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman...oops, wrong
story.  What he discovers is "absolute proof" of a "satellite
operation functioning on the other side of Mobius."  Same level
of credibility, IMHO.  Having been handed the premise of his
miniseries on a silver plate without any connection whatever to
the two-parter he just endured, Tails is off on his solo
adventure.
     This isn't Shakespeare, Heaven only knows...it isn't even
Bacon, but Tails' acting in this story is 100% ham!  In writing
for comics you have to take shortcuts, and sometimes you have to
put massive amounts of plot development into a couple of word
balloons.  "Growing Pains", however, manages to wade through 15
pages before setting up the plot of the miniseries on the very
last page.  Which wouldn't be so unforgivable if the dialogue
that preceeded it weren't so extravagent.  "I'll put you here as
a monument to my lost youth...but I'll make him repair you and
we'll be together again, my love!"  Typical 10-year-old, right?  
     OK, when did you totally give up on this story?  I managed
to hang in until page 7.  When I got to the line "Robotnik
created the perfect woman, but forgot to waterproof her!", I knew
this was the cue for Sonic's line: "I think I shall hurl!"
     What galls me is the promise with which the story began. 
It's easy to tell the Trekkers in the audience because after Part
1 they've been rooting for Fiona to switch allegiances and join
up with Tails (call it the Mr. Data Effect).  The questions
raised by Part 1 were full of promise: Will Fiona cross over and
join the Freedom Fighters?  Did Tails get to second base with
Fiona during their romantic interlude?  The readers were ready to
grant Gallagher and Manak a lot of latitude in the beginning, but
the second part was a total bringdown.  The traps were
unbelievable, Fiona was written out of the story too easily, and
Tails was stuck with some of the most melodramatic lines this
side of Yiddish theater.  And by the last page you had the sense
of "Forget it, let's get on to the miniseries."  With more
thought to the story, "Growing Pains" could have been a decent
miniseries in its own right, ending with a Tails whose character
has actually grown by the end of the story.  It's a bad sign when
the readers take the story more seriously than the writer!
     Sonic Grams: For the last time, guys, LOSE THE OFFICE HUMOR! 
We buy the product so we can read about Sonic and Tails, not
Scott and Paul.  Buried in Scott's prose is the news that despite
the Spaziante covers, the team who perpetrated "Growing Pains",
Gallagher and Manak, will be doing the Tails miniseries!  So much
for anticipation.  Can you say "coherency?"  More important, can
you DO coherency?  November promises Sonic #30 and the return of
Uncle Chuck, Tails miniseries #2, and the Knuckles Chaotix
special, just in time for your holiday shopping.
     On to the letters themselves, and these stuck in my craw
even more than the flaws in "Growing Pains."  First they punt a
question on whether Tails is 5 or 10 years old, then they run a
letter to Dylan, then they casually mention that Antoine is 18
(without offering any proof that he's older than the rest), and
even though they go some ways in explaining the Boomer/Rotor name
game they have to deal with a question about Sonic and Robotnik
being half-sibs.  Two words: PUH-LEEEZE!


Tails Miniseries#1 [Dec 1995]
"Southern Crossover" -- Part 1
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     Who's that amusing himself with preadolescent delusions of
grandeur?  It's Tails, depicting himself as a comic book hero
[artwork by Gallagher] while continuing to nurse a grudge against
the older freedom fighters, and coming off more and more like an
obnoxious little ingrate (sorry, but his character's getting
REALLY disagreeable here!).  After some exposition for anyone who
missed "Growing Pains" Sally shows up; Tails hides his comic art
as well as the documentation that was the set-up for this
miniseries.  Sally tries to make Tails understand why the Sea Fox
wasn't filled with oil; Tails, still resentful, casts off at the
first opportunity.
     Meanwhile, Robotnik prepares his blimp to head for Southern
Mobius to supply his robo-underboss, Crocbot (I think Sonic would
appreciate the use of the word "blimp" in the same sentence as
"Robotnik" but anyway....).  We're made aware that Crocbot has
every intention of eventually overthrowing Robotnik and taking
over the whole shooting match himself, with the aid of his Wing
Dingoes (impressive bots, stupid name!).
     Tails, while out on the open sea, notices a shadow being
cast on the water by nothing -- it's the blimp, which has been
cloaked except for the underside; since the course of the blimp
would have taken it over the open seas, who knew?  Tails flies in
for a closer look but is zapped by two SWATbots.  He comes to
before hitting the water and created two water spouts to sink the
SWATbots.  When he tries to reboard the Sea Fox, who should be
waiting for him but the octobot from "Submersible Rehearsal"
[Triple Trouble special].  It trashes the Sea Fox and pulls Tails
underwater.
     Tails comes to and discovers that though he was on the verge
of drowning he was rescued by several underwater freedom
fighters: Bottlenose, a dolphin; Ray, a manta; P.B., a jellyfish
X-P; an unnamed giant clam; and Fluke, a blue whale.  With the
Sea Fox totalled, Fluke gives Tails a ride to Doununda.  To be
continued.
De-Tails (letters): Most noteworthy item was a response to a
question about Tails' parents: "You'll eventually find...out
[about Tails' parents] in Sonic's comic book."  It appears that a
Tails origin and/or reunion story is in the works.  


#30 [Jan 1996]
"The Return of Uncle Chuck"
Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Art Mawhinney
     After two pages of Sonic's reminiscing about Uncle Chuck, we
dive into the plot.  Robotnik and Snively are preparing to test a
"transdimensional transporter" [hereinafter "T2"], and are about to
use Uncle Chuck as a test subject.  Something goes wrong (though
John Johnston suggests in his review that Snively had this planned
all along) and Robotnik ends up trapped in the Void.  While Snively
goes off to show Robotnik how to properly crush a rebellion, there
is an unforseen consequence of the accident: Uncle Chuck regains
his consciousness and will.
     Quick cut to Uncle Chuck's deserted chili dog stand where
Sonic just happens to be mooning about Uncle Chuck, and where Uncle
Chuck just happens to pop up.  Before there can be a tearful
reunion, quick cut to Knothole some time later where Uncle Chuck
could apparently think of nothing better to do than whomp up a
batch of chili dogs for the gang before warning them about Snively. 
Uncle Chuck returns to Robotropolis, where he steals plans Snively
has drawn up to mount a T2 on the nose of an aircraft.  Sonic and
Uncle Chuck go after the plane, but Sonic is (for lack of a better
word) voided.  Snively, with Sonic held as a captive audience, then
wastes a sizable chunk of the Great Forest before he's shot at from
another aircraft, this one piloted by Uncle Chuck.  Snively is all
set to destroy the entire planet out of either spite or bad writing
when Robotnik drops in on him...literally.  Seems Uncle Chuck got
him out of the Void in some unspecified way [Can you say "Deus ex
machina?" I knew you could], and returned him to Mobius on
condition that Robotnik not harm the freedom fighters.  The cookout
resumes.
     This little story has some BIG problems, especially when
compared with the "Sonic Conversion" episode.  In the latter, Uncle
Chuck's "restoration" is not just an accident or the byproduct of
an accident.  His building of the holographic diarama of Mobius
helped establish his scientific credentials; in this story (as well
as the comics in general) he almost comes off as a glorified short-
order cook.  Worst of all, there is NO SPACE AT ALL devoted to
Sonic and Uncle Chuck's reunion despite so much set-up.  Any
emotional impact has been totally sacrificed.  IMHO, a comic
adaptation of "Sonic Conversion" would have been preferable; it
would have also given Mawhinney a chance to draw "the Bunnie bod"
in its entirety, though showing Bunnie in profile at the top of
page 8 is less than flattering.
     "Who Keeps Stealing My Chaos Emeralds?"
     Story: Paul Castiglia; Art: Pat Spaziante
     In order to further safeguard some Chaos Emeralds from a
thieving "anteater", Robotnik sends Coconuts to set some traps on
an island base.  The traps are pure Chuck Jones-Roadrunner stuff
(and Castiglia does nothing to hide the allusion) and Coconuts
comes off worse than the shadowy biped "anteater" who (it is
revealed in the last panel) is Bunnie, making her first appearance
as a Spaziante subject.  Except for some severe foreshortening of
her left arm, her depiction should please her fanboys; as for
keeping her "on model" [see discussion of #29], Spaziante literally
skirts the issue.

Knuckles' Chaotix #1 [n/d]
     "The Chaos Effect" (three parts)
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders; Art: Art Mawhinney
     After a nice one-page splash of Knuckles on the floating
island, we move on to the plot.  All the freedom fighters on
Mobius, it seems, have been invited to attend some sort of
amusement part on the island (which begs two important questions:
How did they get their invites?, and How did they get to the
island?).  The host, Renfield T. Rodent, escorts Sonic and the
Knothole gang into the hall of mirrors which is, of course, a
trap: everyone is sucked into an alternate dimension through the
mirrors except for Knuckles, and his abilities have been
compromised.  Three guesses who's behind it all, and the first
two don't count.
     Part 2 is basically an introduction to the Chaotix -- the
collective name for the 32-X game characters: Charmy Bee, Espio
Chameleon, Vector Crocodile, Mighty Armadillo, and the robots
Heavy and Bomb.  Perhaps the look was dictated by the game, but
Charmy, Espio and Mighty look way too much like Sonic wearing a
costume.  Anyway, armed with a cache of power gems, they prepare
to do battle.
     After starting all the amusement park rides at once to get
Robotnik's attention, the Chaotix find themselves up against
Mecha-Sonic.  Mecha-Sonic attempts to morph into a giant Hyper-
Knuckles, but the real Knuckles uses a power gem to even the odds.
In the ensuing clash of the titans, the mirrors in the Hall are
smashed and the freedom fighters released.  Robotnik makes his
escape, leaving Renfield to be arrested by some Muppets (I'm
sorry, but that's what they look like!).  Knuckles and the
Chaotix decline an offer to join the freedom fighters.
     Knuckles Art
     "Tag! You're It"
     Story: Ken Penders; Art: Harvo
     The members of the Chaotix play tag for 5 pages.  That's it.
Except for the appearance of some mysterious insect on the last
page, that's all there is to the plot!  If I were a tree, I'd be
insulted at being chopped down and pulped to yield the paper for
this!
     "The Hunt Is On!"
     Story and Art: Ken Penders:
     Looks like Archimedes is screwing around with Knuckles and
his friends again.  The Chaotix are captured by story's end as
Knuckles is taunted with the chioce of saving his friends or
saving his world.  To be continued.


Sonic #31  [Feb 1996]
     "A Robot Rides The Rails" (3 parts)
     Story and Art: Ken Penders
     This is Ken Penders' debut at drawing the Sonic characters,
and some fans have complained about the artwork, especially in
terms of modeling and facial expressions.  Still, Penders ends up
taking the reader on a pretty wild ride....
     Sally jumps a moving train carrying a Dynamac 3000,
Robotnik's latest creation.  On board, who should she run into
but Geoffrey St. John, who with some other commandos are
attempting to intercept Dynamac.  Their attempt to stop the
train, however, only awakens Dynamac.  Sonic is airlifted to the
train in time to witness Dynamac begin morphing.  Nicole informs
the group that Dynamac can adapt and react to attacks but cannot
anticipate; she also reveals how Dynamac can be deactivated.  It
takes a bit of doing, including Rotor flying interference in a
jet aircraft, but Dynamac gets blasted.  Sonic is none too
pleased with Geoffrey's farewell to Sally, and considers playing
the jealousy card himself.
     Whatever faults Penders may have as an artist (and these
could be smoothed out with practice), he's written a fairly
gripping action yarn, though in some ways it feels wrong.  More
suited to James Bond than Sonic the Hedgehog.  And Nicole's
"personality" is going off in a wrong direction as well.  Still,
an entertaining effort.
     "Lost and Found: Part 1"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Ken Penders
     This is supposed to be the beginning of the sequel to "The
Hunt Is On" from the Chaotix special.  It goes on for 2 pages. 
TWO LOUSY PAGES!  Except for a dropped clue [the words "Grand
Conserve"], this may as well have been an ad for the real
beginning of "Lost and Found" in Sonic #32!  What a waste!
     "Tundra Road: Part 1"
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Art Mawhinney
     Responding to a call for help from his mother(!!), Rotor
pilots his bathysphere (which looks like a submarine to me!) to
the Frozen North Sea [good thing he didn't think to ask Tails for
the use of the Sea Fox, since it was scuttled in Tails #1].  The
inclusion of an "audience participation" maze in one panel is a
dead giveaway that this story is being pitched to the rugrat
readership.  Rotor arrives home to find his Mom and little
brother Skeeter acting like zombies.  They and every other walrus
on the ice floe (why am I reminded of all those Far Side cartoons
that featured look-alike penguins?) proceed into an ice cave to
watch Robotnik on a big screen TV.  The Big Guy has abandoned his
plan to melt the polar caps, opting instead for a plan to freeze
all life on Mobius.  Rotor, not having been affected by a "neuron
bomb" that made the walrus herd susceptible to Robotnik's
broadcasts, tries to escape but is hit with a club by a SWATbot
and falls into the sea.  To be continued.
     Sonic-Grams: Dawn Spaziante, Pat's sister, is working at
Archie and puts in an appearance in the office humor section. 
Hey, Scott, I'm from Chicago -- you don't have to explain
nepotism to me!  Major news: Spaziante and Harvo will be tackling
a Knuckles miniseries, with story by Kanterovich and Penders.  In
order to accomodate them, the roll-out of the miniseries has been
delayed until April '96.  Isn't this kinda like what happened to
the Princess Sally miniseries?  Like Leo Durocher said, it's
*deja vu* all over again!  Two of the three letters concern
themselves with game matters; in response to the other, Sonic
only goes as far as admitting that he's "in like" with Sally, and
states that the guess that Archimedes is Knuckles' father is
"real close!"  Cute portrait of Sally on that page, BTW.

#32 [March 1996]
   Cover art: Pat Spaziante seems to be making his mark as a cover
artist, and a dynamic one at that.  And he continues to push the outside
of the envelope in his drawings of Sally.  Talk about a tail to
astonish....!
   "Blast From The Past" (3 parts)
   Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Art Mawhinney
The Knothole Freedom Fighters are somewhere in the mountains when
they're attacked by SWATbots.  One of them gets off a laser shot that
severs the rope that Sally has been climbing.  She begins to fall to her
doom....
   and this is just the first panel!  
   Tails catches Sally on the fly as the freedom fighters make
their escape.  However, they run into other SWATbots with a
robodog...which just happens to be Sonic's old pet, Muttski.  However,
the impending attack is broken off by Uncle Chuck using a device that
looks like a remote control for a toy car.  Antoine then tumbles into a
gorge where he discovers...  I'm sorry, but Mawhinney's talent totally
fails to make his rendition of a frozen prehistoric "Mobian bear" very
convincing--especially when compared with his rendition of a polar bear
later in this issue.  The two don't look anything alike.  The
prehistoric bear (dubbed "Mobie" by Tails) looks more like a hulked-out
version of that obnoxious animal from the Honeycomb cereal commercials
on TV (note to overseas readers who don't get American TV: you're not
missing a thing!).  Rotor suggests that they take Mobie back to Knothole
to revive him.
   Sonic accidentally causes a speedup in the thawing process and Mobie
promptly begins running amok.  Bunnie trees Mobie until he calms down.
Anti-Mobie sentiment begins to grow (Antoine: "He is ze librarian!"
Sally : "I think you mean 'barbarian,' Antoine."  Just for the record
I'M the librarian, and I have the Master's degree in library science to
prove it!  But enough about me....).  Bunnie, however, tries using
pictures to communicate with Mobie; since he was holding a paint brush
in one hand when he was found, she thinks he may have an artistic side.
Mobie takes one look at the group drawing of Bunnie's, has a dim memory
of his own family unit, and runs away from Knothole to look for them.
Sonic gives chase, reluctantly.
   Finding Mobie by a nearby mountain surrounded by SWATbots, Sonic
comes to his rescue.  Mobie returns the favor when Sonic manages to
knock himself out and almost gets chomped by Muttski.  Snoic has to do
some quick drawing in the dirt before Mobie tries taking Muttski apart.
The story is wrapped up in short order: Muttski's mind is restored and
Mobie is dropped off in a Mobian jungle.
   Pretty good action yarn hampered by an unbelievable "cave bear."  I
suppose by making bears the sapient species instead of primates,
evolution on Mobius took a different turn.  But I'll leave that to the
theoreticians on the list -- I'm a Mobian creationist myself ;-) .
   "Prisoners"
   Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders/Art: Ken Penders
   Yet another 2-page installment in the Chinese water torture that is
being passed off as a Knuckles story.  Espio, Charmy, Mighty and Vector
are trapped somewhere and encounter a shadowy figure wearing the same
digger-style hat as Knack the Weasel.
   "Tundra Road" Part 2
   Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
   We left Rotor sinking to his doom in the waters of the North Sea.
One other fan has summed up the situation best: we know Rotor will be
saved; the question is, will his rescue be as contrived as Tails' rescue
from the roboticizer in "Growing Pains, Part 2"?  As it turns out, Rotor
is indeed saved by two of the polar Mobians left over from "Way Way Past
Cool" (Sonic #26): Sealia the seal (who didn't have any lines the first
time but who has now acquired a copy of Antoine's dimestore French
accent) and Augustus the polar bear.  Using a literal Trojan horse
gambit, Rotor and the two polar Mobians invade the ice cave where the
walrus herd is still gathered, but Robotnik orders the brainwashed herd
to destroy Rotor.  The polar Mobians separate Rotor from the herd by
setting the herd adrift on an ice floe.  Rotor vows to return to release
the herd from Robotnik's influence...if the zombified herd doesn't die
of starvation in the meantime.  Oh well, at least Manak took a break
from doing the artwork.
   Sonic grams: same old office humor.  Hype for Super Sonic v.
Hyper-Knuckles special issue (story by Gallagher *ack!*/art by
Mawhinney).  One letter concerns Sonic's sneakers and there's some
teasing of Knuckles' story in issues 33-36.

Sonic #33 [April 1996]
     Cover art by Spaziante has Sonic up to his ankles and elbows
in...well, it sure LOOKS biological!
     "Let's Get Small" (in 3 parts)
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     WARNING: There's no way I can describe this story without
tipping Gallagher's hand and quoting some truly awful puns he's
worked into the script.  To compensate, I will be rating some of
the puns in the course of this review, using the following
guidelines:
     -         Bad
     --        Way Past Bad
     ---       I Think I Shall Hurl
     ----      A Capital Offence on Mobius
     So, on with the fun 'n' games.  Sonic returns to Knothole
from a patrol to find the place almost deserted.  It turns out
that everybody is laid up with a microbionic infection introduced
into their food supply by Robotnik.  Since he apparently placed
the bugs in an order of take-out fries, everyone has contacted
"the French Frirus" (--).  Rotor hangs in to give Sonic and the
reader the details before passing out.  Using a gizmo left over
from "Lizard of Odd" [Sonic #3], Sonic gives himself the title
treatment and we're off on yet another "Fantastic Voyage"
knockoff.
     Since Rotor has the decency to pass out with his mouth open,
Sonic travels down Rotor's gullet until he meets...ROTOR IN
DRAG!!  Seriously, he comes across a mini-Rotor wearing a print
dress, gaudy earrings, and 10 pounds of cotton on its head.  This
singular entity is called Rotor's "Auntie Bodies" (----).  Auntie
tells Sonic she's given up fighting against the French Frirus. 
Not willing to take this lying down, Sonic continues on only to
encounter exploding pustules which also speak with Antoine's
bogus accent: The French Foreign Lesions (----).  Where's the
French Anti-Defamation League when you really need them?  After
Sonic spins past them, he encounters the beret-wearing, equally-
accented "Paris-site" (---) who tries to cook Sonic using Fever
(an animate flame--you've seen 'em in cartoons a hundred times
before).  Sonic learns that he can't punch out a flame, but just
as he's about to get hit by the Paris-site's "microbe-bar" (-),
Auntie Bodies intervenes.  Emboldened by Sonic's "unselfish" [and
unspecified] act, she conks Paris-site while Sonic runs rings
around Fever and extinguishes him.  So now it's time for the
story's DEUS EX MACHINA: Rotor's Auntie Bodies uses a single-
celled cellular phone (--) [she should have used a T-cellular
phone!] to contact the Auntie Bodies in the other freedom
fighters.  Medicine by telepathy...or is that telephony, with a
capital PHONEY?  Anyway, the sharp of eye can enjoy images of
Sally, Tails, Bunnie and Antoine dressed like little old ladies
beating up on Paris-sites.  Where's the American Association of
Retired Persons when you really need them?  With Rotor on the
road to recovery, Sonic leaves Rotor only to realize that he's
too small to reach the controls of the miniaturizer/enlarger.  In
order to work the switch, Sonic jams himself up Rotor's nose (all
together now: EEEEEEEEW!!), causing him to sneeze Sonic onto the
controls.  Gallagher may think this is a credible turn of the
story, but it's snot (sorry, but Gallagher didn't use that joke
in the story and it was just lying around).  
     The last time I was down with the flu I felt like I'd been
hit by a truck.  Still, I also knew that in a week's time the flu
would just be a bad memory.  Gallagher, however, tells us nothing
about the French Frirus.  Is it potentially fatal or just a
disabling annoyance?  There's no way that a comic book aimed at
kids would entertain notions of the former, and if the latter is
the case then all Sonic has to do is wait for everyone to
recover.  In short, there's no story.  The character of Auntie
Bodies doesn't seem to be of much help; if she/it had been
threatened by Paris-site in some heinous fashion, you'd have the
makings of a Mobian equivalent to a serious immunodeficiency
condition.  Or would that be too close to reality?  The biggest
joke in this story, unfortunately, is its display of medical
knowledge.  Where's the Centers for Disease Control when you
really need them?
     There is, however, one redeeming feature to the story which
deserves a place in the Sonic canon.  No, it's not the sight of
Rotor in drag.  At the very end, Sonic prepares a batch of "my
Auntie's secret recipe for chicken soup."  Not only has such a
person as Sonic's aunt never been mentioned (does this mean Uncle
Chuck became a widower at some point?), but Rotor points out that
"it's made with chili dogs."  So that answers one of the long-
simmering (--) debates on the list: those chili dogs Sonic's been
scarfing all this time have been made with chicken franks!
     "The Big Picture"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Penders
     And now, an excerpt [sort of] from "Oliver Twist" by Charles
Dickens:

     The evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The
editor, in his checkered shirt, stationed himself at the desk;
his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the story was
served out....  The story disappeared; the boys whispered each
other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. 
Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with
misery.  He rose from the table; and advancing to the editor, the
two pages in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:
     "Please, Sir, I want some more."
     The editor was a dark, bearded man; but he turned very pale. 
He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some
seconds, and then clung for support to the desk.  The assistants
were paralyzed with wonder; the boys with fear.
     "What!" said the editor at length, with a faint voice.
     "Please, Sir," replied Oliver, "I want some more."
     The editor aimed a blow at Oliver's head with a rolled-up
Archie Digest; pinioned him in his arms; and shrieked aloud for
the beadle.
     The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Fulop
rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing he
gentleman in the high chair said,
     "Mr. Goldwater, I beg your pardon, Sir!  Oliver Twist has
asked for more!"
     There was a general start.  Horror was depicted on every
countenance.
     "For MORE!" said Mr. Goldwater.  "Compose yourself, Fulop,
and answer me directly.  Do I understand that he asked for more,
after having read the allotted two pages per month?"
     "He did, Sir," replied Fulop.
     "That boy will be hung...I know that boy will be hung."

     Oh, and some hooded figure in a multi-screened control room
is watching Knuckles and the Chaotix.  I wonder if anyone
remembers the plot, or even cares.
     "Sonic Shot"
     Story and Art: Ken Penders
     The Mobian Freedom Fighters are engaged in a game of ice
hockey when Snively shows up with some SWATbots to take on
Sonic's team.  Snively intends it to be a friendly game, and
insists he's there without Robotnik's knowledge.  Somehow,
Robotnik discovers this and uses it to his advantage, issuing a
winner-take-all challenge.  Sonic accepts and even though the
SWATbots play a very physical game against the Mobians, Sonic
makes a save at the net and scores the winning goal--so what else
is new?
     This story came out of nowhere -- to say that Snively's out
of character is to have a firm grasp of the obvious.  The reader
never knows how Robotnik is able to communicate with Sonic et
al., is there some kind of monitor at the rink (which had better
NOT be located in or near Knothole!), or what?  Robotnik doesn't
even sic the SWATbots on the Mobians after the match -- he only
SAYS he's a sore loser but doesn't prove it by his actions.  The
writing is flatter than a Zambonied ice rink; these Mighty Ducks
don't yield any mighty yucks.
     No Sonic Grams: only covers for the Super Sonic v. Hyper
Knuckles special, and Sonic #34 (which hints that Uncle Chuck
might be suffering a relapse).  Beyond that, there are 2.5 inches
of fine print stating circulation figures which still manages to
be more entertaining than the cartoons featuring Scott et al. 
Ron Bauerle, after analyzing the figures, expressed worry that
something like 2/3 of the shipped comics are returned to the
publisher by comic shops and so forth, but Paul Castiglia got on
the list to assure us that Sonic's sales and circulation numbers
are just fine, thanks.
     Not for long, if they keep on publishing magazines like #33. 
There really wasn't much to redeem this one.  Paul C. has
suggested that those of us on the list submit story ideas to
Scott Fulop for consideration, in the form of a single short
paragraph, three ideas per page.  Yet I fear that if someone
were, for instance, to submit the plot of Michael Szal's fanfic
"Nano-Wars" it would, by the time Archie got through with it, end
up reading like "Let's Get Small."  Still, in order to rescue the
mag from creeping lameness, maybe we'd better start coming up
with story ideas for them to work with.  Can't be too hard; look
at what got into this issue: knockoffs based (however loosely) on
two movies: "Fantastic Voyage" and "The Mighty Ducks."  Consult
Ratman's ftp site for Paul C.'s memo on submissions.
     In keeping with the rather psychedelic cover art, attention
should also be paid to the 1 page ad for the Sonic-Knuckles
special toward the back.  In the ad, a blue Sonic becomes a
yellow Super Sonic, and a red Knuckles becomes a magenta Hyper
Knuckles.  Their dance-like poses remind me of those colorful
dancing bears that are a part of Grateful Dead iconography. 
Actually, their colors also remind me of the uniforms worn by the
members of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  We're sorry,
but it's time to go.


Super Sonic V. Hyper Knuckles Special #1 [no date]
"Crash Of The Titans"
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Art Mawhinney
OK, kids, let's sing the theme song!
     They fight 
     And bite
     They fight and bite and fight
     Bite bite bite
     Fight fight fight
     The Itchy and Scratchy...oops...
     The Sonic and Knuckles Show!
What can you say about a story where the basic plot can be summed
up as: "Sonic and Knuckles try to beat each other up; after
finding a hidden level, they warp into Super Sonic and Hyper
Knuckles...and try to beat each other up"?  What can you say
about a story that features no less than TEN editorial box
comments by Scott Fulop?  My term paper should have as many
footnotes!  What can you say about a story like that?  Quite a
bit, actually.
     Sonic intercepts Knuckles just as the latter is approaching
an abandoned pond in sight of Robotropolis.  This pretty much
signals the beginning of round 1, though Sally shows up a short
time later once a tree gets uprooted in the fight: "When the
landscape starts to suffer, I step in."  Detectng radiation
reading using Nicole, Sally peers into the hole left by the
uprooted tree.  It's a classic missed opportunity for Sonic and
Knuckles, for they're so busy glaring at each other that they
don't seem to realize that they're in the perfect position to get
an eyeful of Acorn booty.  "Don't be shy, boys!  Take a look down
here!"  Indeed!
     I've voiced my opinion about Gallagher's jokey scripts in
the past; this time around, he largely keeps it in check.  He
also gives Sally an amazing aside totally out of left field which
I will NOT spoil.  The curious can read it on page 13.  Gallagher
may specialize in screwball gag writing, but apparently he can
throw a mean curve when he has to.
     Once in the zone, Sonic and Knuckles each collect enough
trinkets to power up and resume their fight.  In order to bring
this to an end, the two buttheads butt heads with sufficient
force that the zone collapses ("I felt a great disturbance in the
Force, Luke!").  Sonic comes to as Sally provides about a page of
exposition.  She also gives Sonic a ride home on a "sky-cycle"
though Scott's editorial box neatly conceals the view of Sonic's
hands around Sally's waist -- party pooper!  (Though from what I
can see of the placement of Sonic's left hand, it's either just
gesturing or else was drawn wrong and the box serves the purpose
of an artistic fig leaf.  Sonic's left hand should have been
obscured by Sally's back instead of blocking her right side.  I
know, I know: everybody's an art critic!).  Knuckles has to
settle for a spare Chaos Emerald as a consolation prize.
     The story, though minimal, is better than expected.  Perhaps
Gallagher needed Mawhinney's brilliant (as usual) art as a
steadying influence.  Some bad jokes that strain the fourth wall
(particularly Robotnik's cameo role), and Sonic and Knuckles seem
at times like they're trying to talk each other to death, but a
good combination on the whole.
     "Fathers and Sons"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders; Art: Ken Penders
     The story begins with a younger Knuckles being given a tour
of the island by his father, who sports a short beard and whose
white belted jacket means either that he and Luke Skywalker buy
their clothes from the same store, or else he operates a dojo on
the side.  Turns out, in mid-tour, we learn we're in mid-
flashback.  The words Knuckles heard his father use have been
quoted at him by Archimedes.  After another flashback concerning
Knuckles' problem-solving strategy (when in doubt, punch it out),
we learn that the island also has a Forbidden Zone and that this
was where Knuckles' father turned over guardianship of the island
before leaving his son.  I won't say how, exactly, but let's just
say that Knuckles' old man sure knows how to make an exit!
     VERY impressive layout on the top of page 7 and in the upper
left panels of page 8.  Though I prefer dialogue to soliloquy,
the latter was effectively used.  So it looks like, after months
of 2-page vamping, we're getting ready to get on with the
Knuckles story.
     P.S.: a 1-page ad displays the covers for Sonic #34 (is
Sonic being captured by Uncle Chuck?), and all three Knuckles
miniseries covers...as if the resumption of the Knuckles solo
story in #34 weren't enough.  If I were Knuckles, I'd ask for
more money!


#34  [May 1996]
     Spaziante cover.  Scott lets it be known, merely in passing,
that Spaziante has been the regular cover artist since #31.  Like
we couldn't have figured that out.
     "To Bot Or Not To Bot"
     Story: Angelo DeCesare; Art: Brian Thomas (debut)
     The story starts out with a jolt, as Uncle Chuck and Muttski
endure yet another failed attempt at being deroboticized. 
Meanwhile, the scene shifts to Robotropolis in a panel which (in
an echo of the opening credits of StH) reminds us that the city
is on the shore of a lake or bay.  Seems to me this is a useful
plot point, but anyway.  Robotnik has watched "Patton" once too
often and has assembled a troop of Combots, camouflaged soldier
bots with which he plans to attack the Great Forest.  Robotnik
loses the element of surprise, however, because Dulcy has
overheard his plans.  She doesn't repeat the message exactly
right but Sally gets the picture.  Sonic, Uncle Chuck and Muttski
return to Robotropolis to take out the Combots.  Once inside the
compound, however, Robotnik zaps Uncle Chuck and Muttski to bring
their minds back under his control.  Uncle Chuck arrests Sonic.
     The next morning, Tails, Bunnie and Antoine return from
patrol to report no sign of Sonic.  The three of them are wearing
the same black turtleneck sweater and knit stocking cap
combination they last wore in "That's The Spirit!" [Sonic #20] --
just the thing for late night commando operations or a casual
evening of stalking your ex-wife [Freedom Fighter outfits
provided by O.J.'s of Brentwood].  Sonic shows up soon enough --
lashed to the front of a tank Robotnik is driving at the head of
his Combots.  Very sadistic touch -- I LOVE IT!  Sally calls
retreat and has the freedom fighters abandon Knothole for an
underground shelter.  Unfortunately, Robotnik cuts them off. 
However, when Robotnik gives the Combots the order to flatten the
Great Forest, they malfunction by turning around and marching off
the nearest cliff.  At the same time Sonic has managed to escape
his bonds and has commandeered Robotnik's tank. Robotnik and
Snively beat a retreat in a hover craft driven by Uncle Chuck.
     Wha' hoppened?  Thanks to Rotor's exposition, we learn that
Rotor had fitted both Uncle Chuck and Muttski with neuro-
overriders -- the same electronic gizmos that DIDN'T work for
Sally in "Steel Belted Sally" [the infamous Sonic #29].  Amazing
what a drop of solder in the right place can do.  So while
pretending to be back under Robotnik's influence, Uncle Chuck was
able to reprogram the Combots and make sure that Sonic could
escape easily from being lashed to the tank.  It also helps
maintain his cover and gets him back in the spy business.
     Brian's artwork isn't seriously off-model, and his rendering
of Dulcy is especially dead-on.  Still, his rendering of the
Mobians (especially the females) has them looking a little too
cute.  No matter; welcome aboard, B.T.!
     A Sense of History, Part I
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Penders
     After months of two-page vamps, Kanterovich & Penders start
into the 3-parter prelude to the next Knuckles miniseries.  It
begins with a recap of echidnoid civilization:
     Once upon a time, the echidnas were the top of the Mobian
heap in terms of having an advanced civilization centered in
Echidnapolis, an island city surrounded by the Great River (once
again, for all their advances, they do have a knack for taking
only one adjective, "Great", and running it into the ground). 
Which would have been the fate of Echidnapolis if a couple
distant relatives of Knuckles hadn't determined that a white
comet was going to wipe out the city.  To avert this disaster,
the populace fanned out to gather together a dozen chaos emeralds
and place them in subterranean caverns beneath the city.  This
caused the island city to become a floating island, just in time.
Which was all well and good, according to Knuckles our narrator,
except that this somehow ties in with the creation of Mount Fate
and the appearance of a great menace.  To be continued.
     Was it worth the wait?  For me it was, but then again I'm a
sucker for a good origins story.  You get an idea of how many
hair styles an echidna is capable of, and there's a VERY nice use
of close-up at the top of page 6.  Aside from the fact that the
situation reminded me a little too much of the fate of the planet
Krypton (in a "What if..." sort of way), Kanterovich & Penders
have pulled it off.
     Sonic-Grams: I have a really hard time believing that kids
are writing to ask Scott Fulop to be a pen pal.  It's a little
like saying that, in the heyday of the New Yorker when they were
running cartoons by Thurber, that fan mail was coming in
addressed to Harold Ross!  Then again, recent communiques by Ken
Penders have spoken of Fulop almost as if he were the editor in
the past tense.  So perhaps the guard has changed and we haven't
been told yet.  Let's cut to the chase: Sonic #35 will attempt to
answer questions concerning Sonic and the power rings (the cover
art shows Sonic and what appear to be the masks of the Ancient
Walk-Ons...er, Walkers).  Bunnie fanboy alert: she's scheduled to
do a solo story in Sonic #37 (Rich Koslowski handling both script
and art) and will be a featured player in an upcoming two-parter
(script by Gallagher, art by Spaziante -- talk about your odd
couples!).  Espio will also be getting a solo shot.  Nathan Gropp
of Rochester, Indiana, wants to know if E.V.E. [Sonic #21] will
be coming back into the story; the response indicates that it all
depends on fan response.  OK, all you Fiona Fox fans out there,
you have your work cut out for you!


#35  [June 1996]
     "Ring of Truth," (in 3 parts)
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
     The story starts out in total game mode, with Sonic being
chased by Robotnik and losing his accumulated power rings along
the way (a situation to which I can, unfortunately, relate). 
While dodging Robotnik's maceball he grabs at a ring that causes
him to disappear.  Robotnik's onboard computer has been keeping
count of the number of rings Sonic has grabbed in the course of a
lifetime [how convenient!  Maybe Robotnik can find honest work as
a baseball statistician!] and it turns out that was the
1,000,000,000th power ring.  Never mind that, in the animated
series, Sonic can only access one ring a day.  We're dealing with
some different realities here.
     Sonic finds himself transported into another dimension,
where dwell the Ancient Walkers.  He is told that it is his
billionth ring and that his reward will be...knowledge.  Or a
copy of the home game, it depends.  Our hero finds himself
falling toward a green sea.  Turns out it's green because it's
made up, not of water, but of chaos emeralds.  The billionth
ring, following him around like a spaniel, breaks his fall.  A
second Walker, wearing a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament for no
particular reason, challenges Sonic to solve the Riddle of the
Rings.  Sonic guesses the answer and is buried by coiled chains
of power rings for his trouble.  Their accumulated weight drag
him down under the sea of emeralds where, rat-like, he is forced
to run on the inside of the aforementioned power ring.  He
confronts the third Walker who subjects him to one of the oldest
gags in the business.  There follows an entirely useless page of
Sonic trying unsuccessfully to make sense out of the preceding
eleven pages until, finally, he emerges back in his own
dimension, ring in hand, disabling Robotnik's hover unit in the
process.
     Gallagher gets major points for stretching, for writing a
story beyond the Sonic Vs. Robotnik And If You Have To Wonder Who
Will Win Then You Must Be New In Town genre.  Aside from the
small problems with this story (the billion ring business, the
"Playboy" pun that misfires), there's a more fundamental flaw. 
And since "Prof. Fulop" invited "scholarly" evaluations (in a box
on page 14) I humbly submit:
             A COMPARISON OF THE STRUCTURE OF "RING OF TRUTH"
                 WITH THE MESOPOTAMIAN "EPIC OF GILGAMESH"
     The Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates back to the first
millennium BCE, is a prototypical tale of a hero's quest.  "Ring
of Truth," on the other hand, deviates from the Gilgamesh model
in several important ways:
     In Gilgamesh, the hero at one point undertakes a quest. 
This quest has a purpose: to obtain a magic flower that will undo
the death of Gilgamesh's best friend, Enkidu, who died as a
result of their fighting against the Bull of Heaven.  Sonic,
however, stumbles upon the zone of the Ancient Walkers strictly
by accident.  He just happened to grab the requisite number of
rings.  It really doesn't count as a "quest" if it's accidental. 
The same weakness showed up in "Southern Crossover, Part 3,"
where Tails just has the events of Mobian prehistory channelled
through him to no obvious purpose or benefit.
     The second flaw in the story "Ring of Truth" involves
Sonic's inability to learn from what has happened (and to impart
said knowledge to the reader).  For Gilgamesh, his quest ends
when, having obtained the flower, it is taken from him by a
serpent and the god Utnapishtim delivers the punch line: that in
life there are no second chances.  By page 14 of "Ring of Truth,"
on the other hand, all we are left with is a metaphysical
mishmosh that gives Sonic a headache and which offers the reader
a number of meanings to choose from:
     A.   Yes!
     B.   This Isn't Fair!
     C.   Forty-Two!
     D.   Some Of The Above!
     It doesn't help matters that his "guides" on the path of
enlightenment are less than convincing.  Since their debut in
"Tttriple Tttrouble" [Game Gear Adaptation #1], the Ancient
Walkers have been saddled with the burden of Dave Manak's
artwork.  Our hedgehog hero is up against some heavy cosmic
stuff; Manak, however, manages to transform "cosmic" into
"comic."  His Walkers look like people wearing rather
unconvincing rubber dinosaur suits and masks that look like they
belong on the walls of Trader Vic's or some other tiki and
tropical drink bar.  Even Spaziante's sparse cover rendering of
the same masks cannot save them from looking, quite frankly,
ridiculous.  A little more thought in this story could have
prevented it from ending up as a lot of mystical sound and fury,
signifying nothing.
     "A Sense of History, Part 2"
     Story and Art: Ken Penders
     As Knuckles continues to flash back, it is now about four
generations after Echidnapolis went airborne thanks to the
installation of a dozen chaos emeralds.  Two echidna brothers,
Edmund and Dmitri, survey the chaos chamber where the emeralds
continue to radiate.  Their proposal to return the floating
island to the ground by means of a "chaos syphon" that would
gradually leach power from the stones, is sharply denied by the
scientific establishment who aren't in a mood to tamper with the
forces of nature.  Enraged by such narrowmindedness, Dmitri uses
the prototype of the syphon on the emeralds.  It succeeds in
reducing eleven of the twelve stones to charred shards and
transforms Dmitri into a being with "the energies of eleven
shattered chaos emeralds howling within him." [Note to Ken
Penders: Great line!]  Dmitri then either calls forth, or else
morphs into, Mount Fate.  To be continued.
     Now THIS is more like it!  If you're going to be mystical,
you can be linear about it as well.  So how exactly does echidna
civilization come to an end?  THAT'S what I call a tease.  This
just about makes me forget about all those 2-month vamps.
     Sonic-Grams, etc.:  The cover of #36 is interesting, not
just because Spaz has given us yet another tail shot of Sally,
but because she and Sonic apparently come face to helmet with one
of Sauron's Black Riders.  That's a High Concept plot for you:
Mobius meets Middle Earth!  I can only hope that this "quest"
isn't an ongoing excuse to put Sonic et al. in different settings
outside Mobius.  By me, it would be a tacit admission that the
writers had run dry and they couldn't come up with any more story
ideas involving the basic concept.  We'll know better next month.
     Great, Scott!  You're outta here!  Then again, Ken Penders
has spoken of you in the past tense for some time now, so the
move must've been a done deal by the time this went to press. 
Ken also said Scott quit to pursue some writing.  Let's see: he
contributed six editorial boxes to "Ring of Truth" and ten to
"Crash of the Titans."  So why am I not surprised that he wanted
to write?  Let's hope Fred Mendez does a better job of keeping
his ego in check.  Letters: a Canadian reader contributes a Sonic
rap and manages to finish each line without including the word
"Eh?".  The other letter (there are only two) asks if Knuckles
has hands inside his gloves [no, they're hooks, you little...let
us pause a moment to weep for this younger generation], and asks
whatever happened to the ABC series.  Scott shines him off by
blaming Robotnik's stranglehold on the mainstream media and by
saying that Sonic was too fast for the time slot.  OK, I'm also
disappointed that he didn't advise the kid to read my FAQ File. 
Maybe Fred knows enough to credit the computer-literate among the
readership.  Heck, you ever count how many commercials are now
featuring the addresses of Web pages?  Our day will come, Cyber-
Mobians!

     
#36 [July 1996]
     Spaziante cover art -- the castle and carved gates don't
figure into the story, but who cares?  Another masterpiece.
     Heart of Darkness (3 parts)
     Story: Ken Penders; Art: Art Mawhinney
     HOYOTOHO!
     No, Rotor hasn't tuned into Bayreuth to watch the Flight of
the Valkyrie.  What he DOES have is a "live" remote from the
"Zone of Silence."  Isn't that the same thing as "The Void"? 
After about 5 panels of explanation, some of the readers of this
list still seem uncertain on this point.  All I know is, it bears
no resemblance to the Void featured in the TV ep of the same
name.  In any event, the fact that it isn't the Void is offered
up by Rotor as a way of explaining why previous attempts to
travel there and back again were so easy.  But in a more
important complication, there are serious power reading coming
from Robotropolis.  Sonic goes to investigate, and arrives to
find Snively at the controls of some kind of beam generator which
reminds me too much of the climax of "All Good Things...", the
final ep of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" (now that Ken
Penders has revealed himself to have worked on Star Trek comics
I'm keeping my copy of the _Star Trek Encyclopedia_ close at hand
to check for references, though the STE as a reference work
suffers from flaws that range from annoying to unforgivable.  But
I digress...).  Sonic arrives and takes the device out of
commission, and Robotnik congratulates him on endangering all of
Mobius.  Cue the flashback for Sonic's (and our) benefit: Seems
that when Robotnik took over eleven years ago, he wanted to use
the Zone of Silence developed by his "mentor" Kodos as a sort of
interdimensional concentration camp.  Unfortunately, once he sent
King Acorn there he realized that it was unstable and would
absorb Mobius.  Subjecting the thing to a steady stream from a
photon cannon managed to keep it in check, but with the cannon
destroyed by Sonic alternative measures have to be taken. 
Robotnik gives Sonic an "energy inhibitor" which bears a striking
resemblance to a household bug bomb.  He convinces Sonic to
detonate it within the Zone; despite serious reservations, Sonic,
Sally, Tails, and Antoine enter the Zone, which basically looks
like Space, The Final Frontier(tm).  There, they confront the
dark rider flanked by some characters who look like they belong
in a game of Doom.  Sonic dispatches these bit players, but
before the rider/knight/whatever can draw a bead on Sonic, Sally
intervenes.  In the struggle, she knocks off his helmet and
reveals him to be...what the heck, someone of the list has
already spilled the beans...King Acorn!!!  Or a reasonable
facsimile thereof.  Actually, he's not that reasonable, for he
gives Sally a quick jolt with his lance for her troubles.  In
response, Sonic detonates the bug bomb -- don't ask me what the
practical results were because they're never spelled out.  Rotor
manages to drag the Mobians back through the portal before they
overshoot it, and a shaken and subdued Sally is probably thinking
that now she knows how Luke Skywalker must have felt at the
end of "The Empire Strikes Back."  To be continued, somewhere
along the way.
     And to think it was only three issues ago that we were
witnesses to some of the lamest excuses for storytelling ever,
even for the medium of comic books.  The improvement, both in
terms of complexity and emotional impact, has been quantum. 
Major kudos for both artwork and story.
     So, does anyone besides me think that that WASN'T Sally's
father wearing that armor?  Not only did the Zone bear no
resemblance to the Void, but in the two TV eps where Sally and
her father were reunited ["Blast To The Past, Part 1" and "The
Void"] Sally's father didn't fail to recognize her.  That didn't
happen this time, which makes it all just a little too
unconvincing.  I'm also haunted by Robotnik's aside on page 9
about Sonic doing his "dirty work" for him.  It leaves me with
the strong impression that Robotnik knew precisely what effect
the bug bomb would have in the Zone.  So the question remains:
whom did Sonic destroy?  Possible candidates:
     A. the real King Acorn
     B. Kodos as King Acorn
     C. a parallel King Acorn (cf. "Night of a Thousand Sonics")
     D. None of the above
And judging from the effects of the bug bomb in the Zone, I feel
pretty safe in saying that whoever it was was destroyed when it
detonated.  Which has major consequences from Sally's point of
view: can she really feel close to the hedgehog who (she may
believe) assassinated her father?  I don't envy Ken Penders his
job: this story's opened some major pitfalls and trap doors, and
it's his burden to resolve matters plausibly (unlike the
conclusion to "Growing Pains").  Stay tuned; you can bet I will!
     "A Sense of History: Part 3"
     Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders/Art: Ken Penders
     No wonder Ken P. has been waiting for this review!  Let's
recap the story to date: Dmitri has just used the "chaos siphon"
to trash eleven of the 12 Chaos Emeralds that hold up the
floating island.  He has taken his brother and some of the
leaders of echidna society prisoner.  He has already directed the
resident "mecha-nauts" to enslave the populace, and once the
island is equipped with sails he plans to similarly conquer the
rest of the planet.  In the midst of this raving, however, it
develops that his fortress Mt. Fate has been subverted from
within: the foundation has been eroded by fire ants and the place
starts collapsing.  The imprisoned echidnas escape and Dmitri is
buried beneath the rubble.  The Magistrate gratuitously quotes
from the Book of Proverbs and declares that Dmitri's end was as
much a result of the society's trust in science resulting in
hubris as it was Dmitri's own madness.  This led to a certain
overreaction as the echidnas destroyed their city and appointed a
guardian over the last remaining emerald.  Which, several
generations later, turns out to be Knuckles.
     So what's this all have to do with the plot?  (Remember the
plot?)  Knuckles suddenly starts putting it together: he
remembers the words "Grand Conserve" from issue #31(!) and
realizes that it refers to The Grand Conservatory, an underground
warehouse where artifacts of echidna society were stored.  He
believes that this is where Archimedes (remember him?) is hiding
out and where the missing Chaotix (remember them?) are being
held.  So, as Bill Cosby said in the course of one of his comedy
routines: "I told you that story to tell you this one."  And once
more quoting his father (who was apparently named George
Santayana) he reminds us of the plot and begins his segue to his
miniseries (conveniently advertised on the facing page).
     WHEW!  I know that this process took longer than
anticipated, what with the addition of three 2-pagers over the
course of three months, but Kanterovich & Penders came pretty
darn close to losing the audience there.  In any event, the ad
for the miniseries pretty well telegraphs the plot based on what
went before: Dmitri vs. Knuckles.  BTW, I wouldn't make too much
of the movie poster format.
     Sonic-Grams: Who was it that said "We buy the product so we
can read about Sonic and Tails, not Scott and Paul."  Oh, yeah,
it was me...in my review of #29.  Nice to know the Fredster is
willing to listen; by keeping the Blue Blur front and center in
the "office humor" section [drawn by Spaziante] he actually
managed to come up with something funny!  Senor Mendez limits
himself to less than 2 column inches of self-introduction before
going on to "what you really want to know: mainly Sonic the
Hedgehog!"  [By George, I think he's got it!]  Topics: the launch
of the Knuckles miniseries; a story titled "The Fall of
Robotropolis" by DeCesare and Thomas (after his debut in "To Bot
or Not To Bot" in #34); plus further developments on the King
Acorn plot set up by "Heart of Darkness."  Letters: Kim Wessels
of Des Moines agrees with Tails that it's rough being treated
like a kid.  In answer to a barrage of questions, the person
writing the replies pegs the birthdates of Sonic, Tails, and
Knuckles to the release dates of the Sonic 1, 2 and 3 games
respectively.  However, he punts the question as to whether the
TV series is still on the air -- this reply must have been locked
in months ago, before the USA Network picked up Sonic's option. 
And in a major concession to the comic's popularity, there's a
list of people who sent in letters and fan art that didn't get
published but who still might love seeing their names in print. 
Fred, I like your style!
     Spaziante cover art for #37 shows Sonic holding a
(lifeless?) Sally in his arms.  Is it possible for Spaziante NOT
to do a cool cover that involves Sally?  Looks like the train is
definitely back on the rails!  Double-bag this puppy!

#37 [Aug 1996]
   I'm getting tired of these covers by Spaziante...NOT!!!  Sonic
in freefall (apparently) holding Sally in his arm.  Nice design -
- call it "The Mobian Pieta."  And if you don't know what I'm
talking about, get thee to a library and read up on the
sculptures of Michelangelo [the sculptor, not the turtle!].
   "The Day Robotropolis Fell"
   Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Brian Thomas
   Sonic and Sally rendezvous with Uncle Chuck in Robotropolis,
who breaks the news to them that Robotnik has predicted that an
earthquake is going to hit the city (Excuse me, Dr. Robotnik,
some gentlemen from Cal Tech have just arrived; they keep talking
about "the big one" so I assume they mean you...).  Robotnik's
plan is to hover over the city in a giant saucer-like craft
loaded with his SWATbots until the quake ends.  He doesn't
particularly care what happens to the worker bots (i.e.,
roboticized Mobians) but Uncle Chuck does.  Uncle Chuck's plan:
while Robotnik is hovering, they enter his HQ, reactivate the
deroboticizer (gee, that's the first I've heard of it!) and treat
as many worker bots as possible before the quake hits.  This
assumes what Uncle Chuck doesn't: that Robotnik left a
comfortable margin between takeoff and the quake.  Unable to
deroboticize the Mobians one at a time, he plans to blow up the
roboticizer by overloading it, counting on the diffusion to
deroboticize the Mobians in bulk, as it were.  Sounds to me like
the scientific equivalent of supply-side economics, but never
mind.  In the resulting blast, Uncle Chuck is NOT effected while
the rest of the worker bots are.  Uncle Chuck and DeCesare don't
bother to explain how this could have happened before the next
tremor comes down the pike.  Rotor just happens to arrive with a
transport plane, but it proves to be too small.  Sally pulls rank
and orders Uncle Chuck onto the plane -- OK, so it's not exactly
the airport scene from "Casablanca."  While Sally tries to find
out from Nicole what's the best way out of Robotropolis during an
earthquake, a sizable chunk of masonry lands on top of her.  If
this weren't a comic book, she'd be a stain on the pavement; as
it is, she's unconscious and it's up to Sonic to get her out of
town.  They manage, and we eventually see Sally with her head
bandaged and her arm in a sling.  Robotnik lands and resolves to
rebuild, relying on a satellite-based force field to protect the
city during its reconstruction.
     I'll leave it to the Californians on the list as to whether
DeCesare's depiction of a quake is credible; me, I had enough
troubles with this story.  Uncle Chuck is suffering from a bad
case of logic deficiency in this one: the business with the
deroboticizer--It will be most effective if I overload it to the
point of destroying it--reminds me too much of some of the plot
problems with "Steel-Belted Sally" (#29).  There's no way ALL of
the roboticized Mobians could have converged on the deroboticizer
just in time for the explosion so some of them had to have been
victims of the quake, just as there's no way Sally could have
avoided becoming a blob of royal jelly after that masonry fell on
her.  Nor do we ever find out how Uncle Chuck escaped the effects
of the deroboticizer, or how Rotor was able to get a plane from
Deus Ex Machina Airlines into the city in time.  The premise of
the story was good, as was the artwork, but the more you think
about the plot the more it turns into a no-brainer.
     Sonic Art: I thought Brian Thomas had drawn the eyes of the
characters in "The Day Robotropolis Fell" too big--Sally
especially looked as if she belonged in a black velvet painting--
until I saw Charles Kusiak's fanart.  You could drive a TRUCK
through those pupils!
     Bunnie's Worst Nightmare
     Story and Art: Rich Koslowski[debut]
     Bunnie's first solo effort starts out with quite a premise:
What starts out as an annoying itch turns out to be a spreading
case of roboticization.  Thanks to a convenient hologram of
Robotnik to describe the plot, it turns out that Bunnie may have
been partially roboticized at one time, but a "microscopic
device" implant has started to finish the job.  On the verge of
total roboticization, she leaves Knothole.  After traveling all
night she falls asleep and wakes up to...The Old Dream Ending!
     It's a pity Rich was only given 8 pages to play with; with
another 8 pages, this could have been the story it was meant to
be.  It's not that this ground hasn't been travelled before: it
has, in everything from "The Amazing Colossal Man" to "Dr.
Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde" to the remake of "The Fly": what it's like
for someone to gradually lose their humanity (or in Bunnie's
case, to borrow a word from Richard Adams, her "animality") while
becoming something else.  If you'll allow me, here's how it could
have played:
     At first Bunnie ignores the first signs of change, though
she may even have a suspicion as to what it may mean.  This
proves the saying heard in 12 Step groups: Denial ain't just a
river in Egypt!  Then the condition continues its slow,
relentless possession of her.  I think it wouldn't be too strong
to say that, from Bunnie's point of view, this gradual takeover
of her bod must feel like slow-motion rape.  An off-hand remark
from one of her friends (spoken in innocence by Tails or in
ignorance by Antoine) lets the reader know that she's not just
turning into a machine but also into one of Robotnik's minions. 
After the obligatory note scene, she starts to leave Knothole but
is intercepted by Sally who tries one last time to talk her into
staying.  After a tearful farewell, Bunnie begins to leave, then
pauses.  Sally, ever hopeful, runs over to her, only to discover
that Bunnie's transformation is complete and that she's gone over
to the Dark Side, as it were.  She now has a new set of
priorities, the first of which is: "DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY
ORDER OF ROBOTNIK."  
     I'm not trying to brag, but I barely broke a sweat coming up
with this enhancement to the story line.  Yet I also couldn't
help but think of (if you'll allow me to get momentarily off-
topic) an episode of Disney's "Aladdin."  In this one ep, Jasmine
begins turning into a kind of serpent creature due to a spell by
Mirage, an evil being.  She and Al journey in search of a
possible cure.  When all attempts to get at the cure are foiled
by Mirage and Jasmine's transformation into a monster is
complete, Al takes it upon himself to become the same kind of
creature as she has become, for the sake of love.
     I mention this because while Rich does a good job of showing
what is happening--the plot certainly moves right along--there's
not much room in the story for all but the most superficial
treatment of Bunnie's emotional state.  Her emotional landscape
is painted only in the broadest strokes; this was the fatal flaw
that made Tails' change of heart at the end of "Southern
Crossover" [Tails miniseries #3] patently unbelievable.  Perhaps
this goes back to the question of the core audience of the comic,
but the Aladdin ep mentioned above demonstrates that it is
possible to tell such a story without dumbing it down
emotionally.  I look upon this story as eight pages of "what
might have been."  As glad as I am to see Bunnie getting a solo
shot, I really believe she deserved better.
     Sonic-Grams: hint that the theme of a devastated
Robotropolis will continue and that Sonic will become a slow-mo. 
Plug for Knuckles #2, and a hint that Sonic will finally have a
date with the Roboticizer in #39.  Cute depiction of Joe Pepitone
as Robotnik and Fred Mendez as a computer program.  Lyrics to a
Sonic song, and a couple guesses as to the identity of
Archimedes, with an actual answer!  Almost a full page of names
of readers who have written--major headache!

Will attempts to post further synopses and FAQs to the home page
whereon the Faq File resides.  Otherwise, I may actually have to
(dare I say it?) SPEND MONEY for a computer and a subscription to
CompuServe or AOL!  My current machine at home -- an XT vanilla
clone I got as a castoff from my brother-in-law -- can no longer
read its own hard drive.  And my lunch hour at work is just
about...

#38 [Sept 1996]
   Spaziante/Harvo cover: Sonic is harvesting a power ring when
he's spotted by a squad of ComBots.  Don't you hate when that
happens?
   "The Rise of Robotropolis--the Fall of Sonic"
   Story: Kent Taylor[debut]/Art: Manny Galan[debut]
   And welcome to Amateur Hour, Sonic fans!  Seriously, Ken
Penders has been forthright about downsizing in the funny book
industry.  Will Kent and Manny prove to be as formidable as
Gallagher and Manak?  Let me rephrase that....
   Our story opens with some slightly off-model characters, an
armload of exposition from Tails, an interesting POV, and Antoine
uncharacteristically wielding a broadsword (with no shield,
armor, or even a scabbard).  Although in this weather (a nice
touch, by the way), it might be more accurate to say he's
wielding a lightning rod.  It turns out Tails, Antoine and Sonic
are reconning Robotropolis after the earthquake, but for all
practical purposes the quake never happened; the city looks as
menacing and run-down as ever.  So you can forget the plotline
from "The Day Robotropolis Fell" since it's not really necessary
for this story.  Anyway, the gang come upon some ComBots left
over from "To Bot Or Not To Bot" [#34].  Tails airlifts Antoine
out of harm's way only to drop him on top of a couple of ComBots
in what Taylor calls an "atomic drop."  This maneuver bears no
resemblance to the professional wrestling move of the same name,
but hey, if Sonic can drop-kick a ComBot in the crotch (page 3)
while calling it a "drop-kick to the chest" who am I to say? 
Anyway, remember what I said about Antoine's sword being a
possible lightning rod?  Well, one of the ComBots is struck by
lightning; the resulting explosion, however, knocks Sonic out
cold.  Fearing the worst (because Sonic's got those stupid X's in
his eyes that hint that maybe a cartoon character has gone to
That Big Inkwell In The Sky), a fearful, tearful Tails (with an
achey breaky heart?) flies off to get help.  He returns with the
rest of the gang; the storm is over and Sonic is coming to. 
Unfortunately, he seems to have been slowed down by the
explosion; Rotor's explanation of how this happened is so full of
technobabble that I'm not about to boil it down.  Nicole suggests
multiple power rings as a possible cure for his condition.  On
their way back to Knothole to implement this suggestion, the
group is ambushed by cloaked ComBots.  Everyone is captured
except for Sonic, who manages to avoid yet another exploding
ComBot by jumping into the pool where the Power Rings are
generated.  Give Taylor credit for doing his homework by reading
the character sheet on Sonic; he knows that the blue dude can't
swim.  He's rescued from drowning by...HOWARD THE DUCK WEARING
FALSE EYELASHES!  No, it's only Penelope Platypus from the
Princess Sally Miniseries.  The rest of that group apparently saw
the battle on a "SPY CAM" courtesy of Deus Ex Machina Photo
Equipment.  With guest star backup and one power ring, Sonic is
going to attempt a rescue.  Sonic links up with the two canine
operatives from the opening scene of "A Scrambled Hedgehog" [#27]
and an extremely improbably fly-creature.  Sonic's nerves are
getting a little raw without his speed advantage but he and the
others follow the spy underground's instructions and enter...if
you said "one of Robotnik's traps" you must have read ahead.  So
now what?  Now it's time to strain the law of averages to the
limit: Sonic is holding onto one power ring, and he suddenly
remembers he has a spare in the backpack he's been wearing (and
it only took him 7 pages to remember) AND he just happens to see
another power ring embedded in the torso of the ComBot which blew
up on page 9 and which just happens to be undergoing repairs in
the same room!  And Robotnik doesn't even seem to have noticed
the power ring!  Gee, what are the odds?  Sonic manages to
collect all three and, reprising the theme song from "Sonic the
Hedgehog" that he started singing at the beginning of this story,
he makes short work of the ComBots while allowing Robotnik to
make one of his patented Escapes Leaving Our Heroes In Peril
Which They Escape Anyway.
     Story-wise, it's simple enough: Can Sonic get over being
just another slow-mo?  It's a good premise, but in order for the
story to keep moving there are so many coincidences that it
begins to look positively Dickensian after a while.  The storm
was a nice touch, and necessary to the plot, but was over as soon
as it wasn't needed.  Bunnie, Sally and Rotor manage to arrive
just as Sonic's injury proves non-life threatening -- wouldn't it
have made just as much sense for Tails to airlift Sonic?  After
all, he did the same for Antoine a few panels earlier.  There
must have been cloaked ComBots all over the Great Forest for the
gang to run into them.  And once again, NOTHING in this plot
really hinges on the earthquake that was supposed to have
happened in the previous issue; with the most minor of changes,
this story could have run six months ago!  Remember my saying
that Brian Thomas's artwork in "To Bot Or Not..." made the
characters a little too cute?  Manny Galan seems to be having the
opposite problem: while his characters aren't seriously off-
model, they do look...how can I put this...gangly.  Bunnie
especially; the pictures of her on page 6 make me think she's
going to try out for the NBA (I'll bet those metal feet would be
murder on hardwood floors).  And as much as I like Manny's use of
differing points of view when drawing, some of the panels seem to
use interesting POV just because it's there.  The overhead shot
on page 11 is a legit use; the POV in the last panel on page 7 is
just confusing and pointless.  And be very afraid of the picture
of an infant Sonic on page 7!  Sure, it seems like a throwaway
bit that's stuck in as part of a larger, and largely unrelated,
story.  But that's how the Muppet Babies(R) got started!  Beware!
Anyway, it's a worthy first effort for Kent and Manny; the former
needs to think his plots through and the latter needs to watch
the tendency to play visual tricks at the expense of clarity. 
Like this kind of criticism will make any difference; Archie's
already got Sonic comics planned out for the next year at least.
   "Bedtime Tails"
   "A scintillating saga of triumph and tragedy crafted with care
in the mighty Mobius manner by Mike Kanterovich & Ken Penders,
with John D'Agostino, Vickie Williams & Barry Grossman"  [Note: I
have reproduced this drivel in full because it seems all five
parties involved want to avoid taking specific credit/blame for
the following.  With reason.  Let's see: Mike and Ken had to have
written it, I'm guessing Ken did the art while D'Ag did the
inking, with Vickie and Barry handling the lettering and coloring
respectively.  How'd I do?]
   Sonic has taken to bed with a cold, and watching daytime TV is
only making things worse.  Taking a cue from both "Tails'
Knighttime Story" [#22] and "Southern Crossover" [the Tails
miniseries], Tails shows up to subject Sonic to comics that he's
written and drawn himself.  To his credit, Tails has moved away
from the preadolescent egotism of "Tails To Astonish" but his
artwork has slipped a couple notches.  What, Gallagher didn't
want to get in on the fun?  We start out with a Fantastic Four
parody (for want of a better word) starring Sonic, Sally, Tails
and Rotor.  The set-up manages to combine elements of the sublime
(James Thurber's "Secret Life of Walter Mitty") with the
ridiculous (the theme from "Gilligan's Island").  It's a pretty
lame comic, since of the four "superheroes" only Sonic
demonstrates anything like a super power -- Tails doesn't even
FLY except on the cover art!  If you're waiting for Sal to go
invisible or Rotor to hulk out, forget it!  I won't even bother
with the hackneyed plot concerning a giant alien named Robotnicus
and the stupid way he's defeated.  Suffice it to say that the
comic's so dull it puts Sonic to sleep.  Turnabout being fair
play, when Sonic recovers and Tails is under the weather, Sonic
cranks out an issue of "Bat-Sonic" to read to the kid.  We are
mercifully spared the adventure of the "dark and stormy knight." 
Though the logo on the cover says it was published by "Sonic
Comics" I'd have guessed it was published by Deja Vu Comics,
since Bat-Sonic put in an appearance during "Night of a Thousand
Sonics" [#19].  The covers of both comics are reproduced on one
full page each; what, they ran out of fan art this issue?
     In the words of a certain animated non-role model who wears
an AC-DC t-shirt and thinks that nachos rule: "What the hell is
THIS crap?"  The modeling for Tails is way past off (though Sally
manages to look gorgeous in spandex), and the writing is simply
slap-dash.  This reads like something that was thrown together to
take up space at the last minute because everyone involved was so
busy concentrating on stuff like the Knuckles miniseries or the
upcoming Mecha Madness issue.
   The worst part of it is, I actually LIKED the idea of a
Fantastic Four treatment of the Knothole gang and was
disappointed that so little of substance was done with it.  But
the Gang of Five (Mike, Ken et al.) should have taken it to the
next level.  Look into your heart of hearts.  What we should have
been given, "in the mighty Mobius manner," was a comic adaptation of:

                   THE MIGHTY MORPHIN' FREEDOM FIGHTERS

C'mon, it practically writes itself: Sonic as the Blue Ranger,
Sally as the Pink Ranger, Bunnie as the Yellow Ranger (because
it's her color), Tails as the Black Ranger (because it's his
comic!), Rotor as the Green Ranger, and Antoine as that twerpy
droid running around yelling "Sacre bleu cheeze!" (which is
French for: "Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!").  What'd ya expect, Antoine as the
White Ranger?  And how about Robotnik with Rita hair?  King Acorn
as that giant floating holographic head?  And lest anyone
misunderstand, I HATE the M.M.P.R. if for no other reason than
they clobbered Sonic in the Sat AM ratings and prevented the
third season from happening.  It would serve them right!  I
haven't seen a story this lame since "Sonic Shot" [#33].
[[Exclusive to Ron B: Ken Penders has since explained that a) the
verbiage in the credits box was a send-up of the way Marvel used to do
it -- I was never into Marvel in its heyday so what did I know; b) this
story had been written for inclusion in, like, Sonic #19 but got
shelved, which might explain the earlier, lighter tone; c) Sega suits
nixed a drawing of a Sonic Power Ranger from "Night of a Thousand
Sonics" and pretty much banned any references to MMPR.  OK, but I STILL
wanted to see Sally become invisible!]]
   Sonic Grams: The office humor strip: twice the humor of the
old (Scott Fulop) strip in only half the space!  It would appear
Spaziante was put onto the Mecha Madness issue with the result
that Art Mawhinney did the art for the Knuckles miniseries (which
has NOT shown up on local newsstands -- that's why I sent away
for the whole series).  Fred also indicates that due to popular
demand, the Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters and the Chaotix have
stories in the Mecha Madness issue.
   Letters: Evelynne Pine puts her $.02 in about the romantic
triangle in "A Robot Rides The Rails" [#31].  Ken Bluma mentions
a "Look and Find" book featuring Sonic and illustrated by Art
Mawhinney -- THAT I'd like to get!  Fred punts an age question,
stating that Sally's 14(!) and Antoine's 18(!!!).  Then there's
the "Find Your Name In Print" page, which Dmitry Muraschik calls
"'Where's Waldo?' with letters".  And Archie is running ads for
its Hanna-Barbera comics line, including "Scooby-Doo!"  You
should read what they're saying about him on rec.arts.animation:
Scooby's been called the Beast from Revelation [take it from a
theology major, that's NOT a compliment] and Shaggy's been
accused of being a doper.  I rather like the comment that the
show is "the animated equivalent of Spam."  Zoink!

Sonic #39 [Oct 1996]
     Spaz/Harvo cover: "Mecha Madness begins here."  Personally I can't 
understand why Mecha-Sonic has the fan following that he appears to have.  
Still, he's getting his shot and it starts off with yet another potential 
poster for a cover.
     "Rage Against The Machine" [five parts!]
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Pat Spaziante
     Welcome to "Wild Kingdom."  I'm Jack Hannah.  Today we observe the 
Mobian hedgehog.  It's well-known that hedgehogs curl themselves up into
a ball to discourage attackers.  This behavior is also useful when throwing
tantrums, as Sonic appears to be doing when a decision by the Freedom 
Fighters meeting in session doesn't go his way.  Sonic has just proposed 
that he allow himself to be roboticized with a neuro-override to counteract
the effect on his mind so he can trash Robotnik.  Freddy Mendez's editorial
box doesn't exactly say "Been there, done that," but does serve to remind us
of the plot of "Steel-Belted Sally" [#29].  Rotor's objections are seconded
by Bunnie, who literally puts her foot down.  And when a partially
roboticized rabbit puts her foot down you can read it on the Richter scale.
Realizing he's got about as much chance of his plan being accepted as Pat 
Buchanan has of being the Republican candidate for President, Sonic storms 
out of the meeting.  Anyone else notice the piece of paper with the words
"is a dweeb" attached to Antoine's nameplate?  We may have some dissention
in the ranks, but Antoine's offhanded questioning of Sonic's loyalty draws
a sharp rebuke from Sally.
     To work off his frustration, Sonic heads for a "new training facility" 
in the Great Forest, conveniently located next door to the "Knothole Jail". 
Make that SERIOUS dissention; the existence of such a structure not only has
never been hinted at before, but seems kinda incongruous when we're talking
about FREEDOM Fighters.  Anyway, Sonic no sooner walks in the door than he 
goes through the quick cooldown routine: Nack the Weasel drops a barbell on
Sonic's head and the blue dude does that stars in the eyes thing.  Why didn't
Nack use an Acme(tm) anvil and make it official while he was at it?  Picking
up the plot of the Triple Trouble issue where he left off, he ties up Sonic 
for delivery to Robotnik.
     Upon arriving at Robotnik's, Nack informes the big guy that he won't 
turn Sonic over until he's been paid.  He also asks for a company car, his
own dressing room and $100,000 per episode.  Robotnik's counteroffer is that
Nack gets to leave Robotropolis alive, and he brings in a giant Crabmeat bot
as a dealmaker.  Nack sees the fairness in this arrangement and goes off to
represent the cast members of "Friends" in contract negotiations.  Without
further ado, Sonic is transformed into Mecha-Sonic.  His assignment: level 
Knothole.
     OK, now we get to the good part.  Mecha-Sonic's initial attack is 
blunted when he's confronted with multiple holographic images of the Freedom
Fighters to shoot at.  And who should arrive on the scene but a seriously-
upgraded Bunnie as this starts looking more like a Mortal Kombat plotline.
Bunnie's upgrades appear to include the ability to fly and a dictionary of 
Southern cliches.  She advises Mecha-Sonic to "surrender like the Yankees 
at Chickamauga" but Mecha-Sonic reacts by doing his one-robot impression of 
Pickett's Charge.  Bunnie telescopes her legs and gets out of the way.  While
the bot and the rabbot move on to a re-enactment of the battle between the
Monitor and the Merrimac, Sally puts in a call for help, which Tails relays 
from Knothole in a burst of technobabble.  By the end of the page Sally is 
speaking in tongues herself.
     And now's a good time to pause and catch our breath.  You may tour the 
Sonic Art gallery or while away some time scouring the "Find Your Name In 
Print Page."  Don't forget to visit the gift shop.
     Back to the story.  Robotnik has been monitoring the fight.  Apparently
inspired by that lightning rod bit in "The Rise of Robotropolis..." [#38],
Robotnik sends a current through Mecha-Sonic and into Bunnie.  Though dazed 
and quoting Tennessee Williams, Bunnie tries putting Mecha-Sonic out of 
action with a "pulse cannon".  Makes me long for the good old days when the
Freedom Fighters were going up against SWATbots armed only with slingshots 
and paint balls ("Sally's Crusade: The Quest", In Your Face #1).  Mecha-Sonic
decides to wrap up this Civil War re-enactment by playing Sherman to Bunnie's
Atlanta.  She hits the ground in considerably worse shape than Kelli Skrug 
after her second vault in the Olympics.  Now there seems to be nothing
standing between Mecha-Sonic and a soon-to-be flattened Knothole.
     Tails, meanwhile, has been briefing a familiar silhouette: Knuckles. 
Propelled into the air by some sort of ejector mechanism, Knuckles may not
have any fancy weaponry but he does have a grudge against what used to be 
Sonic.  The confrontation, however, is predictably one-sided.  With both 
Bunnie and Knuckles out of commission, Sally orders "Operation Last Resort" --
and I don't think she's talking about retreating to Cancun.
     Now THIS is more like it, campers!  You've got Spaziante's amazing 
artwork and a linear script by Gallagher that's easy on the quips.  Though
some of the lines are unforgivable.  Sally's spouting of babytalk, for 
instance.  I thought this bit about treating Tails like a kid was wrapped
up in "Southern Crossover."  Also, Sally's always struck me as having way 
too much class for that sort of thing.  The ONLY way I could see it happening
would be if Sally got an earful of Tails' speech in the {preceding} panel 
and (with a broad wink) decided to bring him down one shoe size.  In any 
event, we'll have to wait until the Mecha Madness special to resolve this 
plot.  And considering that this issue only just hit the local comic stands 
this past weekend, I have to hope I'll get to see it without ordering it.  
Come to think of it, I NEVER DID receive Sonic #38 in the mail!  Archie 
Comics, better run a Level One diagnostic on your distribution system.
     Sonic-Grams: my initial reaction to Eric Kessler's dedication to 
Richard Egner: "Gee, who died?"  Probably refers to some intern moving
on within the company, though I speak under correction.  Fred pumps the 
Mecha Madness issue, which will also feature a Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters
story and a Chaotix solo shot.  In response to one letter, Tails is credited
with attaining an altitude of 1,000 feet, Sonic lists a top speed of Mach 2 
as a hedgehog, Warp 1 as a bot, and they get it all wrong when asking if 
Sonic or Tails is related to Sally--it's Sonic and Tails themselves who 
relate to each other like sibs.  Brian Edwards asks if Sally will get her own 
series; while Sonic professes that Sal isn't interested, those of us who have
read Ken Pender's posts about reader demographics know better.  Once more, 
Sonic's speed is attributed to the fact that he was "born that way."
     All in all, the coolness of this issue has been amply justified.  
Double-bag this one while waiting for the Mecha Madness special to hit the 
stands.  I'll be waiting to see IF it hits the stands.  In one place around
here there were still issues of #35 for sale when #37 first came out, and to
this day another store has an orphan copy of Sonic & Knuckles #1 in its 
comic rack.  Better make that a Level Two diagnostic!
     
Sonic & Knuckles Mecha Madness Special #1 [n.d.]
   Cover: Spaziante has done some excellent covers for Sonic
comics.  In fact, it appears that about four of them appear on
the front of this issue.  I know Ken Penders has said that
Spaziante's art can sometimes go beyond the linear, but this is a
bit much even for a die-hard Spaz fan like myself.
     "Mecha Madness"
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Pat Spaziante
     [Caution: entering deconstruction zone.  Expect to encounter
major plotholes for the next 6 paragraphs.]
     Picking up where "Rage Against The Machine" [Sonic #39] left
off, Mecha-Sonic has beaten up Bunnie and Knuckles and is now
trashing Knothole.  Gallagher, in the first of numerous instances
of careless writing, tries to reassure the reader that Knothole
has been evacuated and the damage is "structural."  Fine, but
when your "structures" consist of simple thatched-roof dwellings,
we're still talking major urban renewal here.  Anyway, Rotor
brings out a grisly little souvenir from Sonic #3: the "Port-O-Bot"
roboticizer that made Bunnie what she is today.  While Rotor
expresses some hesitancy at fighting fire with fire, Sally starts
raving uncharacteristically and rather ruthlessly.  In the hope
that we won't notice how out of character she's getting, Knuckles
regains consciousness.  Unfortunately, he's still punchy from his
encounter with Mecha-Sonic and so he comes up swinging.  He decks
Antoine and almost knocks Rotor out before Sally gives him a boot
to the head.  Apparently, the best way to come to one's senses
after being beaten up is to get beaten up some more; the old
"hair of the dog" theory, I suppose.  The two of them then
exchange implausible pleasantries, implausible because they speak
of a time when Sally and Knuckles knew each other before
Robotnik.  It's been well-established (except for Gallagher,
apparently) that Robotnik took over Mobius when Sally and the
rest of the gang were about 5 years old ("Blast To The Past,"
Part 1), so there could have been nothing romantic about those
old times that they so fondly recall in the kind of really
insipid dialogue we haven't been treated to since "Growing Pains,
Part 2" (Sonic #29).  Yet insipid dialogue with romantic
undertones is apparently just what the veterinarian ordered, as
it causes Bunnie to come to.  Anyway, Gallagher gets back to the
plot as Sally hands Knuckles a neuro-overrider and he dives 
head-first into the roboticizer, despite Bunnie's warning that
roboticization can put a "cramp" in one's social life.  Uh, the
word is "crimp" not "cramp", Bunnie, but never mind.  Rotor starts
singing a hymn, but what's one more implausibility at a time like this?
     Back at what's left of Knothole, Tails has overseen the
evacuation of the village and, realizing that he's been targeted
by Mecha-Sonic, decides that this is a good time to make himself
scarce.  Mecha-Sonic, in a brief but noteworthy sequence, can't
quite bring himself to blow his little bro out of the sky.  This
moral dilemma is interrupted by Robotnik, who tells Mecha-Sonic
to just radio in the coordinates for Knothole so he can level the
place himself with...
     OK, Gallagher has done some stupid plot turns in the past. 
"Let's Get Small" (#33) with its "French Frirus" enemy was really
bad, and how he got Tails out of the Roboticizer in "Growing
Pains, Part 2" was incredibly dumb.  But to have Robotnik glibly
talk about literally nuking Knothole with atom bombs is just
plain unforgivable.  Gallagher proved in "Let's Get Small" that
he couldn't make the jump from storytelling to science-fact and
this only confirms it.  I'm sorry, but this is where Gallagher
lost me as a reader, only because I know too much about what
nuclear weapons can do.  As much as I wanted to be able to
suspend disbelief while reading the remainder of the story, I
simply couldn't.  
     OK, I got that off my chest, and Mecha-Sonic suddenly has
Mecha-Knuckles on his fanny before he can radio in the
coordinates.  The two of them reprise the same stalemate they
danced to in "Crash of the Titans" [Super Sonic v. Hyper Knuckles
special #1], including a VERY impressive two-page spread of them
duking it out.  Bear with me, the plotline gets complicated here:
Mecha-Sonic punches Mecha-Knuckles with sufficient force to send
him in the direction of Robotropolis and (what's not quite
clearly spelled out) into the path of the nuclear missiles. 
Mecha-Knuckles, however, draws Mecha-Sonic toward himself with a
magnetic field so that they both connect with the incoming warheads.
     As impressive as Spaz's artwork on page 15 might have been,
there was no way I could have taken it seriously as an atomic
blast.  Robotropolis is a wreck, but Gallagher conveniently never
broaches the possibility that any Mobian worker-bots (including
Uncle Chuck) might have been destroyed in the blast as well.  The
Freedom Fighters in the outskirts seem to have been miraculously
spared the standard nuclear firestorm which is the aftermath of
an atomic blast, as were both Mecha-Sonic and Mecha-Knuckles,
though they're much the worse for wear.  Mecha-Knuckles retrieves
Mecha-Sonic and, after some exposition that's at odds with the
facts from the TV show concerning the consciousness and will of
someone who's been roboticized (about which more later), he
catches up with the rest of the Knothole gang.
     Fasten your seat belts; from here on, the ride gets REALLY
bumpy!  Mecha-Knuckles is taken to the old roboticizer to be
deroboticized; apparently, it has a "reversal system" that nobody
thought of using on Bunnie at the time, or even now.  While
Mecha-Knuckles is in the oven, Nicole has run a diagnostic that
drags us all the way back to Gallagher's last effort, "Ring of
Truth" (#35).  Nicole lets it be known that when Sonic grabbed
that billionth ring and went through all that hoo-ha with the
Ancient Walkers, he managed to acquire an "internal shield"
(courtesy of Deus Ex Machina Internal Shield Company).  Despite
the merely "structural damage" to Knothole, Rotor no longer has
the equipment to try reviving Sonic, and apparently it doesn't
work if you were roboticized in some other contraption.  Nicole
then asks to do the job itself; the sequence on page 24 is
impressive if once more implausible.  Knuckles, himself restored,
"flies" home, thus indicating that the "ejector" unit in "Rage
Against The Machine" was a waste of time and an inconsistency in
the story.  So now it's time for the happy ending, right?  Wrong! 
Sonic is busted for treason: i.e., for allegedly disobeying
orders and going ahead with the plan he'd proposed back in the
beginning of "Rage...."  This is the set-up for issue 40's "court
martial of Sonic" plot, and frankly it's even more implausible
than the whole atom bomb business.  For one thing, Sally has not,
as far as anyone knows, declared Knothole to be anything more
than a resistance group fighting against Robotnik.  Technically,
even if she were of age she'd have no legal standing to invoke
any of the old Mobian laws unless she had declared herself to be
the head of a government-in-exile, which as far as I know she has
never done.  She is, after all, still holding out for the return
of the True King, her father.  Then, too, Uncle Chuck clearly
stated in the "Sonic Conversion" episode of the TV series that
roboticized Mobians are aware of what's going on around them: "we
just can't do anything about it."  Sonic even demonstrated this
by his hesitancy to shoot Tails several pages back.  A first year
law student could get Sonic acquitted of the charges.
     If you ever saw the film "A Fish Called Wanda" you know the
scene where Kevin Kline says : "DisapPOINTed!"  That's my verdict
on this story.  Once more, as with "Growing Pains," Gallagher starts out
strong only to falter badly coming out of the backstretch and
heading for the finish line.  Gallagher started well with
"Rage..."; he was trying to go beyond the merely jokey and write in the
spirit of the TV series and he had a simple, linear plot line to
work with.  By the SECOND PAGE of "Mecha Madness" when Sally is
talking like some kind of drill sergeant, I got the sense that the
train was going to jump the tracks.  Ken Penders has stated that, in the
past, stories which had involved two sets of art (Manak/Mawhinney
works such as "When Hedgehogs Collide", #21) ended up that way
because the artists and writers had to meet deadlines.  I'm
beginning to think Gallagher needs a backup writer for when he
runs out of gas toward the finish.  And Heaven help us, it's not over!
     So much for the story, as for the artwork, it was great art
in the service of a deteriorating storyline.  And Spaz continues
to provide the most amazingly erotic rendering of Sally.  Others
range from the cute to the moving.  But Ron Bauerle's point is a
good one: do we need to see the back of everyone's throats when
they have their mouths open?
     "Robotnik rules" art.  As if.
     "Don't Let The Island Hit You On The Way Down"
     Story: Kent Taylor; Art: Harvey Mercadoocasio (debut)
     The writer of "The Rise of Robotropolis..." (#38) teams up
with long-time inker Harvo on a story taking place on the
floating island.  We arrive in the middle of what looks like the
equivalent of a Royal Rumble wrestling match: the Chaotix are
getting beaten up by some unheralded invaders: Charmy Bee is
knocked out of the sky by Predator Hawk (no relation to
Studebaker Hawk -- considering the number of lame puns on display
in the rest of this issue, I thought I'd get you in the mood),
Mighty is knocked out by Guerrilla Warfare (guess what kind of
animal HE is?), Lightning Lynx (who looks like a Gremlin) attacks
Espio Chameleon, and Flying Frog gets the drop on...whoever the
croc is, I forget the name.  That takes up three pages;
"Suddenly" (these things always happen "suddenly") the Chaotix
wake up and do the House Afire(tm) routine on the others.  And it
only takes them ONE page; that's how you know they're the Good
Guys.  The match is interrupted by the appearance of "the former
ruler of Mobius", Mammoth Mogul, who stylistically bears a
striking resemblance to a bit player in a _manga_ by Osamu
Tezuka.  Having been exposed to the energy of a Chaos Emerald, he
had achieved "limitless power" and the key to the executive
washroom.  Apparently Limitless Power isn't all it's cracked up
to be because he was eventually dethroned.  Anyway, over the
millennia (with two "n"s, get it right!) MM says he has
discovered the true power of the Chaos Emerald embedded in the
head of his walking stick, and he is now ready to snatch the floating
island's emerald, make a play for Mobius and oust Robotnik. 
Which sounds good on paper, but one frontal assault from the
Chaotix and he's retreating to rethink his strategy over the next
few centuries.  Being immortal, you can afford to be lazy like
that.  Serviceable artwork, with (as I said) some Japanese
influences, in the service of a standard Set-Em-Up-Knock-Em-
Down-He-Who-Fights-And-Runs-Away plot.  For a villain MM is too much
of a pushover.  All talk and no action.  Reminds me of Pat Buchanan.
     "Eel of Fortune"
     Story: Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
     Gallagher returns to the medium he appears to be most
comfortable working in, God help us, as by popular demand (Hey,
*I* demanded a spin off comic for Princess Sally, but did they
listen?), the Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters from the Tails
Miniseries "Southern Crossover" do five pages of jokey shtick. 
The plot in a clamshell: freedom fighters meet new villain (Eel
Capone), freedom fighters defeat new villain.  Lotsa bad puns, a
stupid ninja angle, I've wasted too many electrons on this one already.
     Coming attractions: Sonic's court martial in #40 (and the
Nack is back); in #41 Geoffrey St. John makes a return visit as
we take another run at the Zone of Silence/Void/King Acorn plot
from "Heart of Darkness" (#36): "Daddy, whom would you rather
have as a son-in-law....?"; yet another 3-parter (I haven't even
seen issue 1 of the Knuckles 3-parter yet!), "The Death Egg
Saga."  Looks like the Death Star to me.  If Gallagher ends up
working on this one, rest assured the Farce will be with us!

Knuckles Miniseries [Jul-Sep 1996]
     "Rites of Passage"
     Story: Ken Penders and Mike Kanterovich; Art: Art Mawhinney
     Grab your coats, gang, we're going to the movies!  Anyone
who wonders whether film has an influence on popular culture
would do well to read this story, which contains a fair number of
film references.  Hey, this isn't the first time it's happened:
remember the eleven scattered reference to [mostly Beatle] song
titles in "The Good, The Bad, and The Hedgehog" [Sonic #11]?
     In the starring role is "Sonic's friendly nemesis",
Knuckles.  Sure, it's a mouthful, but how else do you explain to
the kids that a) Knuckles rates his own miniseries, despite the
fact that b) every time he and Sonic are in the same time zone
they try to pound the electrons out of each other?
     OK, we're here.  This theater has everything, even a video
game in the lobby.  Oops, my mistake, that's an ATM so you can
withdraw $20 in case you want to buy a tub of popcorn and a box
of Sno-Caps.  Change?  As if!
     The story starts off simply enough: Knuckles has entered the
Grand Conservatory and has to avoid a fair share of booby traps
[Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]. 
This he does with style, including a VERY nicely-done two-page
spread where flames, bullets, shurikens, etc. are all headed his
way.  After that splashy action sequence, we put on the brakes
for a two-page exposition of the plot.  Good thing, too, because
this story started way back with "The Hunt Is On" [Chaotix
Special #1] which began, what, only about SIX FREAKIN' MONTHS
AGO!!!  I know that three of those months were spent running in
place story-wise, but c'mon!  We cover that development, 
fast-forward through "Fathers and Sons", then cut to the chase of
"A Sense of History", the 3-parter that was the prelude to all this. 
Everyone understand the plot?  Don't worry, this isn't the first
time our memories will be refreshed.
     Flashback's over, cue the Knuckles-Being-Chased-By-A-
Boulder-In-A-Direct-Quotation-From-"Raiders of the Lost Ark"
scene.  A nice three-panel progression on page 8 of Knuckles
trying to stay one step ahead of the boulder doesn't negate the
fact that Indiana Jones is fully entitled to say "Been there,
done that."  What took me a while to figure out on my first read,
however, is that page 8 also begins a split-screen sequence; once
you know what's happening, it works well.  Anyway, Knuckles
manages to avoid becoming roadkill, and discovers a "concussive
blaster" in a nearby storeroom.  Using it to punch through a
doorway, he hears Archimedes' earlier taunt and begins following it.
     INTERMISSION: Sonic/Tails artwork.  Mother Of The Year honors 
go to Dorion Barill's mom for stitching together a Knuckles costume.
     Knuckles traces the voice to a room where the Chaotix have
apparently been partying since their abduction all those months
ago.  While considering renegotiating his contract, Knuckles
spies Archimedes, who turns out to be a fire ant standing on the
table.  To better see him, he speaks into a video camera and his
image is shown on the back wall [Wizard of Oz].  He also
apparently shops at the Paul Hogan "Crocodile Dundee" Boutique
because he's decked out in an Australian digger-style hat, vest
and a necklace of...hmm, what kind of teeth ARE those, I wonder? 
After a quick demonstration of his ability to disappear and
reappear in a puff of smoke [remember that -- it's important to
the plot], as well as his knack for breathing fire, he starts to
cop an attitude because "my people have pulled echidna fat out of
the fire more times than I can count."  This is no way to get on
Knuckles' good side, but before the echidna can call the Orkin
Man, who should appear but the mysterious figure from the split
screen sequence.  He announces that Dmitri "is no more."  He has
a new look; some have called it Egyptian, but from here the mask
looks more African than anything else (Memo to the Ancient
Walkers: THIS is the kind of look you should have been aiming
for!).  For me, the effect is spoiled by the fact that Dmitri has
rechristened himself with the unfortunate name "Enerjak."  Still,
like the Wing Dingoes of "Southern Crossover" the look is
impressive even if the name is a little on the stupid side. 
Knuckles and the gang attempt to rush him and are hurled aside by
a single gesture (Memo to Kent Taylor, with a carbon copy to
Mammoth Mogul: THIS is how a being with limitless power is
supposed to act!).  While keeping the Chaotix, Enerjak hurls
Knuckles and Archimedes out into the middle of a desert waste.
     INTERMISSION: Map of the Floating Island: Don't know
anything about the game zones, but it's nice to have if you want
to write any Knuckles fanfic and need to get your bearings.  Now
we know where John Ritts got the idea to ask for a map of Mobius
in his letter in Sonic #40.  And speaking of stupid names, whose
bright idea was it to christen the Letters column "Knuckles
Sandwich"?  Letters establish that Knuckles is 15 (that's 16 in
DiC years) and that the barbs on his gloves really do grow out of
his hands.  Wonder if he's tried soaking them in dishwashing detergent?
     KNUX II: THE SEQUEL: How much trouble can Knuckles and
Archimedes get into in the middle of nowhere?  Plenty, if you're
about to become lunch for that latest desert cliche peril: the
giant sandworm [Dune, Beetlejuice, Tremors; face courtesy of
Alien].  Anyone else catch the tribute to Bob Clampett on page 4? 
Utilizing a convenient rock and his disappearing shtick,
Archimedes makes short work of the foe and that evening our
heroes sit down to a repast of grilled sandworm, yum yum.  Time
for the next flashback: Archimedes needs three pages to inform
Knuckles that ants helped loosen the foundation of Echidnapolis
so that it could become the Floating Island -- does this mean
that the Chaos Emeralds are overrated?  Anyway, Archimedes cycles
through the rest of "Sense of History", followed by a quick cut
to Dmitri/Enerjak beginning to reconstruct Echidnapolis, now
bearing the snappy new name "Necronopolis."  All this happens in
split screen (again); as for Knuckles and Archie (hey, even
though it's supposed to be pronounced "Ar-Key" we know you can't
spell "Archimedes" without "A-R-C-H-I-E", right?) they throw in a
comic relief bit where a delirious Knuckles mistakes Archie for a
spicy meatball, with predictable results.  Knuckles, faint from
heat and hunger, then sees a vision: his father appears before
him [Hamlet -- OK, THAT one is a stretch!] who tells him that he
must be brave, that Enerjak can be defeated, and that he must
take his place in the Circle of Life [The Lion King].  Oh, and
did I mention the oasis over the next hill?  After some brief
R&R, the oasis vanishes.  We hope you enjoyed your visit to Deus
Ex Machina Resorts; please come again.  Knuckles and Archie don't
have time to debate much about it because the city that
Dmitri/Enerjak has been conjuring up during the split-screen
looms ahead of them.
     INTERMISSION: Knuckles art.  Consider it a short art film.
     Despite never having been to the place that I know of,
Knuckles recognizes the place as a "dark, corrupted reflection of
Echidnapolis."  We then get to see "Enerjak's Citadel" [while the
audience gets bludgeoned to death with references to "Wizard of
Oz"].  Knuckles comes out swinging [not a Tarzan reference], but
soon finds himself surrounded by Mecha-Nauts (low-budget SWATbots).  
He takes cover in the Citadel, only to discover Dmitri/Enerjak's 
defenses consists of the Chaotix, who are under Enerjak's control.
     INTERMISSION: Map of Necronopolis, and a second Knuckles
Sandwich.  Candice White observes that the names of the Chaotix
make identifying the characters rather difficult.
     KNUX III: THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION!  And welcome to the
Necronopolis Wrestling Federation's "Brawl To Win It All!"  It's
tag-team action with the Chaotix up against Knuckles and Archie. 
Archie starts with a fire-breathing offence he learned from Ricky
The Dragon Steamboat, which Vector counters with a firehose.  In
the resulting steam, Archie and Knuckles disappear.  After a
quote borrowed from Lamont Cranston [The Shadow], Knuckles comes
out swinging again.  Less than satisfied with the performance of
the Chaotix, Enerjak administers a remote-control sleeper hold
that puts out the lights for Knuckles and Archie.  With the hero
out like a light, it falls to Dmitri/Enerjak to supply this
issue's two-page exposition of the action, but not before a short 
     INTERMISSION: more Knuckles fan art.
     Dmitri/Enerjak's account of the events starting with "Sense
of History" is accurate but self-serving.  By now Knuckles has
come to, and (in the course of small talk) realizes that Enerjak
is clueless about the oasis.  He also nudges Archie into
beginning our final split-screen of the series, by which in
response to a telepathic command from Archie the ants come
marching.  Enerjak moves to finish off our heroes, but they pull
that vanishing stunt once more.  While Enerjak searches for his
elusive prey and the Chaotix are called out, ants from the
surrounding area converge on the Citadel.  Knuckles re-enters the
fray, and while he and Enerjak fight/banter, the ants are chewing
away at the Citadel's foundations.  Thanks to some rocket
boosters that attached themselves to the Citadel from out of
nowhere (courtesy of the Deus Ex Machina Jet Propulsion Labs),
the Citadel takes off like...well, like a rocket.  Knuckles and
Archie manage to escape as Enerjak rockets out of sight. 
Speaking of out of sight, Necronopolis vanishes as well, leaving
only the Chaotix as remnants.  The Good Guys party down, the
cloaked figure from "The Big Picture" (Sonic #33) is revealed to
be Knuckles' father, who has apparently traded in his Luke
Skywalker jacket for a Ben Kenobi robe, Knuckles quotes the
curtain line from "Casablanca" and, in a final bow to "Star Wars,"
we get a final shot of the Citadel hurling through space, like
Darth Vader's fighter.
     OK, we'll stick around for the closing credits: a layout of
the Citadel, and a final Knuckles Sandwich.
     I have no real kick against the use of motion picture
allusions in the story.  Face it: the core audience for the
comics isn't really primed for originality.  If they can be eased
through a story while leaning on the cozily familiar icons of
popular culture (film, other comics, pop songs, etc.), who am I
to say?  Credit Penders and Kanterovich for not slavishly following 
film plot lines (though some references, like the "Oz" set-up outside 
the Citadel, was just heavy-handed enough to be unforgivable).
     In a way, it's good that the series arrived late.  After the
"Rage/Mecha/Court Martial" series with its uneven Gallagher
scripts and shifts in artwork from Spaziante to Manak, it was
good to settle back and watch the Sonic Comics A-Team in action. 
Ken and Mike have delivered a strong story, despite the delay in
getting it launched.  The action was plentiful and, once you got
the hang of the split-screen layout, easy enough to follow.  More
important, the character of Knuckles had a chance to expand and
it made the most of it.  There was a hint in "Fathers and Sons"
that Knuckles' problem-solving skills (When in doubt, punch it
out) were due for an overhaul, and Archimedes proved an apt foil. 
His bag of tricks might seem meager (disappearing and breathing
fire) but, hey, all Sonic has going for him are speed and attitude, 
and look how far that's taken him.  Still, Knuckles actually 
broadened his character by the time the story was over; he was 
still Knuckles but not so much of a lone wolf.  THIS was the kind 
of scripting that "Growing Pains" demanded yet never achieved.
     Mawhinney's artwork may lack the splash and dash of
Spaziante, and is certainly not in the same league as Manak's
cartooney style.  It's a straightforward meat-and-potatoes kind
of artwork, well-suited for this kind of storytelling.  Though the 
design of Enerjak was a little confusing (try looking less like 
Dmitri, why don't you?), it was still powerful in its own right.
     All in all, an extremely well-done series.  There have been
recent rumblings about developments in the story in the coming
months.  If those developments are anything like the ones in this
story (where not a whole lot changes fundamentally but broadens
and deepens in terms of narrative and characterization), it will
be a major improvement to the series as a whole.
     Anybody remember where we parked? 
     
#41 [Dec 1996]
     Cover by the "anti-Spaz."  Ooooh, scary, kids!  Seriously,
another impressive cover.  And what's really impressive is that
despite the fact that everyone on the cover is screaming, Spaz
shows only two out of a possible three uvulae.  THAT's self-control!
Don't ask me what that purple thing is next to Sonic's
head; my best guess is it's the toe of one of Geoffrey's boots.
     "And One Shall Save Him."
     Story: Ken Penders; Art: Kyle Hunter [debut]
     Identify the source of the following line: "Since when was I
ever subtle?"  Was it:
     A) Sonic interrupting Robotnik yet again
     B) Ken Penders justifying yet another unbelievably heavy-handed
        movie reference
     C) My forthcoming review of "Sonic Live" to be followed by
        "Sally Dead"
Sonic comes into Robotropolis to do some shopping, despite the
damage to the city which is mentioned in passing and which has no
bearing on the plot.  Remember, Robotropolis has supposedly been
hit by an earthquake ("The Fall of Robotropolis", Sonic #37) and
nuked ("Mecha Madness").  Once again, despite all this, we don't
SEE anything remotely resembling carnage on a massive scale, not
even so much as a crack in the sidewalk, so the reader will be
forgiven for not taking these story arcs seriously.  Freddy Gabrie
doesn't help by throwing in an editorial box saying that the city
damage is "Nothing an earthquake...and a few bombs...can't take
care of."  Gee, Fred, I usually use that phrase to describe the
solution, not the problem!  Anyway, after a little five-finger
discount, Sonic heads back for Knothole, where he and guest star
Geoffrey St. John begin verbally sparring.  Sally tries to break it
up, and it falls to Rotor to get the plot back on the rails: it
involves some kind of "neutralizer", presumably not the same thing
as the "energy inhibitor"/bug bomb from "Heart of Darkness" (#36). 
Or maybe it is...this is never really cleared up.  Despite Ken's
having written both stories, the gears don't exactly mesh cleanly. 
Anyway, Sally's ready to undertake the mission to rescue her father
by herself.  Geoffrey suggests that, for the greater good, she stay
behind and that she let him take a crack at it.  Sonic suggests a
change in casting, followed by Geoffrey's offering to settle
matters by putting a crossbow bolt through Sonic's head.  Take it
easy, Ken, you'll get a chance to work out the ol' blood lust with
issue #47.  The two let their hormones take over and start slugging
it out.  On any other planet, such a confrontation between highly
competitive males would be settled in the classic manner: drop your
pants and get a ruler.  But since this is Mobius, none of the males
are wearing pants.  Instead of acting on her first instincts and
taking off through the portal while Sonic and Geoffrey continue
their male bonding ritual, she breaks up the fight and ends up
taking both of them along.
     Cut to the King verbally abusing some mutant toad who dropped
by to audition for Worst New Character of 1996.  The King then
suddenly has a flashforward seeing Sally, Sonic and Geoffrey in an
apparition that then disappears.  Cut to the gang as they slam into
a floating rock of some kind while Nicole works on her Mr. Data
impersonation.  They then are literally beside themselves; they
catch a glimpse of the confrontation they had with the King five
issues before.  Nicole explains that Robotnik's tampering with the
zone has caused a temporal rift to form, where they can witness
events of the past as well as the future.  If you're unclear on the
mechanics of this, watch "All Good Things...". the series finale of
"Star Trek: The Next Generation"; it's two hours well spent.  So
anyway, they then witness the King's first landing in the zone and
his being made leader of the Imps (you know, the reptilian types
who look like refugees from DOOM).  They witness him being fitted
with his suit of armor, but a solar wind of some sort separates Sonic 
from the group and puts him within striking distance of the King's lance.
     Fasten your seat belts; the ride gets really bumpy here. 
Sonic gets zapped back to Sally and Geoffrey who say he never left. 
The ones who are leaving, though, are the Imps, who are getting
sucked into some kind of vortex.  The group then figure out that
the jet packs they brought along to maneuver through the zone are
useless without a charge from the "neutralizer" that's supposed to
stabilize the zone.  Or something.  Anyway, as a last resort, Sally
and Geoffrey blast off with the energy from the neutralizer having
refueled Geoffrey's jet pack.  Sonic punches out Sally's old
man...hey, he started out trying to put Geoffrey's lights out so
why not keep things moving?  Geoffrey then activates the
neutralizer, which apparently still has some juice left in it.  The
trio returns with the King's limp body.  Sonic orders someone to
get "Doctor Quack" -- not a name that would inspire confidence. 
Maybe he should consider changing it to something that sounds more
professional, like "Hugo Z. Hackenbush."  Hey, Ken, how's THAT for
a film reference?  As we close, his condition is undetermined.

RDB note: well, _I_ wouldn't have gotten the HZH reference...

     Sorry, Ken, I wanted to give this story a chance but it needs
work.  I LIKE the idea of temporal flux, don't get me wrong, but
even though the events are as linear as can be expected in a
time-shift plot, something still feels wrong about the story structure. 
For instance, aside from an offhand remark or two, the rivalry
between Geoffrey and Sonic is forgotten when they're in the zone. 
Understandable, but maybe if Sally had gone in alone and Sonic and
Geoffrey had to try setting aside their differences to go in after
her and get the job done, the story would have had more of a hook.
     Not that the Kyle Hunter artwork is any help.  After a few
brilliant flashes (the bungee sequence, the first detailed drawing
of Robotnik, the first appearance of the King in armor), his
drawings go flat.  The problem isn't just that, as Alessandro 
pointed out, the characters are drawn out of proportion.  Their
expressions take on a mask-like sameness after a while.  Kyle
settles on one or two facial expressions for each character and
repeats them.  And repeats them.  There's none of Mawhinney's
subtlety or Spaziante's extravagance.  Geoffrey doesn't look
particularly threatening when pointing his crossbow at the back of
Sonic's head, nor does Sally seem moved by any kind of recognizable
emotion when confronting her father in the zone or when looking
down at his immobile form on the last page.  Speaking of which,
that last panel is a neat summary of everything wrong with the
artwork: without a background, the expressions and gestures are
revealed in all their emptiness.  You might want to switch Kyle
over to doing Chaotix until he gets the hang of it.  Maybe he had
to hurry to meet deadline, I don't know, but from expression to
composition to gesture Kyle's drawings just deflate by the end of
the story.  It never comes anywhere near the creepiness promised by
Spaziante's cover art.
     Sonic Art and Find Your Name: same old same old.
     Sonic Grams: Fred, you might not want to admit that the Death
Egg miniseries won't disrupt the story's continuity -- you're not
going to sell many copies that way.  Reminds me of Anna Russell's
celebrated statement about the close of Wagner's Ring Cycle: "And
so we find ourselves, twenty hours later, right back where we
started from!"  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to order it anyway.  Letters:
Mobie [ :-P ] and Dulcy [ :-) ] will be making future appearances,
and apparently #43 will be the Great Reconciler Issue where the
past will be explained and clarified...just before the current
scenario is abandoned in favor of the Brave New World set-up.
     Notes From The Net: THIS guy again!?  He needs to get a life! 
Alessandro again supplied the best answer concerning the number of
other Sega game allusions in "Rage Against The Machine": "WAY WAY
WAY TOOOOO MANY!"  

RDB note: did he make that comment on the other list?

Pat, I appreciate an inside joke as much as the
next guy, and I know that Sega makes many other games besides
Sonic.  But as David Letterman might put it in his uniquely
soft-spoken, urbane manner, "LET 'EM GET THEIR OWN DAMN COMIC BOOKS!!!"
By the way, one piece of fan art, three names and one SonicGram
came from Down Under.  Nice to know we've got readers in Oz.  Maybe
one of them can volunteer to coach Geoffrey on his accent; it could
use some work.  G'day, mates.

#42 [Jan 1997]
Spaz cover: Since a Chaos emerald features prominently in the
plot, think of this cover as Spaziante's salute to Chaos. 
Sonic's hands, head and feet are way too big in proportion to his
torso; Rotor is in-line skating with no skates; Bunnie's mouth
looks like it belongs to Carol Burnett; the only explanation for
Sally's posture is that she must have left her spine in her other
vest; and Antoine's left elbow is bending in the wrong direction. 
Should've saved this cover for an April Fool's Day issue.
     "In Every Kingdom There Must Exist A Little Chaos."
     Story: Kent Taylor/Art: Art Mawhinney
     Given the changes that will be happening to the story, Kent
goes for stability and opens with a cozily familiar sight: Sonic
and Knuckles trying to pound the snot out of each other.  Freddy
helpfully tags along and supplies information that we would have
gleaned had we read the Death Egg saga--that story line may not
have made a major impact on the plot line but it does leave a lot
of small potholes in the road.  In between blows, we learn that
Robotnik tried yet again to filch Knuckles' chaos emerald and
that Sonic knows about the spare one Knuckles acquired in "Crash
of the Titans".  He wants Knuckles to cut loose with the spare in
order to treat King Acorn.  Tails arrives and hastens along the
exposition by reminding us that King Acorn has recently been
rescued from the Zone of Silence but is suffering from an
advanced case of crystalysis (kri-STAHL-uh-sis: the process of
living tissue turning to crystal.  I think I just made it up.  No
royalties; use it freely).  In fact, he's turning into a Chaos
emerald...or at the least, a Chaos monarch.  Sonic manages to
shut Tails up about some development from SonicQuest #1 (as a way
to boost sales, no doubt).  Knuckles, however, turns Sonic down
flat.  Back at Knothole, Sonic delivers some extra power rings to
Sally and again muzzles Tails about something.  The power rings
having failed to revive the king, Uncle Chuck suggests some
alternative medicine.  Sal explains that she believes her father
wasn't wearing the genuine crown of the Acorn kings when he was
nabbed by Robotnik all those years ago.  An ancient scroll is
trotted out, which indicates that the true crown may be located
in the Hall of Limbo.  Next step: get a power ring and use it to fire 
up Sonic's brain cells so he can figure out how to get to the Hall.
     Early next morning Sonic, Sally and Tails rendezvous with
the "spy network" from "Rise of Robotropolis".  Sleuth, the
McGruff the Crime Dog clone, arrives on the scene and almost
immediately arouses Sally's suspicions.  Guess what, campers:
he's working the wrong side of the story line, as he brings in a
welcoming committee of SWATbots, with a roboticized Fly Fly
Freddy providing air cover.  It looks like Sleuth's got the drop
on the Knothole gang, but he gets dropped on by Bunnie instead. 
Unfortunately, everybody's so busy punching each other out that
nobody's got a spare moment for retrieving a fresh power ring. 
Sonic makes time and just before he can be zapped by Freddy (the
insect, not the editor), Knuckles drops in and takes out Freddy
before you can say "Help me!" [mandatory movie reference for Ken
Penders' benefit].  Sonic uses a move I've never seen before to
finish mopping up the SWATbots and Knuckles presents Sally with
the spare Chaos Emerald he swore 8 pages ago he'd never part with.
     One quick exposition from Uncle Chuck later, they try using
the Emerald to restore the King to normal.  No go; it only makes
things worse.  Before anyone can say "Well, that's 14 pages down
the drain!", we realize that it's now up to Sonic to use the
power ring to boost his brain with regard to the business about
the Hall of Limbo.  After a nice panel that reminds me of some of
the artwork of the old posters for the Fillmore in San Francisco
(if you have to ask, you weren't from the Sixties), he declares
that the King's sword has something to do with it.  Hey, try
muddling the plot with even more of these mystical doo-dads. 
Scrolls, crowns, swords--what next, the royal Lava Lite? 
Knuckles touchingly volunteers to undertake the quest for the
sword, telling Sally "You shouldn't have to lose your father
twice."  Uh, anyone want to break the news to Red about what the
Princess is REALLY going to lose come issue #47?
     Sonic Art: Rabbot art by Rabat.  No, it's not a failure of
the spell-checker.  Elysaar Khoury Rabat of Morocco supplies a
drawing of Bunnie.
     Well, we've wrapped up the Chaos story and so, in the words
of Bill Cosby, "I told you that story to tell you this one" as we
immediately segue to...
     "Knuckles' Quest"
     Story: Ken Penders & Kent Taylor; Art: Art Mawhinney & Brian Thomas
     Very nice opening sequence in the first page revealing a
very improbable development: Knuckles perched uneasily on an open
seat attached to the side of the SeaFox, with Tails at the helm. 
What, Rotor couldn't have installed a proper sidecar?  Couldn't
he have at least attached a seat belt?  How about one of those
horse collar arrangements you see on rollercoasters?  Anyway,
Tails supplies over a page of exposition taking in "Tttriple
Tttrouble," "Ring of Truth" and "Southern Crossover".  Nice to see
Ken & Kent have done their homework and anchored this story to
ones that have gone before.  Speaking of "Southern Crossover"
that's Tails' destination: Athair's crater in Downunda.  They
eventually run into the old dude and if you thought things were
weird up until now, strap yourself down.
     The Ancient Walkers reappear; this time, just the masks and
no dinosaur suits.  It helps.  Knuckles and Tails get hurled past
some faces that look like they belong on the Mobian equivalent of
a deck of Magic cards: a black cat, a crow/raven and a goat who
are supposed to be (respectively?) a "sorceror" [sic], a wizard
and an alchemist, along with what looks like a disreputable Tails
with a few years on him, a white rabbit and a horse in armor (a
charlatan, an enchantress, and a paladin--THAT one you can look
up yourself).  The ride ends and Knuckles is determined to go it
alone.  Part of the declamation by the Ancient Walkers goes:
"With patience and fortitude a blade of steel thou may embrace." 
Hmmm, "embrace" a blade of steel...OK, folks, place your bets:
who thinks that the King's sword is going to somehow end up being
Sally's ticket to the harp farm?
     I know that just about anything would have been an
improvement over the mediocrity that was "And One Shall Save Him"
-- OK, with the possible exception of "Sonic Shot II".  But WOW! 
The crew at Archie has really kicked out the jams for this one! 
Despite numerous digressions and editorial boxes, Kent keeps the
narrative moving with very few dead spots.  And there's the
saving grace of Mawhinney's artwork for when things threaten to
bog down: nothing happens in the top panel on page 5, but the
expression on Sally's face more than compensates.  It's a crime
that we haven't been getting this level of writing and artwork on
a regular basis up until now, and it's all the worse because this
current milieu only has eight more issues to run before the readers 
have a Brave New World thrust upon them.  Just when the gang at 
Archie looks like they've finally got a handle on the OLD world!
     The story line, and the Sonic comics generally for that
matter, have never been known for having a particularly high
mumbo-jumbo quotient.  Now all of a sudden we're up to our
amulets in magical objects, rhyming prophecies and archetypal
characters.  Looks like I'd better keep my copy of Joseph
Campbell handy again.  I don't want to say that this was the only
way the Archie gang could figure out to bring the Sonic saga to
some kind of satisfactory conclusion--heck, I'm having to resort
to it myself in my fanfic--but this far along they haven't made
any missteps on a path that could leave the story looking rather
ridiculous.  Kind of like the business with the Chaos emerald --
after chasing after it for all those pages, it doesn't work
anyway.  But that's an issue for another issue.
     Sonic-Grams: only one page, with very little hype from
Freddy.  He doesn't even mention #43, all the while keeping our
attention on the SonicQuest series and the Sonic LIVE! Special
issue.  B. J. Kvito of Worthington, Ohio, wants to see (among
other things) stories about "Knuckles' and Sally's shared
childhood."  At the rate things are going, however, the only way
that's going to happen will be in flashback, as Knuckles indulges
in misty watercolor memories of the way we were....  Speaking of
which, unless something's come up, #43 is supposed to be the
major flashback/origins issue.  THAT I want to see!  But first I
have to wait for SonicQuest to come in the mail and see whether
Sonic LIVE! will hit the stands.

#43 [Feb 1997]
     Spaziante cover art.  Nowhere near as STUNNING as the inside
splash page.  One of the most moving Spaziante pieces ever!  I'd
really like to see it without the credits in the corner.  And
while we're at it, lose Geoffrey as well.  What the heck, strip
out Sonic too and you have a perfect Sally Memorial Poster.

RDB note: and not an uvula in sight :^)

     "The Dream Zone"
     Story: Ken Penders; Art: Manny Galan and Pat Spaziante
     "Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!  They're not
available?  Then how about just Dr. Howard The Duck?"  C'mon,
can't Galan draw ducks that DON'T look like that feathered loser? 
And how did a hospital manage to survive Robotnik's takeover of
the planet?  And why didn't the Knothole crowd get the King there
sooner, like they said they were going to at the very end of "And
One Shall Save Him" (Sonic #41), instead of wasting time
experimenting with power rings and Chaos Emeralds?  And most
important of all, where did the good ducktor hire that nurse with
Farrah hair in the background of the opening panel?  
     Dr. Quack makes his opening borrowing not only Howard the
Duck's look but Telly Savalas' mannerisms from the old "Kojak"
series.  This is never a good sign.  In the hands of a lesser
writer it's a way of saying to the reader: "I don't know what I'm
doing with this character, I don't have a feel for his thoughts
and emotions, so I'm going to superimpose someone else's identity
on him, no matter how obscure the reference might be to the core
audience, until I can come up with something."  Of course, Ken
Penders is one of the premier Sonic writers at Archie and he'd
NEVER stoop to something like that.  It would be as unforgivable
as...oh, I don't know...as killing off one of the main characters
to try to keep the readers off-guard.  But I digress.  
     Anyway, the best Dr. Q can do is try some cell regeneration
pyrotechnics and hope for the best.  As with the power rings,
there's no change; unlike the Chaos Emerald, the King hasn't
gotten any worse.  The doctor absents himself while the Knothole
crowd holds vigil.  Sonic's question at the bottom of page 3--Is
the King aware of what's going on around him--isn't answered
(sort of) until the bottom of page 5.  No, the Canadian printers
didn't screw up the colors again.  The pseudo-sepia tone is their
way of saying "Cue the flashback!"  Galan tags in Spaziante and
the scene shifts to...Sonic and Sally as a couple of kids a la
"Blast To The Past."  In fact, much of the flashback is faithful
to the canon (which is more than can be said for Part Three of
this story, but we'll get to that in due time).  Anyway, watchers
of the series know that Julian of the War Ministry was supposed
to be overseeing the dismantling of that department; he, however,
has other ideas.  Changing his name to Ivo Robotnik, he stages a coup.  
     There are a few small deviations from the canon in the
flashback.  For one thing, Uncle Chuck is never credited with
developing the Roboticizer (a project he abandoned when he
realized that a roboticized Mobian's enhanced physical well-being
would be undermined by a loss of free will; Julian simply stole
the plans).  In fact, Uncle Chuck gets no credit at all.  Sally's
nanny, Rosie, who puts in an appearance at the bottom of page
[8], is somewhat off-model.  And Julayla is somewhat more than
somewhat off-model in her appearance on page 7!  She bears NO
RESEMBLANCE AT ALL to the Julayla who appeared in "In The Still
Of The Night" (Sonic #18).  Didn't Spaziante have access to #18
with its ELEVEN DIFFERENT DRAWINGS of Julayla's face?  Didn't he
think to ask Art Mawhinney if he possibly had a Julayla model
sheet he could work from?  Has Spaziante got something against
cats?  Still, even this lemon could have yielded some serious
lemonade.  If Sally's word balloon on the righthand side of page
7 had used the word "Mommy" instead of "Julayla" it would have
made far more sense, would not have necessitated Spaziante's
redrawing the panel, and would have given the fans something to
talk about for months to come.

RDB note: that's all I need, more e-mail :^)

     To kick off Part 2, Geoffrey St. John shows up for no other
reason that to honk off Sonic; he doesn't even pretend to have
any part to play in the story line other than to barge in looking
for Sally so she can have another pair of arms to rush to.  Not
that the dialogue is any help in the coherency department; it
constitutes about three pages of verbal wheel-spinning during
which the Quackster informs us that he studied under Drs. (Ben)
Casey, (Marcus) Welby and Frankenstein (that's "Fronkensteen!"). 
After wading through this, we arrive at Sally's conclusion that
something's "bothering" her father but she can't say what.  The
Quackmeister concurs that the King is in an unresponsive stupor. 
Actually, it's a cue for the next flashback, wherein he remembers
Robotnik's takeover and his own exile into the Void/Zone of
Silence.  This particular bad trip causes him, stupefied though
he is, to cry out.  So Quackerino trots out the latest in the
long line of Improbable-Looking Plot Devices.  Let's see, we've
had the Neuro-Overrider that looks like a calculator battery
("Steel-Belted Sally", #29) and the Zone Neturalizer that looks
like a household bug bomb ("Heart of Darkness," #36).  So is it
any wonder that the Quackmeister's Electroencephalographic Memory
Inducer looks like a glorified gumball machine?  I didn't think
so.  Despite the stated dangers of this kind of mind meld (too
bad the Quackmaster didn't study under Drs. McCoy, Crusher and
Bashir), there's no shortage of volunteers to make the trip. 
Sonic wins the (very dubious) coin toss, he begins journeying
into the King's head and any semblance that we've been following
the Sonic canon sails right out the window.
     Once more Sonic and the King encounter each other in space,
only now the King has no trouble recognizing Sonic as Sir
Charles' nephew.  Sonic calls it a "wild, strange trip."  That's
"LONG, strange trip", Sonic, but I guess you aren't that much of
a Deadhead.  Before they can figure out how to get someplace
recognizable, they confront the Warlord Kodos.  You remember the
Warlord Kodos, don't you?  No?  That's not surprising since there
hasn't been word one about the dude since an offhand reference by
Robotnik back in "Heart of Darkness."  Kodos, who looks like
Mobie the (yeah, right!) Cave Bear having a very VERY bad hair
day, uses a huge battle ax to take a swing at the King.  Sonic
attempts a rescue and gets nowhere for who should appear but
FEIST, some kind of giant skunk/badger/wolverine with glowing
eyes.  Hey, you can admit to being confused; we're all friends
here.  And the awkward placement of one of Sonic's word balloons
in the middle panel of page 20 so that it can easily be mistaken
for one of the King's word balloons doesn't help matters.  Feist
nukes Kodos, but before he can do anything to the King Sonic
launches into some heavy (for him) dialogue; as he explains that
Feist and everything else around them is just part of the King's
memory, he starts using some pretty big words we're not used to
hearing from Sonic, and he loses his hip argot completely.  I
suppose that all bets are off when you're roaming around inside
someone else's head but in any other context this would be called
"breaking character".  Sonic briefs the King on current events
and tells him he's got to struggle against the crystallization
because "We need your experience and wisdom...But above all else,
Sally needs her father."  Yeah, to deliver her eulogy four issues
from now!  Sonic wakes up with a headache, the King's vital signs
stabilize, and the blue dude misquotes Shakespeare's "Tempest". 
All in a day's work.
     I don't suppose there could have been anything else to do
with the story line to justify a return to the events of "Blast
To The Past" without yet another shot at time travel.  I got the
point--that the King needed to begin healing from the inside
after all these months--but Ken didn't make it easy.  Some of the
bits with Quack (who's an even bigger candidate for Worst New
Character than either Kodos or Feist) were really expendable.  So
was Manny Galan's artwork.  I have been browsing the newsstand
copies of "Sonic Quest" 

RDB note: so I assume your reviews will wait till you get your own copies?

and was pleasantly surprised to see the
quality of Galan's artwork improve from Part 1 to Part 2; the
artwork on Part 2, Page 10 is VERY impressive!  It seemed like he
was taking Spaziante lessons.  So I was UNpleasantly surprised to
see the quality of his artwork take a tumble here.  Sally's
emotions as she ran to Geoffrey in Part 2 were unrecognizable. 
It reminds me of the deadness of Kyle Hunter's art in "And One
Shall Save Him" (#41) which marked a new low in the quality of
Sonic comic art; heck, that one gave me a new appreciation for
the work of Dave Manak!  This story was marginally worth it, the
artwork was definitely NOT worth it (pseudo-sepia is not a good
color for Spaziante); the whole production was eclipsed by the
Spaz splash page that preceded it all.
     Sonic-Grams: Sorry, Fred, I DIDN'T enjoy "this
little...concoction".  As for his promise of a "roller-coaster
ride" for Sonic #50: unless Ken's been teasing the lot of us and
plans to resurrect Sally at the conclusion of "Endgame" it'll be
a trip I'm going to make with a vast reluctance.  Also a plug for
Sonic #44: The Antisonic and the Antiknuckles come to Mobius.  
That's an angle I didn't think of when writing about the
Antibunnie in my fanfic "When A Bunnie Meet A Bunnie" (available
on finer Sonic Web pages).  Betcha my Antisonic is more evil than
yours; well, he's kinkier, anyway.  

RDB note: so how _does_ your story rate in the sex/violence category?
I might want to check it out if it's PG-13 or less...

Letters: Jacob and Jason Lower ask, among other things, about Sally's 
species.  OK, people, it's clear that nobody's reading the FAQ File on
this one and nobody's buying the line that she's a ground squirrel.  We'll
just have to wait until issue #47 in order to say once and for all 
whether she's a ground squirrel, a shot squirrel, a strangled squirrel....

#44 [Mar 1997]
     Cover by Spaziante.  No, your eyes aren't playing tricks on you; 
there ARE two Sonics and two Knuckles (or should that be "Knuckleses"?)
     "Black and Blue and Red All Over"
     Story: Ken Penders/Art: Manny Galan
     Every now and then, a sequence from the comic comes along
that perfectly encapsules the trend that the comic is taking. 
The first two pages are just such a sequence, and they don't bode
well for Sonic.  I usually save my in-depth analysis until after
the synopsis, but this is too blatant to pass up.
     The story opens with Rotor showing off a weapon
which...well, let's just say you gotta have some pretty poor
self-esteem to be fooling around with something like this!  He
calls it the "Party-Hearty Quadra-Sonic Rock'N'Roller"; 

RDB note: shouldn't that have been "heartily"?

let's just call it the "BFG" to save time.  Rotor never gets a chance
to use this monstrosity in the story, but Freddy assures us that
we will see it in use soon enough.
     I don't know about anyone else, but one of the things that
sucked me into the "Sonicverse" was a certain "romance" about the
notion of a group of small, outnumbered and outgunned creatures
taking on the likes of Dr. Robotnik and his SWATbots armed only
with cunning, conviction, and occasionally with paintballs.  The
Knothole residents were never "technologically impaired" (to
borrow a phrase from Weird Al's "Amish Paradise"), but
they were closer to nature than Robotnik ever was.  Rotor's digs
were NEVER as high-tech as they've come to be in the comic, and
in the SatAM show the weaponry never got more advanced than catapults 
and slingshots {with the occasional remote control explosive device).
     But it's clear that Archie plans a SERIOUS move away from
the SatAM canon.  Unfortunately, this also involves undercutting
one of the defining characteristics of the Knothole Freedom
Fighters.  Arming the group is a step in the worst possible
direction.  And never mind the visual joke with the "Star Wars"
vehicle in the background on page 2--what the heck is Rotor doing
with a canister of poison gas (first page, third panel)?
     Let's get on with the plot synopsis before I get any more
depressed.  After an alarm signals that there's trouble on the
Floating Island, most of the Knothole crew (guess who DOESN'T
make an appearance) boards a plane.  The "Hanger 18" joke didn't
work when Art Mawhinney tried it in the Sally miniseries and
Manny Galan can't make it work here, either.  

RDB note: good eyes - I didn't catch it...

On the Island, Knuckles checks on the Chaos Emerald only to discover 
the Antisonic.  In a serious continuity error, the Antisonic's shown
wearing sneakers throughout the story instead of his customary
engineer boots.  Knuckles also runs into, and gets beaten up by,
the Antiknuckles.  There must be a poor continuity virus going
around; Antiknuckles sports a beret which changes from blue to
green and back again throughout the story.  The only thing more
changeable is his pseudo-Irish accent, which has to stand as the
second-worst excuse for an Irish brogue I've ever heard.  BTW, I'm 
part Chicago Irish myself, so I think I speak with authority on this 
matter.  Knuckles gets knocked out and the two Antis leave empty-handed.
     Knuckles may have gotten the two Antis out of his dreads,
but soon company comes calling as Archimedes and the Knothole
freedom fighters show up in rapid succession (and, in Tails'
case, SERIOUSLY off-model).  Sonic recognizes the description of
his old counterpart and an idea forms behind his baby browns
(Note: isn't this the first time that Sonic has ever been
depicted having eyes of ANY color other than black?).

RDB note: again, good eyes!

     Quick cut to the Cosmic Interstate.  Here we temporarily
abandon the plot for a short interlude about how Sally met
Knuckles.  This actually fits the facts better than the mush Mike
Gallagher tried passing off in "Mecha Madness".  There's been
some speculation as to what "rules of apprenticeship" may have
been violated, but having been in the Boy Scouts I could figure
it out easily enough.  

RDB note: as the/a resident nerd in school, I wasn't popular enough to make 
it past Webeloes...

Every year at summer camp a couple of
members from each troop would be tapped to undergo an
indoctrination for something called "the Order Of The Arrow." 
One of the conditions of the ordeal was that you had to maintain
strict silence for a 24-hour period.  My guess is that by even
talking to Princess Sally, let alone being seen by her, the young
Knuckles must have violated some rule against contact with
strangers.  Sorry to say, I found this sequence to be the most
interesting thing about the story.  Knuckles also lets drop the
information that his "quest" hasn't gone well; in effect, after
several issues where the health of King Acorn has been of prime
concern, we finally discover on page 11 that his condition hasn't
changed and let's keep this story moving, shall we?
     They arrive on the world of the Antisonic.  There's a brief
recap as to what the place is about, though we don't see much of
it or of the Antisonic's gang this time around.  By the way, did
you figure out who's been missing?  Yep; once more in the
Antisonic saga, both Bunnie and the Antibunnie are conspicuous by
their absence.  It seems that the Archie crew still hasn't been
able to figure out whether Bunnie's counterpart would be partially 
roboticized as well.  So (shameless self-promotion coming!) it looks 
like I've got that particular market cornered with my fanfic "When A 
Bunnie Meet A Bunnie".
     As I said, there's no one in sight until Antisonic and
Antiknuckles show up and start beating up on their counterparts. 
Several readers have asked: "Why didn't Sonic remember that it
was useless to fight against himself, as he discovered in "When
Hedgehogs Collide" (#24)?."  I've got a better question: "Why are
Tails, Rotor and Sally just standing around like this doesn't
concern them?"  Then maybe Tails wouldn't have to complain about
how boring the fight is getting, as he does on page 14.
     OK, let's take a break.  Carey Brown's fan art is EXTREMELY
interesting, but why did the Archie people color his "companion"
Pepto pink?  Remember, Archie insists on black-and-white
submissions only so they're at fault for not knowing what color a
female fox should be.
     Back to the action, which has taken an unexpected turn when
the Aniknuckles drops both the pugilistics and his accent.  I've
read his speech at the bottom of page 15 several times and his
motivation STILL isn't all that clear to me.  Anyway, it develops
that he's the Guardian of a Sunken Island on this world, and it's
running out of air.  Interesting concept, actually.
     One quick ride in a sort of shuttle later, the gang arrives
at "Atlantinopolis" where they detect a sinister presence. 
Nicole takes time out from downloading an Alfred Hitchcock film
and an Ayn Rand novel to give the gang directions where they
encounter Dr. Robotnik.  Not the benign Robotnik, but the crud
from their old world.  Seems he wants to use the Chaos Emeralds
from the Antiworld to power some device that creates
"interdimensional doorways" and to do so without alerting the
Knothole crowd as to what he's doing.  That way he could steal
the Floating Island's Chaos Emeralds as well from the comfort and
privacy of another dimension.  But now that he's been found, he
orders his SWATbots to send the furries out to sleep with the
fishes.  In trying to save his own skin, however, the Antisonic
lets slip that he and Robotnik have been in league all along. 
The gang starts ganging up on Robotnik who begins praising the
flavor of "roasted hedgehog" -- so THAT'S why we haven't seen
Uncle Chuck lately!  Anyway, both Knuckleseses (YOU know what I
mean) use the resident Chaos emerald to bounce the weapon's beam
back onto itself, sending Robotnik back where he came from.  They
do a quick restoration job on the air supply unit and the crew is
returned to the surface.  In his final scene, the Antiknuckles
takes one more shot at his bogus brogue and still can't pull it
off.  As for Rotor, he's bummed that a scanner unit he deployed
earlier proved to be useless.  "BACK to the drawing board for
YOU," Sonic says.
     Which is where this story should have gone.  The basic plot
was workable, but Galan's artwork was no help at all.  Aside from
Sally's flashback sequence, it was as lame as always.  PLEASE,
let Galan work on the Chaotix, let him do flashbacks (his
drawings of the young Sally were far more appealing than his
drawing of the adult Sally), but keep him away from the regular
cast members!  I know Art Mawhinney has been busy warming up for
Sally's demise, but come on!
     And while we're at it, let's STOP and enjoy the MISPLACED
emphases in Vickie Williams' lettering WORK.  Just for fun, try
reading the word balloons out loud and YELLING out the words that
are heavily shaded, such as Archimedes' line "I HURRIED over as
soon as I HEARD there was TROUBLE!"  Or Sally's line: "We would
TRAVEL to locations ONLY my father knew of!"  Ending that last
sentence in a preposition is the least of its problems.  Next
time, Vickie, try speaking the dialogue out loud so you GET a
better SENSE of which WORDS to EMPHASIZE!  Hey, you're in a
business where a lot of people probably go through the day
talking to themselves anyway.
     Sonic-Grams: Plug for "Knuckles; The Dark Legion".  Freddy
seems more concerned about the covers of the story than what's
inside.  He also speaks of the "future of Mobius" and "Endgame." 
He tries his best at hinting darkly at something; like the
cyber-Mobians don't already know what's coming!  Mobie's back in #45,
and Knuckles' quest continues.  And he gives over a whole
paragraph to promoting "Sonic Blast", the Glorified Print Ad
(a.k.a. "comic adaptation) for the new video game.  Don't ask me
what the game is about: I've been stuck in the second scene of
the Jungle Level of Sonic 1 for Game Gear so long I'm beginning
to feel like Robin Williams in "Jumanji".  Letters: Freddy hedges
on Amy Rose's next appearance and spells out the difference
between "Metal Sonic" and "Mecha Sonic".  "Notes From The Net"
FINALLY gives out the address where to send e-mail.  The "Sonic
Checklist" not only features a 3D Sonic rendering and background
signage in Japanese, but also (with no fanfare whatsoever)
advertises the reprinting of the Princess Sally miniseries.  They
also offer a "Sonic & Knuckles" reprint for $3.  Heck, for the
cover price I got a copy of the REAL THING that had been
languishing in the comic rack of a local Rite-Aid for over a year.

Sonic Live! [no date]
     "The Last Game Cartridge Hero"
     Story and art: Ken Penders
     "It was a dark and stormy night."  When you can use that sentence 
at the beginning of a review, you KNOW there are going to be problems.
     It looks like Sonic and Robotnik are finally going to go one-on-one,
with an electronically zombified Sally in attendance.  By
the bottom of page three, Sonic has been blasted to particles by a
half-dozen SWATbots.  On the facing page, BTW, is an ad for the
live action remake of "101 Dalmatians" with Glenn Close as Cruella
DeVil.  Ivo Robotnik, have I got a girl for you!
     Quick cut to Chez Penders, where son Stephen is complaining
about HIS dying, at least in the video game sense.  He and Ken's
niece, Jessica, head off for school unaware of the gloved hand
reaching out for them from the TV screen.  On the other side of the
glass, a frustrated Sonic tries making sense of his location.
     Quick cut back to Mobius where Robotnik prepares to do away
with the rest of the freedom fighters.  Quick cut back to the
intermediate zone (get used to the jump cuts, gang).  The kids
return from school and Sonic senses someone at the other end of
wherever he is.  Unable to cross over to their side, he ends up
pulling Stephen and Jessica into wherever he is.  Once again, as in
"The Dream Zone" (Sonic #43), Sonic loses his hip-cool vocabulary
and begins speaking in tongues: "The surrounding energy surged to
the point where I was able to make contact with you.  Now the
energy surges are coalescing at another point!"  Sonic and the kids
head for that other point, without benefit of a yellow brick road.
     As part of an economy drive, Robotnik plans to launch the
remaining freedom fighters into orbit aboard the same rocket that
will carry a "network of killer satellites" into orbit above
Mobius.  Sally, BTW, has been placed "in the rocket's lower level
but I wouldn't worry about her."  In fact, nobody gives her a
thought for the next 17 pages.  Sonic and the kids materialize on
the rocket's scaffolding.  The grudge match between Robotnik and
Sonic is postponed while SWATbots take the two kids hostage.  Sonic
breaks out of the temporary stalemate and whisks Stephen and
Jessica to the rocket's control room.  While he tries to figure out
how to abort the launch, Robotnik is left to contemplate the portal
through which the three emerged.  Sonic manages to stop the
countdown by what amounts to sheer dumb idiot luck, but upon
returning to the portal he and the kids get sucked in.
     Once on the other side, they find Robotnik, Snively and a
bunch of SWATbots.  They also find that Stephen and Jessica have
been drawn in a manga-esque style with huge eyebrows; Jessica,
however, lacks the big huge enormous eyes with gigantic pupils and
about four highlights per eye.  Seems Robotnik's been a busy little
boy, bringing in several versions of himself from multiple
universes to construct a gigantic robot of himself.  Stephen
guesses all this in a moment because he's watched so much "Star
Trek"; Sonic is confused because of the reference to "Space Trek"
which was probably done to placate the legal beagles at Archie
and/or Paramount.  The three are taken prisoner and end up sharing
a cell with...well, they're never really identified by their full
names.  There's a black-haired guy named Mori and a blond named
Jerry.  Employees of Sega, I can only suppose.  Meanwhile, Robotnik
figures out that the "multi-dimensional portal to our world" was
created by Mori and Jerry "in the act of creating so-called
entertainment."  Hey, it's ROBOTNIK'S phrase, not mine! 
Unfortunately, the Doctor doesn't have much time to gloat before
the alternative Robotniks begin to turn on him.  Meanwhile (got
whiplash yet?), Sonic, the kids, and the Sega employees get busted
out by what turns out to be a redhead in a walkaround Robotnik
suit, possibly Jennifer Hunn of Sega in a thankless cameo.  With a
vast reluctance, Sonic rescues Robotnik from himself (or should
that be "his selves"?).  The only way to wrap up this story is to
punch in an access code on a control panel that just happens to
resemble a gigantic Sega game pad.  Being a 90s kinda kid, Stephen
knows the codes.  The code shuts down the SWATbots; I tried it on
my Game Gear and it didn't do a thing.  The giant Robotnik...well,
that never DID become a serious part of the plot any more than the
killer satellites.  After Jerry and Mori guess that they can send
Sonic and Robotnik back where they came from, Sonic says farewell
to the kids and makes the return trip.  He happens to find Sally
and Tails and the group having escaped from the rocket, about which
more later, while Stephen and Jessica grab another game cart.  They
also get credit for their contributions on Freddy's "Sonic Live!"
page, and they get drawings published on the Fan Art page, proving
once again it's not what you know but who you know.
     This story was probably doomed from the moment Ken Penders
took its title from the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger bomb, "The Last
Action Hero."  In that film, a boy named Danny (no relation) uses
a "magic ticket" to find himself in the latest Arnold-style action
movie.  Whether or not it was an interesting premise for a film,
the end result was a disaster.  Most critics agreed that the film
had no clear direction--it didn't know whether it wanted to BE an
Arnold movie or a SPOOF of an Arnold movie.  Something of the same
aimlessness is on display in this story.
     When I first read the premise I thought it would go in either
one of two directions: either real people would find themselves
inside the world of a video game (as in Disney' "Tron") or else the
game characters would find themselves in the real world (as in Woody 
Allen's "The Purple Rose of Cairo").  Ken ends up banishing everyone 
to a "neither world" which is neither like reality nor the games nor 
even like the animated Mobius.  This was a fatal miscalculation.
     Introducing humans into the game grid might have posed some
problems, but nothing that couldn't have been thought through. 
Bringing Sonic and Robotnik into the real world, however, would
have been rife with possibilities.  While Stephen and Jessica try
to introduce Sonic to their lifestyle (in scenes reminiscent of
E.T. discovering television and beer), Robotnik could decide to
take over Earth.  As a character from a video game he'd be in a
position to do it, too.  Since he and Sonic owe their corporeality
to negative electrons striking phosphors on a TV screen, he could
use his devious mind to figure out a way to tap into ambient
electromagnetic energy and microwaves and make himself as
formidable a foe as the shape-shifting T-1000 from "Terminator 2". 
Until Stephen and Jessica save the world using...refrigerator
magnets.  Seriously!  The magnets would have a major disruptive
influence on the electrons in Robotnik's body (something the kids
would discover when Sonic is seriously weakened the closer he gets
to the family fridge).  So it's easy to imagine Stephen and
Jessica, armed with a handful of tacky refrigerator magnets and
hurling them at Robotnik like a couple of ninjas throwing
shurikens, cutting him down to size and enabling Sonic to subdue
him and return to their own reality.
     There were certainly a couple of stories in the situation that
Ken COULD have told, and which would have worked far better than
the one he DID tell.  But neither improvements in art (having seen
Ken's artwork in an issue of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" I
know that he's no slouch as a portraitist) nor in writing could
have corrected the most basic flaw in the piece.
     I've been regularly corresponding with a member of this list. 

RDB note: the _other_ list...

Well, actually, he's been writing fan mail to Princess Sally and
I've been sending them along   ;-)  .  He has said repeatedly that
his life on Earth is boring and that if he could get to Mobius he'd
go there in a heartbeat.  I don't think this impulse should be
ignored as a manifestation that an individual needs to get a life. 
This, after all, is what's at the heart of fandom: the fact that
fictional characters can become so real that people recognize them
as distinct personalities.  They consider them to be as real and as
knowable as people in their own lives.  In short, they CARE about
the characters.
     This is nothing new; people have been feeling this way about
fictional characters for centuries.  Hamlet asks "What's Hecuba to
him, or he to Hecuba?" when one of the dramatic players weeps for
a fictional character.  At some point, everyone has encountered in
fiction characters who have taken on just such a reality, whether
it's Huckleberry Finn, Walter Mitty, or Bigwig, Fiver and the rest
of the rabbits in Richard Adams' "Watership Down."  This is a
valuable resource, it helps fuel such success as the comic book
enjoys and, sadly, Ken Penders and Archie are squandering it.
     In looking back on this story, I was reminded of the words of
a producer of another Hollywood film, "Heaven's Gate," which cost
$35 million in 1980 and was aptly summarized in one review as "an
unqualified disaster."  In surveying the audience at a preview of
the film, Stephen Bach realized that they were dead silent
("comatose with boredom" as he put it) because "not one of them had
been made to CARE about what was happening on that screen." [_Final
Cut_, p. 361, emphasis original].  Sonic fans care deeply about
Sonic and Tails and, yes, they care about the soon-to-be-late
Princess Sally.  Had they been made to care about Stephen and
Jessica or the Sega people to an equal degree, the story would have
been different, certainly better.
     "The Substitute Freedom Fighters"
     Story: Rich Koslowski; Art: Art Mawhinney
     This is a prequel/sequel to "Last Game Cartridge Hero". 
Having watched David Letterman use a "monkey cam", Rotor devises a
Walrus Cam; actually, it's a small video camera that attaches to
his tool belt and which can send images back to Knothole.  The team
sans Sonic then heads out to deal with some approaching SWATbots,
only to be captured instead.  Meanwhile, in a special guest
appearance, Larry Lynx arrives in Knothole.  I came on board kind
of late so I missed his initial appearance.  But there's no way he
can miss Robotnik's visage on a monitor in Rotor's deserted hut. 
Before Larry suffers a full-blown panic attack, he spots something
on another monitor: a bunch of Mobians in training.  He heads out
there (don't ask me how he knows where to go to find them), and
runs into Sally's old team from her miniseries, along with another
one-shot creature making a cameo, Cyril the Eagle.  He puts some
SWATbots out of commission by relying on his jinx karma, which
doesn't seem to affect the other freedom fighters.  To make a short
story shorter, they liberate Sally and the others from the rocket. 
In gratitude, Sally promotes everyone to B-Team status with Larry
as leader.
     This is storytelling at its simplest: get from point A to
point B nice and easy (despite a few bumps along the way).  Art
Mawhinney's visuals are perfect as always.  The fact that Larry
came back for this one and has been promoted gives me reason to
hope that there MAY be a chance for the return of Fiona Fox.
     One further point about Art's drawings of Sally.  She's
looking good these days.  In one sense, that's a bad sign.  When
Mad Magazine did their parody of the film version of Erich Segal's
book "Love Story," they stated that the Ali McGraw character was
suffering from "old movie disease".  It's a condition where the
more beautiful you look, the closer to death you are.  By the time
the Ali character is in the hospital dying, "the color has come
back to her cheeks, the mascara has come back to her eyes, and her
teeth have all straightened!"  In a sense, Sally's beauty has
marked her for death.
     "Knuckles Quest 2"
     Story: Kent Taylor; Art: Pat Spaziante [presumably; the
credits sort of lump them together]
     In tracking down a lead in his search for the King's Sword,
Knuckles finds a remote hut in the Great Forest.  The owner, who
apparently doesn't believe in keeping a watchdog, instead keeps a
nasty one-eyed beastie called a Devil Watcher.  Knuckles tries
feeding him a felled tree, only to watch it disappear.  Other
security measures include two leopard-like Blood Beasts, a square-
jawed Berserker with bigger pecs than Dolly Parton, a Grim Reaper
and a dragon.  Knuckles decides to try thinking his way out of this
one based on the words of the Ancient Walkers from the previous
story.  Realizing that the one thing all these creatures have in
common is that they're characters from Mobian fairy tales, Knuckles
states outright that they're illusions and apologizes to his host
for intruding.  The creatures fade and Knuckles confronts the
resident, Merlin Prower.  Yes, there IS a family resemblance. 
Merlin identifies himself as a Charlatan, once in the service of
the King (and now presumably retired).  He says he doesn't know
where the Sword is, but suggests that the Knuckster try asking
someone in the Land of Dark, which doesn't appear on any AAA Trip-tiks.
     Fans have agreed that this is the best story in the issue, and
it's easy to see why.  They care about Knuckles getting the sword
if it'll help the King to recover.  And the fact that we're
introduced to someone who's an obvious relative of Tails is an
unbeatable hook.
     But does anybody else harbor a mistrust of Merlin?  He is,
after all, a charlatan.  Charlatans are by definition those who
claim to know more than they do.  By extension, he may not be
telling all that he DOES know.  Does anyone else expect to see
Merlin popping up later on, and in an unflattering light? 
Knuckles, given his unfamiliarity with the Knothole crew, unaware
of the surname "Prower", and not seeing the resemblance to Sonic's
friend Tails, doesn't make the connection.  That kind of monumental
cluelessness qualifies him to be a comic book publisher.

Sonic Blast Special #1
["Official Sega Game Adaptation!"]
     Once again, Spaziante favors us with a haunted cover.  In
this case, the ghost in question is Tails, who shows up
transparently on the left-hand side for no apparent reason.  In
fact, on the copy of the cover that appears in the ad opposite
the first "Find Your Name In Print" page, the image of Tails
doesn't show up at all!  The technique didn't help the Mecha
Madness cover and here, while intended to balance the composition
and give it some symmetry, it's simply a confusing add-on.  I
like the faux-reliefs of the Flickies, though.
     "Sonic Blast"
     Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
     Snively, still smarting from having been stripped of the key
to the executive washroom at the end of "The Death Egg Saga",
deliberately sabotages a transmission from Robotnik to make sure
that the Knothole gang can eavesdrop.  While Tails and Rotor head
for their respective submersibles, Sally takes the overland route
and arrives at the "harbor" first.  There, in a VERY nice 2-page 
drawing, Sonic is supposed to be kicking back and drowning worms. 
Instead, he admits to being miffed at Sally for changing her
story about her and Knuckles between "Triple Trouble" and "Mecha
Madness".  Freddy's editorial box could also have mentioned the
version in "Black and Blue and Red All Over" (#44) and gone on to
say: "Yeah, I know it's a plot inconsistency.  Hey,  we're making
this up as we go!  You rugrats got a problem with that?"  Anyway,
Mawhinney then favors us with a GREAT close-up sequence while
Gallagher shows that HE knows something about quoting from
movies, too.  The quote from Bogie and Bacall's "To Have And Have
Not" feels kinda forced, but goes extremely well with the extreme
close-up.  OK, multiple choice time:
     During the close-up Princess Sally is:
          A. Bending over Sonic
          B. Sitting next to Sonic
          C. Kneeling next to Sonic
          D. Straddling Sonic
[Note to Ken Penders: You've wondered out loud why nobody
commented on the third to last panel of "Last Game Cartridge
Hero", wondering if maybe you had been too subtle.  You have to
realize that Sonic fans are of two minds on this matter: either
they don't want to deal with "mush" or (as in the conclusion of
the "Doomsday Project" episode) they want to see Sonic and Sally
engaged in some serious tongue-wrestling!  Unless it's going to
go somewhere and build to something major, subtle doesn't make
it.]  Before we can get a definitive answer to the multiple
choice question, Rotor and Tails show up to make sure Archie
stays within the Comics Code guidelines.  Sonic comes on board
and the boys head off to Flickie Island.
     Welcome to Flickie Island!  No, that isn't your host, Mr.
Dork; it's Robotnik and the only R&R he's here for is "rob and
roboticize".  He demonstrates his scientific knowledge by saying
that the "flora and fauna bloom not with flowers, but with
precious gemstones."  I should HOPE that the fauna doesn't bloom;
unless you're a Chia Pet, animals can't grow much that blooms. 
Stick with the bots, Ivo!  The only local fauna, BTW, are the
terminally cute Flickie Birds (or is that "Flicky Birds"?).  In
addition to having those baby heads with the big, appealing eyes,
they have no natural enemies and are thus unafraid of strangers. 
So it's an easy matter for Robotnik (and they don't come any
stranger than him!) to roboticize them and begin scouring the
island for a Chaos Emerald.
     As our guys arrive offshore, Tails takes to the air to
intercept what he thinks is a flock of friendlies.  However, the
Flickiebots don't treat him any better than the Wing Dingoes did
in "Southern Crossover" and he dives into the drink.  Which is
actually pretty fortunate because the sea water serves to
deroboticize the birdies.  Tails is pulled aboard Rotor's
bathysphere where he puts one hand behind his head in a weird
gesture.  That hand CAN'T belong to Sonic because HIS right hand
is leaning on the bathysphere.  Unless Sonic has grown a second
right arm when I wasn't looking.  Or maybe Tails is trying to dry
himself off by doing the Macarena.  For the record, Bill Mauldin
once drew a cartoon for "Stars and Stripes" showing three guys
and SEVEN HANDS clearly visible.  You're in good company, Art.
[Yet another note to Ken Penders: If you do subtle and it doesn't
work, you'll soon discover that everybody's an art critic!].
     After an implausible bit of business to confirm the effects
of sea water on Flickiebots [I'm sorry, no matter how fast Sonic
was working, the only kind of water that can act that way within
the realities of molecular chemistry is the kind of water you get
when the outdoor temperature drops below 32 degrees Fahrenheit],

RDB note: plus an elapsed time of .0000000000001 milliseconds = 10^-13 ms
= 10^-7 nanoseconds, and light travels at 1 foot/ns, and if that "water 
ball" travelled 20 feet, it was therefore moving at 200 million times the 
speed of light; I don't think so...

Sonic leaves Rotor and Tails to deal with the Flickiebot flock
while he skitters to shore.  They arm themselves with
supersoakers and Gallagher risks incurring the wrath of
leathernecks everywhere with that "Semper Fi" gag.
     We take our leave of the birdbath sequence and follow Sonic
inland.  With the aid of a Flickie Bird, he comes across Robotnik
as he discovers a Ring/"dimensional portal".  After about three
pages of toing and froing 

RDB note: during which Sonic only moves at _twice_ light speed; I just 
dropped a quasi-troll in a.f.sh wondering who was faster: Sonic or The 
Flash?

wherein Sonic gives Robotnik a wedgie
(actually, the more I think about it, the more in-character it
seems), Robotnik jumps into the Ring with Sonic right behind him.
     The following two pages I'll have to assume are an accurate
representation of the relevant level in the game.  Nice artwork
by Mawhinney in the service of crass commercialism.  

RDB note: er, as crass as the same thing in the "Sonic Look and Find" book?

And someone will have to explain that "Is this the end of Rico?" gag to me.

RDB note: "Ricochet Rabbit"?

     Anyway, just when it looks like Sonic has got this thing all
wrapped up, he finds himself wrapped up in Robotnik's cape as the
Big Guy goes after the Chaos Emerald.  He finds it in the head of
a giant stone Flickie Bird which COMES ALIVE when the stone is
removed.  As Ivo Robotnik wonders if Indiana Jones ever had days
like this, Sonic has a bad case of deja vu.  He's been there and
done that when a Zone collapses.  Giving himself a case of the
shakes, he manages to bust out of the cape 

RDB note: just like The Flash would've done...

and escape the Flickie
Zone before it collapses.  Robotnik manages to escape as well,
but the emerald disappeared down a Flickie Bird's gullet.  

RDB note: huh?  All that's implied is the bird bit Robotnik's hand to get 
him to drop the gem...

He further discovers that the Flickiebots have all been
deroboticized, the roboticizer he brought to the island has been
smashed by Tails and Rotor, and the exoskeletal battlesuit that
got trashed in the Zone was what got him there in the first
place.  Well, it hasn't been his day, his week, his month
or...hey, you know how the tune goes!
     I'll be the first to admit that I approached this issue with
a certain amount of fear and loathing.  I thought the story idea
would be too slight and that the end-result would be nothing but
a glorified print ad for the game cart.  I've never been so happy
to have been proven wrong.  This story worked for me!  The
narrative was strong and devoid of puns in favor of actual humor,
so mush so that it was easy to forgive some of the lapses like
the business with the waterball.  This is Gallagher's best work
to date, even eclipsing "Rage Against The Machine" which I HAD
thought his strongest.  And Mawhinney's artwork is as great as
ever, even with that ambiguous hand bit on page 10.  And I don't
know if the Flickies are depicted here as they exist in the game,
but they are a rare bird indeed: minor characters who have great
breakout potential.  I don't know who gets the credit for their
design, but the more I look at them the more I can see that the
four basic Flickies might each plausibly possess well-defined
personalities (despite their limited vocabularies).  My favorite
is the lavender Flickie with the "pigtails", BTW.  Brilliant, and
a good reason to double-bag this one!
     Sonic Blast: What A Blast! -- I suppose one of the perks of
working in the comics industry is getting to test-fly a game if
you're going to adapt it.  Don't rub it in, Fred.  Another plug
for the outsides and the insides of "Knuckles: The Dark Legion". 
I'm a little more interested in Knuckles bio than I am in the
cover art.  And #45 features the return of Mobie (so what?) and
the continuation of Knuckles' Quest.  We also see Sonic and
Geoffrey comparing dental plans on the cover of #46, and get an
(unexplained) sneak at part of the cover of #47.

RDB note: I missed that the first time around; as I'll comment in my 
comments on #45, it didn't include _any_ upcoming covers, let alone 47's...

     "The T.U.F.F. Awards"
     Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Dave Manak
     I would have described this as "two pages worth of running
in place" but that would have implied that those concerned
actually worked up a sweat in the course of getting this done. 
It's a knock-off, pure and simple, something to fill two pages. 
The writing is a no-brainer.  Ever since "Court Martial" Dave
Manak has proved that he can do sustained artwork with a measure
of quality; this stuff, though, reminds me of a _Mad Magazine_
Don Martin parody of Art Mawhinney's style. Sally had the right
idea: pull the plug!
     Find Your Name In Print x 4: "Moronic" Melody Hillard?  
     "Bugged Bunny"
     Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Dave Manak
     OK, when the first panel features Robotnik and Snively
dressed up like they want to audition for the Waltz Of The
Flowers, you get an idea of the tone.  The plot itself isn't such
a travesty--the two slip a homing device on the sleeping Bunnie
expecting her to lead them to Knothole--but it's played for
slapstick all the way.  Likable if you're into that sort of
thing.  Wake me up for the Dance Of The Fertilizer Fairy.
     Fan Art And Then Some: Ever since the fan art section in #44
with a Pepto-pink female fox, I've supposed that it was for
Archie's benefit that they accepted only black-and-white
submissions.  Nice to see that they've gotten with the program
and then some!  Favorites: Kelly Griner's drawing of Sally and
Aura Moser's envelope art.  As for Ginger Hartman's envelope art,
too bad Archie couldn't have enlarged it a bit--it's a bear
trying to read those word balloons!  Speaking of bears, head for
the hills  cause Mobie's back in town.  Personally, I'd rather
commune with a Care Bear!

#45 [April 1997]
     Spaz cover: A prophetic cover by Spaz.  Notice all the munitions 
in the background?  Keep them in mind while you're reading this bomb.
     "Guerrilla Thriller"
     Story: Angelo DeCesare; Art: Dave Manak
     Since I get the Sonic comics later than most on this list,
I've had a chance to read some early comments on some issues when
they've been posted.  Early returns on "Guerrilla Thriller" have
led me to ask myself: "Good grief, just how bad IS this thing?"
     It's that bad.  Worse.  Let's say right out of the box that
the art is some of the worst I've ever seen ANYWHERE.  But let's
try to look past that and summarize the plot:
     After a one-page recap of Mobie's introduction, we lose sight
of him for seven pages, during which the reader can pause and give
thanks.  An off-model Uncle Chuck overhears Robotnik and
an off-model Snively plotting to establish a command center in the
"Mobian Jungle".  Because Robotnik has a serious phobia about the
jungle, Snively suggests a scorched-earth device called the "Eco-
Destroyer" which sounds like something he got at a Captain Planet
garage sale.  Uncle Chuck delivers the news to the Freedom Fighters
in Knothole.  Carefully study the two center panels on page 3,
particularly the arms on Bunnie and Uncle Chuck.  Is it me or are
their forearms somewhat larger than their upper arms?  This is
straight out of Popeye Physiology 101!  Sorry, I had promised not
to digress and talk about the so-called artwork of this story.  It
ain't easy.  The Knothole gang splits up in groups of two to warn
the jungle dwellers.
     Once in the jungle Sonic and Rotor come upon a bunch of rare
narcolyptus berries.  Unfortunately Sonic had already sampled the
strange fruit and was thus rendered "hors de combat" as Antoine
would say.  The fact that we've just come upon something that can
slow Sonic down is the ONLY redeeming feature of the plot.  Anyway,
Rotor is the only one awake when look-alike gorillas (wardrobe
courtesy of Rambo's of Beverly Hills) jump them.
     Rotor is set to work in the gorillas' jungle compound doing double 
duty in Weapons R&D as well as in the mess hall.  Sonic tries making a
deal, offering to give them military hardware in exchange for their
freedom.  He thinks he can pawn off some of their own stockpile of
weapons as new stuff.  But the scam doesn't work any better for
Sonic than it did for the Mobians who tried it in my fanfic "Space
Case" [Whoa! Plot gridlock!] Busted!
     Once again under lock and key, Sonic and Rotor are interrupted
by a gorilla stampede as the great apes hot-foot it out of the
compound upon the approach of the Eco-Destroyer.  Snively shows up
wearing a lampshade on his head.  Just then reinforcements show up
in the form of Tails, Bunnie, and the alleged hero of this spiel,
Mobie.  The gorillas who didn't run away are fast asleep since
Rotor had spiked their rations with narcolyptus berries...hmmmm,
didn't I see that plot twist in a Mr. Peabody cartoon?  Anyway,
before Snively can fire up the device, Tails flies up to the
control room to distract him.  

RDB note: with a standard but still amusing "nyah" face...

Sonic, meanwhile, has "loosened a few thousand screws and bolts" with 
a handy crescent wrench which just happens to be the right size!  

RDB note: actually, it was a combination wrench; 
a Crescent (TM, R) wrench is _adjustable_...

The Eco-Destroyer falls apart, the gorillas apologize and the reader 
is glad it's over.
     I can just imagine the story conference at Archie for this
one: "Let's see, we still need a cover story for #45.  I know we're
just marking time until "Endgame" but let's set up the readers
emotionally for Sally's death.  Now the hardcores over on the Net
have been saying all along that the very idea of killing off Sally
is ugly, stupid, and pointless.  Let's see...ugly, stupid, and
pointless.  Hey!  Let's do another story about Mobie!  You remember
Mobie, the cave whatsis?  But we're under deadline here.  Angelo,
you've got thirty minutes to write it.  Dave, you've got 30 minutes
to do the art and Jay Oliveras will do the inking.  Spaz, you've
got an hour to do the cover.  We'll just have to fax everything to
the printers up in Canada and hope that those boneheads don't turn
everybody orange this time!"
     If they HAD misprinted it and turned everybody orange, it
probably would have made for a more entertaining piece.  This thing
is a mess!  The inking looks awful -- way too thin in spots, as if
some of the ink was erased along with the pencil roughs.  Whether
Dave was in a hurry or whether the Dave and Jay team just doesn't
work is debatable.  The story is basic enough to fill sixteen
pages, but feels just as slap-dash as the artwork.  The first comic
of the year and already we have a serious contender for Worst
Single Issue Story and Art for 1997.  A kid could do a better job! 
How's THAT for a segue to...
     Fan Art: If it weren't for what's going to happen with #47,
I'd suggest to Archie that they get someone on the next flight to
Barcelona and sign up Eva Richarte Prieto at once!  Not only does
she do a VERY on-model Bunnie (more so than most other artists) but
her drawing of Sally is simply GREAT!  I wonder whether even
Mawhinney could pull off that particular blend of cuteness and
sexiness.  If I knew anything about Web pages and scanning, I'd get
that picture of Sally on there in a heartbeat.
     Find Your Name: the usual.
     "Knuckles Quest 3: A Land of Dark, A Knight of Virtue"
     Story: Ken Penders and Kent Taylor; Art: Ken Penders
     After failing to find the King's sword at the home of Merlin
Prower the Charlatan, we find Knuckles performing menial labor for 
a shapely female rabbit.  Must've seemed like a smart career move
at the time.  Actually, the change is so abrupt that Ken & Kent
need TWO PAGES of exposition to fill us in--and when your story is
only eight pages to begin with, you can appreciate how much has
gone on since our last visit.  Quick recap: met the Ancient Walkers
(who are now merely disembodied masks), dead end at Merlin's, quick 
acknowledgment of "Black and Blue..." (#44), enlisted the aid of the
Chaotix before being captured by the Sorcerer (a black cat,
possibly the one named Hershey who's threatening to become a series
regular) and the aforementioned Enchantress.  Those of us with
dirty minds can gaze at the last panel on page 4 and speculate as
to what other kinds of "tasks" the Enchantress may have made
Knuckles perform.  OK, that's enough of that.  Then comes an entire
page where Knuckles does...NOTHING.  Well, nothing on his own,
anyway.  The action resumes on page 6 when the horse-faced Paladin,
"Sir Connery", storms the castle.  And what do you wanna bet someone
on the writing staff was watching a video of "First Knight" when
they came up with THAT uninspired name?  One flash from a magic
sword and Knuckles is free of the spell of the Enchantress, which
allows him to duel with the Sorcerer using equal parts cleverness
and brawling.  I'll spare you Sir C's exposition, except to say
that his sword is NOT the king's sword; to stay on the path for
THAT piece of cutlery, he tells Knuckles to find Mathias Poe (the
raven wizard--like anyone who's taken American Lit couldn't have
figured that one out!) and Damocles the Elder (who by process of
elimination has to be the goat-headed Alchemist).  They're supposed
to be back on the Floating Island's "other caverns filled with
chaos".  OK, Knuckles, click the heels of your sneakers together
and say: "There's no place like home, there's no place like home...."
     I swear, I really wanted to LIKE this one.  The encounter with
Merlin was a perfect set-up.  But we've got more mystical
archetypes, more dead ends, and way too much mumbo-jumbo by this
point.  In trying to make the series their own by cutting it adrift
from the DiC set-up, I'm afraid Ken & Kent are going out too far on
a long, thin limb.  I'd like to know if any of the other readers
even CARE about these new characters; I sure don't.  Except for
Merlin, and then only because I care enough about Tails to want to
know what the connection is between the two.  These characters are
as stiff and two-dimensional as the cards in a "Magic: The 
Gathering..." deck.  I know, I know, Ken and Kent only had 8
pages to play around with.  It's still a bad sign when you expect 
archetypes to substitute for characters who have actual
personalities: Hershey is a total cipher, The Enchantress seems
like an off-the-rack ice maiden, and Sir Connery is just a generic
Good Guy whose lines could have been scripted for Dudley Do-Right! 
The story arc isn't over and already I'm getting tired of it.  I
finished the story with a feeling of: "Let's find the danged sword
and move on to new business!"  And that's no way to hold readers.
     Sonic-Grams: Fred plugs the Dark Legion again and pumps #46 in
EXTREMELY heavy-duty prose.  All this talk about "heated
confrontations concerning each other's loyalties" makes it sound
like a drama scripted by Edward Albee or Tennessee
Williams.  I only hope they don't screw around with the Wolf Pack
too badly.  Jared Matte raves about #39 ("Rage Against The
Machine"), and Justin Barrett sticks up for Knuckles and "Mecha
Madness".  Long-time Netster Ruby the Echidna gets a word in on
"Notes From The Net."  As the days dwindle down to a precious few....

Sonic Quest Mini-Series, issues #1 - #3
     Spaz ghost cover for #1.  I FINALLY caught on that the
figure in green is supposed to be King Acorn.
     Sonic Quest #1: "Ordering: One Death Egg scrambled!  And may
the Force be with us!"
     Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Manny Galan
     Did I miss something in the three months I've been waiting
to see this issue?  I've never heard the term "renegade" applied
to Geoffrey St. John before.  "Useless bit player" is more
applicable, especially considering his part in "The Dream Zone"
(#43).  Anyway, the aforementioned renegade/UBP gets a rude
reception from the brown-eyed blue blur because Geoff was trying
to sneak into Knothole before Princess Sally could show up with
his visitor's pass.  Inside one of the huts King Acorn is in a
bad state since his rescue from the Zone/Void/Whatever.  There
follows a one-page recap of quite a few story lines, some of them
best forgotten even by Ken Penders' admission, from "The Fall of
Robotropolis", through "Rage Against The Machine/Mecha
Madness/Court Martial" and ending with "And One Shall Save Him". 
And as Freddy himself admitted, THIS story won't have an impact
on anything to come.  So why are we here?  Who knows?  Let's just
get this over with.
     Geoffrey goes and stands at the front door.  THAT'S HIS
ENTIRE CONTRIBUTION TO THE WHOLE DANG MINISERIES!  He does less 
here than he did in "The Dream Zone".  He doesn't even appear in
the reaction shot at the end of SonicQuest #3 when the Death Egg
is destroyed -- like I'm spoiling it for anyone when I tell you THAT!  
     And a little fox shall lead them: Tails is apparently the
only one in Knothole with enough of a grasp of the obvious to
note the resemblance between the King's crystalline state and the
Chaos Emeralds.  This is such a revelation that the news
momentarily straightens out Bunnie's perpetually lopped ear. 
Sonic tries exposing the King to that Billionth Ring he got in
"Ring of Truth" (#35) with less than desirable results.  Still,
Rotor seems to think that more of the same should help -- only
this time, check the freshness date.
     Can we pause here and talk about Manny Galan's artwork? 
Maybe we'd better not, in case there are any small children
around.  Page 8 is a mess!  The top panel looks like the inside
of a funhouse: the perspective is shot, the characters are off-
model, and the full-figure Sally at the bottom of the page looks
like it was inked by someone other than the person who inked the
Sally at the top of the page.  After yet more plot synopses from
previous stories, the Freedom Fighters get their orders: Bunnie
and Antoine go on vacation and don't reappear in the story, Sally
and Rotor stay behind for an odd interlude in SQ#2, and that
leaves Sonic and Tails to carry the story.
     As for the villain of this melodrama, despite a Patrick
Stewart quotation, the only thing Robotnik has in common with
Jean-Luc Picard is the same hairline.  He leaves an off-model
Snively behind while he goes off to take care of business.  For
his part, Snively immediately starts slacking off -- apparently
taking his lead from Geoffrey St. John.
     Sonic and Tails arrive at the ring grotto featured in the
Super Sonic v. Hyper Knuckles special, the one that was
supposedly imploded when Sonic and Knuckles did a serious head
butt.  Only now the aforementioned grotto is covered by a metal
dome.  For no logical reason, Sonic thinks that Carl Condor who
lives in the mountains to the west may know something about this
development.  He leaves Tails and runs off to check in with Carl.
     The last time we were here, we were treated to the sight of
Princess Sally on all fours in what for animals can only be
described as a sexually receptive position (though seen from a
"safe" angle) delivering that deathless line to Sonic and
Knuckles: "Don't be shy, boys!  Take a look down here!"  So now 
Tails can only watch in horror as the mound-like dome spreads
apart and a giant tube drops down from the sky and inserts itself
suggestively into the grotto.  The entire sequence has all the
subtlety and Freudian symbolism of a train entering a tunnel. 
Too bad Sonic and Sally will never marry: this grotto would be
the perfect place for them to spend their honeymoon.
     OK, let's move on before this gets any nastier.  Tails
watches as the tube sucks up rings from the grotto.  He tries to
make a break for it, but due to some premature withdrawal 

RDB note: what was that about not getting nastier?

by the tube he gets sucked up along with some of the surrounding
landscape.  Sonic, meanwhile, finds nothing but nothing in the
western landscape.    As for Carl, he shows up as a roboticized
condorbot.  Carl apparently makes short work of Sonic and begins
bearing him aloft to the Death Egg, which looks like an egg-
shaped Death Star with two parabolic dishes (a double yolker?). 
Robotnik, however, is cheesed off that the tube sucked up so much
of the Mobian landscape that the ship is carrying too much
weight.  He punches out the SWATbot responsible and sends the bot
down the garbage chute (remember that bot -- he'll figure in the
plot later).  Robotnik then heads for the control room, with the
standard equipment of fuzzy dice and 8-ball stick shift.  I'm
sure that if Galan could have figured out a way to include a bare
foot accelerator pedal and Yosemite Sam "Back Off!" mud flaps he
would have.  And the camera pulls away to reveal the Death Egg in
all its cliched glory.  Oh, I'm so scared.
     Back up one page for the Fan Art section.  Nice drawing by
Tara Holcraft of Princess Sally in a full-length gown.  I wonder
how Tara is at drawing shrouds?  
     Letter Quest: So how come there AREN'T any letters?  There
ARE, however, covers for SonicQuest #2 and #3, Sonic Live (they
say " #1" but considering the reception it got I think it's safe
to say "#only"), and Sonics #43 and 44.  Freddy warns us to
"expect the unexpected".  Fred, you don't know the half of it!

     [Note: Before proceeding with the plot synopsis, we will now turn 
this review over to two representatives of the Canadian printing industry]:
     "Good day, I'm Bob McKenzie.  This is my brother, Doug."
     "How's it goin', eh?"
     "And we're here to talk aboot what happened when the Death
Egg Saga #2 got printed, eh?"
     "Yah, what happened dere?  How come Sonic's like all purple, eh?"
     "OK, like, what happened was what's called oversaturation."
     "That's when you've had too many brews, eh?"
     "Take off, ya hoser!"
     "I took a look at page 1 and I thought *I* was oversaturated."
     "We're not talkin' aboot you, we're talkin' aboot the printing, eh?"
     "So how come it looks so bad, eh?"
     "OK, here's the deal.  It's kinda like when you've bean screwin' 
aroond with the tint control on the TV, eh?  And you pushed the red too far."
     "It was dat cheap universal remote ya got.  The buttons stick, eh?"
     "They stick because you keep spilling your Molson's on the remote, eh?"
[Sounds of a scuffle]
     We apologize to any Canadians reading this review for the
preceding explanation of why the colors on certain pages of #2
(which was printed in The Great White North) got jazzed. 
Basically, in the 4-color printing process used to print the
comic, the red value was twice what it should have been.  Because
of a tight schedule, the error wasn't found until too late and it
shipped in that condition.  So anyway...

     Sonic Quest #2.  "Ordering!  One poached Death Egg with a plot rehash!"
     Is it me, or has Manny Galan's artwork improved dramatically
since the first installment?  Must be taking Spaziante lessons. 
Robotnik, unaware that Snively has been busy living off the
expense account instead of rebuilding "my beloved megaopolis"
[the word is "megalopolis", gang, but what's one more mistake in
this issue?], checks in to report that having used the power
rings to build the Death Egg's defenses, he needs a Chaos Emerald
to adequately power the contraption.  He also needs to lose some
dead weight in order to gain proper altitude; instead of
switching to lo-cal soda, he decides to dump the debris from the
grotto that got sucked up.  However, part of that debris is
tawny-colored and has two tails.  Tails climbs into the disabled
SWATbot that Robotnik punched out in the previous issue to work
it from the inside, dumps the debris (keep an eye on that stuff -- 
it'll be important to the plot) and reports to Robotnik.
     As for Sonic, the off-blue blur is still being borne aloft
by the Condorbot, which turns out to be as talkative as a parrot. 
Thanks to some exposition between Botnik and the bot, Sonic gets
caught up on the plot and the hedgehog stops playing possum.  He
tries fighting the Condorbot but is clearly at a disadvantage
until the purged debris drops on top of the bot from above (Told
ya to watch for that stuff).  Using a maneuver I still haven't
gotten the hang of (I'll admit it -- I've never gotten to the end
of Stage Two of the Jungle Sequence of Sonic 1 for Game Gear),

RDB note: nor read many Flash comics?  :^)

Sonic manages to get himself inside the Egg.  Unfortunately, his
communicator can't pull in anything from inside there; I've owned
radios like that myself.
     Strange Interlude: we cut to Knothole when Sally learns from
Nicole that the King's condition is unknown and worsening.  Rotor
informs Sally that Sonic and Tails haven't reported back, and
Sally lets the stress get to her by crying on Rotor's shoulder. 
Hang on a minute, I want to check something...Yep, it still says
"Mike Gallagher" wrote this story, though this single page is
much stronger than his usual work (mercifully).  I think he's
getting the hang of this!  And Galen's drawings of Sally are
pretty darned amazing.  Spaziante's influence REALLY shows. Nice
tail!  She's also got a great bootie.
     From the sublime to the ridiculously obese: Tails, still
wearing his SWATbot costume, realizes that Robotnik is headed
toward the Floating Island.  So does Knuckles, as the Death Egg
does a Kilroy over the clouds on the approach.  Knux, however,
gets zapped as he approaches the ship, but the Chaotix are
waiting for him down below.  Robotnik then launches two large
"Burrobots" which look a lot like giant versions of Grounder from
the syndicated TV series.  The two bots clank off in search of
the Chaos Emeralds, but Archimedes has already figured that out. 
So Knux and the crew go after the bots in what WOULD have been an
impressive two-page spread if only they'd gotten the colors right.
     Once outside of the burning building....  Sorry, that was
how an infamous chapter of a Nancy Drew mystery began.  She went
from trapped inside the building at the end of the previous
chapter to outside at the beginning of the next with NO account
of how she got there.  Gallagher sort of follows in the same
footsteps by having Sonic declare that he's worked his way "up
the levels" to the control room.  Page limitations, I suppose. 
But it's compensated by a VERY complex plot situation at the
bottom of page 18: Robotnik getting ready to attack the Floating
Island with Tails/SWATbot inching out of the control room not
noticing Sonic who unaware that the SWATbot is his little bro in
disguise prepares to trash to SWATbot!  Whew!  That's a
cliffhanger ending right there!  But on we go as the Death Egg
tries pushing the Floating Island into the sea, attempting to
overcome the "prodigous" [Hey, Fred, you need a proofreader?]
power of the Chaos Emerald.  Robotnik pushes all systems to 150%
and turns the amplifiers up to 11.  He succeeds in tilting the
island so that Knuckles slides off, glides away and gets a look at 
the Floating Island being turned into landfill.  Not if HE can help it!
     Letter-Quest: a couple hints about #3, which is coming right
up.  Also plugs for "Sonic Live!" and #43.  "Find Your Name" and
Fan Art pages are oversaturated but it only partly ruins some
fine art this time around, especially a very manga-esque
rendering of Sally auditioning for a new gig in anticipation of
her getting killed off here.  
     Sonic Quest #3:"Ordering: Death Egg Over Easy and not a
moment too soon!  And easy on the rehash!"
     Look out, old Manny is back.  And I mean the OLD Manny who
couldn't draw worth beans.  For your consideration, please look
at pages 2 and 3.  Now tell me with a straight face that Sonic
doesn't have the EXACT SAME FACIAL EXPRESSION IN ALL NINE TIMES
HE'S USED!  Sure, there are subtle variations: Sonic with his
mouth closed, Sonic with his eyes opened wider.  But it's the
same face!  This is stupid!  NOBODY can lose it THIS fast, not
after the superior artwork seen in #2 (notwithstanding the color
snafu).  And Manny's subsequent lame artwork for "The Dream Zone"
(#43) only confirms my suspicions.  Did the change in inkers from
SQ#2 (Jim Amash and Jay Oliveras) to SQ#3 (Harvo and Jay
Oliveras) make THAT much of a difference?  I had to wonder
whether, under deadline pressures, Spaziante didn't "lend a hand"
and do some of the pencilling while letting Galen take the
credit.  That's the only other explanation I can come up with. 
But the gang at Archie would NEVER do anything so unethical,
would they?  ("Excuse me, Freddy, Newt Gingrich is calling you
from his cell phone on line two.").
     OK, so much for the artwork, let's get to the plot.  Sonic
gets to rough up the SWATbot a bit before realizing that Tails is
inside.  As Sonic heads for Robotnik, we realize why he just sat
there while Sonic and Tails had their exposition: he's sealed off
by plexiglass.  Enclosing Sonic, he begins pumping poison gas
into Sonic's chamber.  The suspense mounts as we look at a full-
page ad for adulterated yogurt on the facing page.  

RDB note: you know what the problem with yogurt is?  
How do you know when it goes bad?  :^)

Tails, however, busts through a wall using the SWATbot bod and then
opens fire with the bot's blasters.  He not only manages to free
Sonic but he also cuts out the downward thrusters.  Newton's
third law kicks in as Robotnik makes yet another escape.  On the
Floating Island, there's quite a bit of grandiose posing and
dialogue from Knuckles who admits (in passing) that he "caught a
break".  So having not accomplished anything in this saga except
to help bust up the Burrobots and despite his "equal billing" on
the cover of #3 with Sonic, his part is over and aside from a
lousy reaction shot at the end he gets to collect his paycheck. 
Gotta do something about these "pay or play" contracts.
     OK, here's where I have to defer to those who know the games
better than I do.  Robotnik goes to his backup, about whom I
don't know anything: Silver Sonic.  Looks impressive; fights
stupid.  Knocks Sonic into a wall, giving Sonic the opportunity
to use a couple live wires to short him out.  Hmmm, 3 pages --
about the length of some of Mike Tyson's recent bouts.  OK, so
Buttnik goes to the backup's backup: some body armor called the
"Eggs-O-Skeleton".  Looks like the old Gallagher is back in town
as well.  This ploy doesn't hold up either since Sonic has taken
a cue from Tails and climbed into the Silver Sonic to "extend
himself" for Robotnik's benefit.  They duke it out for a few
pages and I can't help but think of Siguorney Weaver operating
that cargo hauler in "Aliens II" and giving the critter a taste
of kung fu.  They battle their way into the room where Tails
waits to deliver the deathless line: "I rigged the Death Egg to
explode in twenty minutes, but your battle with Robotnik has
damaged so many internal systems, it could ignite at any moment." 
And all without using the Owner's Manual (see "How To Rig The
Death Egg To Explode In Twenty Minutes", page 817).  He later
speaks of "the antimatter matrix reach[ing] the nucleonic
dispersion chamber"; hey Poindexter, you swallow a dictionary for
breakfast?  It's understandable as technobabble goes, but not too
plausible coming from Tails.  On their way out, our heroes just
happen to pass a "magic ring junction box" -- all together now:
"GEE, WHAT ARE THE ODDS?"  They make a jump for it, Sonic
jettisons the Silver suit and the Death Egg goes the way of the
Death Star(s).  Not that it does any good: the rings fail to cure
the King and Robotnik escapes to fight another day, after
auditing Snively's books.
     What can you say about this story with a straight face?  The
artwork was some of the most inconsistent around.  It started
bad, got better, then went to bad again.  And the story was a
muddle. Gallagher threw in too many characters who ended up doing
nothing, and some of what the others ended up doing just wasn't
up to par.  Sonic's whole "worked his way up the levels" angle in
#2 was hack writing at its worst.  At least Gallagher got his act
together to a surprising degree for the Sonic Blast special.
     But perhaps the most objectionable aspect was the one Freddy
was up-front about: that this story accomplished about as much as
Geoffrey did as a glorified doorman.  OK, Robotnik gets defeated
again; like nobody could have guessed that THAT was going to
happen!  That particular punch was telegraphed by the MISuse of
the Death Egg device.  Yes, "misuse".  At least in the Star Wars
film, they used the Death Star to destroy Alderaan and give the
viewer an idea of what the gang was up against.  Such a waste of
paper and time, all capped off by the oversaturation of #2.  In
some ways, it's kind of symbolic...though not NEARLY as symbolic
as the grotto sequence in #1!
     Letter-Quest: Thanks to all those who did/didn't deserve it. 
Plug for #44 and the return of Evil Sonic with an Evil Knuckles
as well in what's beginning to shape up to be the recurring
Bizarro World for this series.  And at the end of December,
"Sonic Blast #1: It's the official comic adaptation of [i.e.,
it's the Glorified Print Advertisement for] the game with the
very same name."  Also covers for #45 (Mobie returns) and #46
(Sonic and Geoffrey arm-wrestling or something).  The "Find Your
Name" page includes readers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
Tasmania (technically part of Australia) and Singapore.  That
means that Sally's demise will be an international tragedy.  The
fan art page features some manga-inspired humor with Bunnie
having egg problems of her own as an Easter bunny, along with a
nice landscape of Knothole.  I've already commented upon the
drawing of Sally playing the field before Ken tells her to hit
the road.  From a great height.

RDB note: speaking of which, would somebody download the cover for #47 from 
AOL and e-mail it to me or put it on a web site as Ken said they could 
(with the appropriate copyright disclaimer) in his interview?  Thanks!

#46 [May 1997]
Spaz/Harvo cover: EXTREME CLOSE-UP!!  My, what big egos...er, teeth
you have.  All the better to chew the scenery with.

     "Countdown to Armageddon"
     Story: Ken Penders and Kent Taylor; Art: Nelson Ortega
     Based on the spoilers that have already been posted about this
story, I formed the preliminary conclusion that the opening
sequence (how Uncle Chuck roboticized Sonic's father) was a good
premise wasted on the wrong story.  Now that I've seen the sequence
for myself, I've revised my opinion: this is a GREAT premise wasted
on the wrong story!  Ortega's artwork is surprisingly strong, and
the pacing is a jolt.  As to the identity of the hedgehog being
roboticized, only a clueless newbie would miss the following hints:
     a) The look.  And no, I DON'T believe all hedgehogs look alike.
     b) The talk.  Uncle Chuck's use of the possessive pronoun "MY
brother" removes all doubt as to who's in that chamber there.
     c) Relativity.  Charles is Sonic's uncle.  That means that
Sonic is the son either of Charles's sister or brother.  Since this
is the only mention ever of a sibling for Charles, we have to
assume that the metal Sonic in question is indeed Sonic's father.
     So, having established that, identify the following clueless newbies:
     "Where's the popcorn?"
     "That is way past cool...how ya doing it?"
     "Do you have a dish antennae [sic] with a hundred movie stations?"
     "This would be a perfect time for one of my special military retreats."
     Yes, we're talking about the Knothole Freedom Fighters: Tails,
Sonic, Dulcy, and the soon-to-be late Princess Sally.  That last
one really galls me.  I've done enough writing for Sally in my
fanfic to have a feel for her character, and she's not that
clueless!  One of the first things out of her mouth should have
been something to the effect of "I didn't know you had a brother,
Uncle Chuck."  

RDB note: uh, then why would Sonic have called him "Uncle Chuck"?

Everybody else doesn't even comment on the
situation!  The whole angle drops straight down the same memory
hole that's swallowed so many bad plots and angles before.
     Ken Penders, speaking in his own defense on this point, has
stated that the last time he tried introducing a similar angle in
the Sally miniseries concerning Sally's mother, he was promptly
slapped down by Sega, probably by some business school grad whose
only experience with creative writing involves submitting expense
account reports.  Since then Ken's admitted to being more
circumspect in introducing controversial plot angles.  All well and
good, but better that the issue should never have been raised at
all than the Knothole characters end up behaving like actors in a
movie with an Idiot Plot.
     For those of you unfamiliar with the term, film critic Roger
Ebert coined the phrase "Idiot Plot" to denote any motion picture
where the action can only proceed according to the story line if
all the actors are complete idiots.  Slasher films are prime
examples of Idiot Plot movies.  Everybody KNOWS about the serial
killer lurking in the woods around Camp Whatchamacallit, but
there's always a group of idiot teenagers who have to follow the
Idiot Plot outline and head on up to the camp because it's the
perfect make-out spot.  Why?  Because if they DIDN'T act like
idiots -- if it occurred to them that looking for another venue or
maybe going bowling would be a better idea -- the movie would be
over.  So a fantastic angle turns into a waste of space because the
right story isn't going to be told.
     We now rejoin the cast of "Clueless in the Great Forest." 
Sally's idea of a retreat is not to run away; rather, it's more
like a camp-out than a bug-out.  But instead of singing a couple
choruses of the Mobian equivalent of "Kumbaya", we're treated to
more self-criticism from Uncle Chuck.  He continues to avoid the
question he himself raised in the beginning, instead giving a brief
resume of his official duties in an effort by Ken and Kent to meld
the DiC Canon with the Archie Received Version (not entirely
successfully; Dic has never even HINTED that Uncle Chuck was ever
a short-order cook.  That was the version quoted in the original
4-issue series).  And while he was in the process of confessing his
sins, why didn't Uncle Chuck mention what it was like to be a
single parent to Sonic?  Ken and Kent manage to avoid that angle
entirely, but how many of you reading this would like to know THAT
story?  Show of hands, please.  I thought so.
     Enter mystery guest and sign in please: yes, after way too
long, one of the few guest characters of the cartoon series to
really make an impression finally puts in an appearance in the
comic: it's Lupee, accompanied by several members of the Wolf Pack. 
(Note: I prefer spelling it "Lupee" until I can figure out a way to
insert a grave diacritical mark above the "e").  

RDB note: there's probably some high-ASCII character that does it, but I 
wouldn't use it anyway...  How about Lupe'?

After a white wolf
named Drago (impressive but the name screws up the Native American
motif of the Wolf Pack entirely) mentions a new kind of bot under
development, he begins casting aspersions on Uncle Chuck by
accusing him of being a spy for Robotnik.  Sonic tries to defend
his kin but the accusation is second[ed] by yet another mystery guest:
Geoffrey St. John.  Since his debut in "Deadliest of the Species"
when he was mysteriously heroic and suave, he seems to have
undergone a personality transplant.  Unfortunately, the donor must
have been a total jerk.  His first act is to start sucking on
Sally's face...well, it doesn't look like a kiss to me, Nelson. 
His gratuitous mention of the competitor's product ("This isn't a
GAME, BOY!) earns him a well-deserved punch in the mouth from
Sonic.  He retaliates by firing some kind of bolo that binds Sonic
to a tree.  Before he can reprise his attempt in "And One Shall
Save Him" to put a crossbow bolt through Sonic's head, we pause for
the Fan Art and Find Your Name pages.  Matt Burt's drawing of Sonic
and Tails wearing baggy clothes is interesting, especially when you
consider that as furries Sonic and Tails are usually buck nekkid anyway.
     OK, fans, close all the doors because logic is gonna fly out
the windows.  Sonic is spared, not by a boot to Geoff's head from
Sally (as in "Mecha Madness" when she decked Knuckles) but by a
left hook from...Antoine!?  Yes, everyone's favorite pain in the
butt now gets a chance to demonstrate his loyalty and to launch
into an exposition of his own.  According to this abridged version
(which itself demanded the richer detail and steadier pacing of a
solo story, something along the line of "Fathers and Sons") Antoine
was a mere cadet in training when Robotnik took over and the REAL
founder of the underground -- Antoine's father -- went to the
roboticizer, no doubt singing the Mobian equivalent of the
"Marseilles".  Antoine and Geoffrey mix it up some more, and Sally
breaks it up so Antoine can supply additional exposition.  I know
that Ken has said that he writes stories as if the comic were
attracting new readers all the time, but this much exposition is
getting ridiculous.  In "Knuckles' Quest #3", f'rinstance, we were
treated to an eight-page story with two pages of exposition: that's
a staggering 25%!  I guess it's better than repeated editorial
boxes courtesy of Justin or Freddy or whatever name he goes by.
     So anyway, Bunnie takes over the exposition (keep in mind that
NONE of this has ever so much as been hinted at in either the
comics or the SatAM series, and we just have to take Ken and Kent's
word for it, so there!) and adds the angle that Antoine is, in
addition to being a "dashing hero", a victim of unrequited love for
Sally.  Yeah, him and a whole lotta drooling fanboys!  Bunnie
promptly rectifies this situation by going up to Antoine and
declaring her own feelings for him, complete with a heart iris.  So
it looks like Bunnie and Antoine could be an item!  Who could have
predicted this turn of events?  Who could have seen it coming? 
Who...who am I kidding!?  This angle has been a staple of Robert
Brown and Francis Tolbert's fanfic from the very beginning.  Made
it easier for ME to believe it!  
     Meanwhile, back at the campfire, things are heating up within
the Wolf Pack as Lupee wonders out loud why Drago has been
absenting himself so frequently lately.  So now we've got Lupee
suspicious of Drago, Drago suspicious of Sir Charles, Geoffrey
suspicious of Sir Charles and Sonic, and Antoine suspicious of
Geoffrey.  Sally finally gives the lot of them a time-out, and the
story ends with a rather weak segue to
     "A Goat, A Raven, and a Swan Song!" (Knuckles' Quest 4)
     Story: Ken and Kent; Art: Manny Galan (who gets to put a grave
above the second "a" in his last name!  Yeah, yeah, I've been
pronouncing it "GALE-un" all along myself.)
     After some MORE exposition, and bumping into an out-of-place
humanoid skeleton (probably the remains of some poor soul who's
STILL waiting to receive SonicQuest by mail!), Knuckles goes
spelunking until he runs across two "weird dudes" -- yeah, like
everybody else he's run into to date has been normal!  After
identifying them as Mathias Poe (raven) and Damocles the Elder
(goat), Knuckles makes a rather undignified entrance.  In response,
Knuckles is attacked by something conjured up by Mathias: quoth the
raven, "a golem made of metal."  It's basically a really tough bot
and bears no resemblance at all to the legendary creature conjured
up by Rabbi Judah Lowi of Prague to protect the city's Jews from
Christian mobs incited by allegations of blood libel.  Trust me, I
know from the legend of the Golem of Prague.  Anyway, Archimedes
(who apparently had been goofing off in Knuckles' backpack the
whole time his buddy was slaving away for the Enchantress in Quest
#3) tells Knux that a golem needs "a constant supply of magic life" -- 
in the case of the Golem of Prague it was a slip of paper on
which was written the one name of God which people weren't supposed
to pronounce, and since it's basically a word composed of four
Hebrew vowels 

RDB note: I thought it was _consonants_: YHWH???

pronouncing it is quite a trick anyway!  Archimedes
uses his fire-breathing shtick to distract Mathias (quoth the
raven, "ARRKK!"), cutting the channel to the golem.  This sets up
not only the golem's destruction, but a stupidly predictable Arnold
Schwarzenegger joke.  As for Damocles, he begins to melt thanks to
a handy chemical spill.  But before a HazMat Team can arrive on the
scene, the figure of Damocles either turns into or else melts to
reveal (it isn't spelled out all that clearly) the long-sought-
after sword.  Remember the sword?  Knuckles bears it aloft,
commands it to take him to the Hall of Limbo (remember the Hall of
Limbo?) and the Crown of Acorns (remember the Crown?).  And...
     ...nothing happens.
     A lesser character might have asked Mathias where he's put the
Owner's Manual; at the very least, he'd have started looking for
the URL for the "Use and Maintenance of Your Magic Sword" page on
the World Wide Web.  Instead, Knuckles demonstrates his recently-
acquired intelligence by NOT beating the answer out of Mathias. 
Forgetting about the bird altogether, he decides that exactly how
the Royal Toad Sticker works is now Someone Else's Problem and
figures he'll let Sally worry about it.  That's the kind of
ruthless corporate logic that would impress Dogbert!
     Nelson Ortega's artwork is uneven but serviceable; I can't
remember the last time Sonic's head looked that big.  The
roboticizing of Sonic's father was the most impressive sequence
while his rendering of Geoffrey varied.  And Manny Galan has
FINALLY found his calling!  After horrible renderings of the
Knothole crew, his drawings of Knuckles and Archimedes are as close
to Art Mawhinney's excellent work in "Rites of Passage" as you can
get.  The stories, which seem to be on the brink of converging in
#47, were well-paced (aside from some jumpiness in "Countdown" what
with all the expositions).  "Countdown" even managed to overcome
the problem of Ken and Kent trying to shoehorn too much material
into too few pages (obviously for the sake of setting up the
"Endgame" arc).  It was a good issue with many laudable points.
     So why, when it was all over, was I left feeling so depressed?
     One of the charms of the Sonic series (for me at any rate) was
the fact that these kids -- remember, they're the Mobian equivalent
of teenagers -- weren't members of some macho elite fighting force. 
This was never "Red Dawn" with fur -- that feeling was never there. 
Instead, the Knothole crew was a surrogate family.  It was a
scenario which advertised itself with every use of a familiar name:
Aunt Sally, Uncle Chuck, "little bro".  It isn't just Sally that's
going to die in the next issue; according to therapists like John
Bradshaw or Claudia Black who have studied family dynamics, when
one member of a family is gone or is an addict the entire family is
thrown off.  Ken and Kent seem to understand this but appear to
want to aggravate the process.  It was no fun watching the charges
and countercharges of espionage and treason flying around because
instead of building up tensions and creating false leads in the
name of story structure, we get treated to the sight of watching
the Knothole "family" unravel like a cheap sweater.  Who needs
THAT?  Ken has stated that the "new age" of Sonic comics begins
with this issue.  Given the way I feel, it's not a prospect I
welcome.  He seems to know where he wants to go and doesn't mind
trashing the things that made the Sonic story worthwhile (to at
least some of his readers) in the first place.  If reviewing these
stories continues along this rather unsatisfying path, I may simply
let my subscription lapse when it runs out and go back to scanning
issues on the newsstand, taking notes, and writing up short plot
summaries.  This job is losing its emotional payoff.  Some new age!

RDB note: to beat Ken to the punch: at least hang in till past #50...

     Sonic-Grams: I'm not even going to bother with Freddy's hype
of #47.  And I don't know from "Knuckles: The Dark Legion" because
I haven't ordered it from Archie yet -- it sure isn't on sale
anywhere around here.  Let's see what's on TV:
Click.
     "The Archie Wrestling Federation: the revolutionary force in
     preadolescent humor as enacted by adolescent cartoon characters!

     lost the match by a controversial countout!  Now he wants that

     Forget it.  Yeah, there are letters and a Note from the Net,
but I'm too bummed to deal with them.  Sorry, people.
     Way to go, Ron.

RDB note: is that praise or blame?  :^)  (The latter for giving Ken the 
second season material to adapt, for better or worse...)     

     #47 [June 1997]
     "Taking The Fall" 
     "Brought to you with pride by: Ken Penders (script); 
Art Mawhinney (art)".  Talk about "In your face!"
     Placing the title page and the credits on the LAST page of
this installment may be only one of a number of tricks being
perpetrated on the reader.  I'm going to try ignoring all but the
most glaring ones; if I wanted to do something cerebral I'd play chess!
     Splash page: decent but again with the tricky wording by Ken
at the end, juxtaposing "fallen" with "survive" as if to imply
"falling=not surviving."  Not even the first real page and
already I get the feeling somebody's screwing with my head!
     OK, Sonic and Sally manage to scale Robotnik's HQ 
while under surveillance from the Wolf Pack.  Lupe'
(VERY well drawn by Mawhinney, as is just about everyone he's
ever drawn...OK, except Mobie!) does the verbal equivalent of
hitting Drago on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper for
suggesting that the Pack should be soloing this mission.  Drago
sends a signal to the Knothole crew which is aided by...Dr.
Quack?  He himself wonders why he was drafted: "I'm a doctor, not
a commando!"  He may not have studied medicine under Dr. McCoy
but they must have had the same acting coach.  
     Cue the Princess's flashback, this time in shades of blue
rather than sepia.  After a quick one-panel reminder of the
campout in #46 with NO elaboration at all as to the flinging of
charges and countercharges, and an editorial box by J. Freddy
which is no help at all, we jump to a scene which MAYBE will be
covered in "Battle Royal."  Or maybe not; J. Fred doesn't even
contribute a box for this sequence, and it needs one badly.  A
definitely underutilized Rosie (a rather welcome presence,
actually) summons Sally into another room where...
     OK, this is where I had some SERIOUS problems with the
story.  If it was just a matter of continuity and the lag in
releasing "Battle Royal", fine.  But the next two pages of
business between Sally and the King -- who is suddenly restored
to normal -- are wrong from beginning to end.  Sally observes
that nobody had informed her of her father's recovery; you ain't
alone, Sal!  So what happens during this major moment when I'd
expect at least a couple panels of father-daughter bonding in a
tearful reunion, much as was done in both "Blast To The Past",
Part 1 and "The Void"?  The King launches into this weird tirade
about how "we may have a traitor in our midst...Sonic the
Hedgehog!", complete with banging on tables.  Yes, he's talking
about the same Sonic whom he talked with in the Zone/Void/Whatever 
during "The Dream Zone" , the same Sonic who pulled the King's royal 
caboose out of said Zone in "And One Shall Save Him," the same Sonic 
who did the exact same thing in "The Void," the same Sonic who's been 
knocking himself out trying to collect Chaos Emeralds, power rings,
magic rings, piston rings, WHATEVER so Sally won't have a father 
who'd end up looking like the daily special at a New Age crystal shop...
you get the idea.  The alleged King's performance leaves Sally in tears 
as she runs from the room.  She, along with those readers who have been 
hanging in there all along, know better.  The whole sequence can be 
summed up by a line from Buddy Love in the original Jerry Lewis 
"Nutty Professor": "Mood is wrong, mood is WRONG!"
     Let's get back to the mission, shall we?  For some reason,
Sonic starts heading down an air vent while Sally lowers herself
down the building on a rope.  Even THIS looks too weird; you'd
think that Mobians would have figured out how to rappel.  Then
again, since these ARE furries and rappelling works better when
you're wearing pants, maybe not.  Anyway, Sal is moving down the
building in plain sight of Robotnik, who pays her the
gratuitous(?) compliment of calling her "the apple of her
father's eye", an eye which I'd increasingly like to blacken at
this point.  So Robotnik deploys several...I guess you'd call
them cannons of some sort...which then begin shooting wildly,
missing both Sally and her ropes despite the fact that they're
firing from what can only be point-blank range.  Antoine displays
his new-found executive skills by observing: "She is in grave
danger!", which is not only painfully obvious but sounds like
another red herring.  Or am I getting paranoid?
     Rotor chooses this moment to "field test" that BFG he showed off at 
the beginning of "Black and Blue and Red All Over" (Sonic #44), mindless 
of the possibility that the [shrapnel] from the exploding cannons just 
might not be the best thing for Sally's health, either.  Not to mention 
what would happen if his aim was off and Sally took a direct hit.
     OK, time for things to go very sour very fast.  The Knothole
group notices Sonic...or a reasonable facsimile...on the balcony
where Sally had secured the rope.  They then see this figure cut 
the rope and it takes all five panels on page 9 for Sally, her 
terminal velocity having been slowed by an awning, to hit the ground.  
This may have been as much to avoid offending the delicate sensibilities 
of the Sega watchdogs as to prolong Sally's agony.
     Bunnie begins to step in to evac Sally, which gives Robotnik
another opportunity to display poor marksmanship until the Wolf
Pack start laying down fire themselves.  Bunnie reaches Sally
first, so now is a good time to CUT AWAY from this development to...
     Robotnik's control room, where Sonic arrives and confronts
the big guy.  Snively refers to Sonic as "reality challenged",
which describes someone who thinks sales of Sonic Comics will
continue rising no matter what.  While Sonic is kept preoccupied
avoiding blaster fire, Robotnik and Snively make a break for it. 
Sonic, meanwhile, manages to use the old mirror trick to take the
lasers out of commission, then asks himself the question the
readers were asking themselves two pages back: What about Sally? 
As for Robotnik, he figures now is as good a time as any to do
the old Destroy-The-Headquarters bit to make sure Sonic is toast.
     Speaking of toast, Ken perpetrates an obscure, unforgivable pun
on page 14.  Bunnie is carrying Sally in her arms, saying: "We're 
SHOAH not leaving without her!"(emphasis mine).  This isn't just
another attempt as a Southern accent.  It so happens that "shoah"
is the Hebrew word for a sacrificial offering, and Jews observe
"Yom ha Shoah" in memory of those who died during the Holocaust...
     Excuse me...I'm losing it....



     I lost it.  I swear to God, between seeing the picture of
Sally stretched out in the center panel of page 14 and typing the
word "Holocaust" I lost it.  If Ken Penders didn't know the
significance of the word "shoah" it was a powerful coincidence. 
If he DID know, it was just plain sick.
     I'm sorry, I can't go on with this review.  I scanned the
issue, I know generally what's coming, you probably do as well
but I'm not going any further.  Not now.  Maybe I'll finish
summarizing #47 in conjunction with #48.  Accent on "maybe."

RDB note: I hope your office door is soundproof... :^(  A couple things 
that helped me: keep reminding yourself that "it's only a comic book", and 
get a good night's sleep...


OK.  Ken insists that the use of the word "shoah" meant nothing cosmic;
it was something he borrowed from a Stan Lee G.I. {character} who was 
supposed to be a Southerner.  I can accept that.  I just did some 
heavy-duty word association that sent me into an emotional tailspin.  
So I take a few deep breaths and make a few notes about the back half 
of #47 (skipping over plot points, features, etc).:

SHE'S DEAD, JIM: Glad that the actual moment was handled in silence.
I'm a great believer in having the characters just shut up and let the
artwork carry the narrative forward.  Could've been a tad stronger but the 
Rosie-Tails pose is perfect.  Down side: the body is never shown.  This 
adds a certain ambiguity to the storyline.  Accident?  I don't think so.

NO JUICING ALLOWED: It was, after all, a clean death.  No blood, not
even a trickle.  Again, credit Sega with not wanting to corrupt our
innocent eyeballs. (BTW, "to juice" is a professional wrestling term
meaning "to bleed profusely, usually by cutting yourself across the
forehead with a razor blade, as a way of adding excitement to the
match".  Which explains why some wrestlers have weird-looking foreheads.
Just a Fun Fact for when you read Battle Royal).

RDB note: now you've done it - now Sonic can't ever use that term again :^)

GENDER-BENDER: Hershey makes her appearance.  At least I THINK it's a
her.  At least she's turned out to be a black-and-white DSH (domestic
shorthair) and not the full-blown black cat cliche' which the Sorceror
in Knuckles' Quest #3 proved to be.  Yet Mawhinney didn't exactly go out
of his way to assert her femininity: a bracelet, sorta kinda longish
eyelashes, and having Drago call her "Babe".  She's certainly not as
_zaftig_ (Yiddish: "shapely") as Bunnie, and she lacks the extra head
fur that Sally had.  At the risk of firing the first shot in a flame war
that could take years and cost millions of lives, when I first saw the
page with Hershey I momentarily (for a few seconds) wondered whether
Hershey was a male and, if so, whether that meant Hershey and Drago were
both gay.  Get real: the Sega watchdogs would never have allowed THAT
angle.  One word of advice for Hershey: makeover.

AND IT'S ONE, TWO, THREE/WHAT'RE WE {FIGHTIN'} FOR?: And I thought the
legal proceedings in "Court Martial" (#41) were a joke!  No sooner is
Sonic back in Knothole than Geoffrey slaps the cuffs on him for the
compound charges of treason and murder.  We have the Hershey-Drago
interlude, then cut to Sonic's sentencing and banishment.  For those of
us who wondered how the King would handle the death of his only child,
I'd say he's taking it well.  Too well.  He doesn't seem to have shed
tear one.  Anyone else in that situation would have gone the summary
justice route and tried wringing Sonic's neck barehanded.  The lack of
passion on his part makes the AntiKing option look more plausible.

Beyond that, there's a pretty obvious lack of due process in Knothole.
I know there were probably page limitations Ken had to deal with, but
come on!  Sonic's getting railroaded here even worse than in "Court
Martial."  I suppose you could argue that everyone's so shell-shocked by
grief that they're pretty much letting the "King" do as he will, 

RDB note: and notice also no reaction to the King's recovery - supposedly 
only Sally and Rosie knew about it just before the mission - I find it hard 
to believe it was made public shortly thereafter...

but is this the kind of "freedom" they've been fighting for all these years?
By story's end, there's not that much to choose from between the "King"
and Robotnik.

Next month: Sonic's impersonation of Harrison Ford (or David Jansen if
you're a baby boomer).  If what Ken says is true, Sonic turns on the
waterworks and mourns his lost love, despite pressure from Sega.  I
guess if we're going to do any freedom fighting in this little corner of
the galaxy, it'll be over the First Amendment.

RDB note: another long 4 weeks...  On that note, I hope everybody has a 
Happy Easter, whether it means anything to you personally or not...

#48 [July 1997]
"Sonic the Fugitive"
Story: Ken Penders; Art: Manny Galan

     Ivo Robotnik here.  Well, the fool who usually writes these
reviews is off somewhere, probably still maundering 

RDB note: in which sense?  (pulls out dictionary): 1.  Obsolete: To 
grumble; growl.  2.  To move languidly or idly [compare meander]
3.  To speak indistinctly or disconnectedly; mutter.

over Princess Sally's demise or entering some poem or other into that
"Cybershrine" he set up in her memory.  Allow me to contribute
something of my own.  I call it "Ode to a Princess".  Ahem:

          Sally was here but now she's gone;
          Her furry friends must carry on.
          I knew the Acorn brat quite well
          And thanks to Archie she's rotting in...

     "Excuse me, Dr. Robotnik."

     SNIVELY!  You interrupted me just as I was about to climax my declamation!

RDB note: HEY!  There'll be none of that here!  :^)

     "Terribly sorry, Sir, but you might want to get on with the
review before someone detects our presence."

     I might ALSO want to grind you into powder!  Keep THAT in mind, Snively!

     "Y-yes, Sir!"

     Now let me see, where was I?  Oh, never mind, let's recap
that delightful story in #47.  Sonic escaped the destruction of
my headquarters, as I had anticipated....

     "YOU had anticipated?  It was I who suggested...."

     You were saying something, Snively?

     "Nothing at all, Sir.  (You bloated sack of...)"

     Anyway, he arrives back at Knothole to discover that not
only is the love of his life dead, but that he's charged with her
deliberate murder!  Her attempted murder would have worked just
as well for my purposes, but the Princess's demise was icing on
the cake.  I don't need to rehash everything else about the story
so let's get on with the present story, shall we?

     Let's see: we start with what is appropriately called (in
the Princess's case) a "splash page" with just enough words on it
to obscure the sight of that troublesome rodent.  From there, we
watch as he's being taken aboard a plane to what he thinks will
be a jail sentence.  He should be so lucky.  Page 2...just some
inconsequential dialogue by that pack of furry adolescents who
thought they could possibly do me any harm.

     "I wouldn't be quite so sure, Sir."

     What did you mean by that?

     "Well, Sir, rumors are beginning to circulate on the Net
that the Princess may not be dead after all."

     You've been watching too many episodes of "The X-Files",
Snively.  They speak of her death three times on pages 1 and 2
ALONE, and they actually use the WORD!  That's more than that bit
player, Julayla, got in "In The Still Of The Night" (#18).  AND
there's that art on the aforementioned splash page!  Penders can't 
have it both ways.  He's written himself into a corner from which there's 
no escape without leaving his credibility as a writer in  shreds.  
So I wouldn't pay any attention to the ambiguities.  Not yet, anyway.

     "That's not the worst of it, though.  Rumor also has it that
you and Sonic are to fight it out in #50 and..."

     And WHAT!?

     "And you're supposed to lose, Sir."

     Lose?

     "As in, get killed, Sir."

     What do you think I look like, a ground squirrel?  Use that
lightbulb-shaped head of yours, dear boy.  The Princess is gone,
but Robotnik will endure and conquer!

     "How can you be so sure, Sir?"

     Logic, for one thing.  If indeed the fix is in and that
Acorn whelp manages to come back to life, what's to stop the same
thing from happening to ME?  Her resurrection can only be justified 
because her death would violate some rule or standard of the comic book 
industry, a standard which applies just as much to ME as it does to her.  
Besides, I have something the Princess never had....

     "High cholesterol?"

     No, friends in high places.

     "In the government?"

     Yes, but also where it REALLY counts: in the boardroom of
Sega! [A two-note musical phrase sounds; Robotnik and Snively
genuflect toward Japan].  Remember, I've been through this before.

     "Yes, I remember!  When you were ... uh ... 'inconvenienced' in 
'The Three Phases of E.V.E.' (#22), the people at Sega were MOST upset!"

     I believe Mr. Penders said that they "just about had a cow"
until he agreed to bring me back to life in "The Return" in the
very next issue.  THERE was a two-issue story arc that most
people seem to have forgotten!  But not me, Snively.  I have
logic and precedent on my side; all the Princess has on HER side
are broken ribs and internal organs that have been turned to
jelly by the force of impact!  No, Snively, my position is secure
for life...which is more than that Acorn adolescent can say!

     ("Your self-confidence will be your downfall, you rotund...")

     I HEARD THAT!!  Still, I'd better check the contents of my
Survival Kit just to be on the safe side.  Let me see: a copy of
my Archie contract; a copy of my Sega contract; a copy of my DiC
contract...hmm, better hang onto that just to be on the safe
side...my paid-up AFTRA membership, my...SNIVELY!  Where's Johnny
Cochran's phone number?

     "Programmed into your speed dial, Sir."

     Excellent.  And my portfolio of photographs of the executives at...

     "Oh dear, one of them feel out.  Permit me to...GOOD
HEAVENS!  WHAT'S HE DOING WITH THAT GOAT!?"

     GIVE ME THAT!!!  Do you know what this represents?

     "Job security?"

     And don't you forget it!  Now, where were we?

     "Page 3, Sir."

     Ah, yes.  The REAL fun begins on page 4 when my SWATbots
bring down the plane.

     "Without killing the passengers, sir."

     Yes, unfortunately.  It's SO hard to build good help these days.  
But what did you think of page 5?

     "Sir?"

     It went right by you, didn't it?

     "I don't follow, Sir."

     Of course not.  That's the genius of it: the subtlety with
which I destroy the hedgehog inch by inch, thanks to that cat's
paw Penders.  Look at the words he used: "Not one single joke or
wisecrack escapes his lips...for the first time in his life Sonic
is devoid of humor..."  You know what Sonic is without humor?

     "No, Sir."

     He's no longer Sonic!  I'm depersonalizing him step by step,
gradually destroying his personality.  And when I'm finished with
him and he has no personality to speak of, nothing even vaguely
resembling an emotional life, it's only a small step to simply
roboticizing the body because the soul will be gone.

     "Extremely diabolical, Sir."

     I thought so.  Let's just jump to the bottom of page 9. 
Another masterstroke, thanks to my connections at Sega and the
pressure they put on Archie Comics.  Any of those fanfic
scribblers on the Net would have had Sonic "feel[ing] the true
impact of Sally's passing" by showing the hedgehog weeping and
mourning and carrying on.  Right?

     "It would be the thing to do, I would think."

     So what does the hedgehog do?  He passes out and goes to
sleep.  Her death doesn't even trouble his dreams on page 13;
he's dreaming about his dog!  It's all yet another step in my
plan: leave the little rugrats who buy this rag with the unspoken 
impression that Sonic in his heart of hearts never really cared
for the Princess at all!

     "Excellent strategy, Sir."

     Let's see...Oh, let's just skip to page 17 and get to the
good part.  After some gratuitous demeaning of the so-called
"freedom fighters", 

RDB note: "gratuitous" indeed, after St. John _and_ Drago...

the King introduces his perfect candidate for
the reinstated position of Warlord...

     "Do I have to guess?"

     Any more backtalk from you, Snively, and you'll get...the
"Heaven's Gate" treatment.

     "You mean that suicidal computer cult?"

     No, Snively, something much worse.  Look at the label on 
this videocassette.

     "No!  Not that!  Not the motion picture 'Heaven's Gate'
written and directed by Michael Cimino!"

     And this is a bootleg copy of the director's cut!  Five
hours and twenty-five minutes of what even the film's producer
called "intolerable, unbearable, unwatchable, staggering self-
indulgence"!  And after I've made you sit through it, you'll have
to watch it again.  And again!  AND AGAIN!!

     "Stop!!  Stop!! That's too horrible, even for YOU!  Spare
me, Sir!  I promise I won't be disloyal to you again!!"
     
     That's better.  Now, let's just bask at the magnificence of
my entrance.  I'm able to easily dispatch that low-tech pea
shooter they tried to use against me.  Exactly how will
probably be better explained in "Battle Royal", which is why I
insisted that its distribution be held up--no sense giving the
game away too soon.  Unfortunately, they cut away from me just
when I start showing those little throw rugs who's the REAL power
of this Brave New World they've been talking about.  I could
contemplate that sequence for hours.

     "We may not have that much time, Sir."

     I thought I told you to get me unlimited usage on AOL! 
Well, let's just take one last look at my handiwork on page 20.

     "You're not on page 20."

     No, but my influence operating through my minions at Sega
is!  Once again I was able to undercut Mr. Penders' best efforts,
and the hedgehog is prevented from demonstrating any
recognizable, credible emotion connected with Princess Sally's
death.  In fact, if you'll look closely, the one with the tear in
his eye is that paramilitary polecat, St. John!  Honestly,
though, he's SUCH an amateur in the art of verbal sparring!  If
I'D have been there, I could have reduced the hedgehog to psychic
mush in three seconds.

     "How?"

     Well, I'd have replied to the hedgehog's declaration of love
(which Penders had to fight tooth and nail to even get into the
script) by asking him: "And did you have the chance to tell her
while she was still alive?"

     "Devastating comeback, Sir!"

     Remember, Snively: your enemy is dangerous when he loses
control, but let him lose HOPE and he's like clay in your hands!

     "Sir, we really have to post this and get going!"

     Let me see: one last bald-faced bow to some motion picture,
advertisements, letters, hype...nothing worth mentioning, really. 
Very well, post this and let's be off; I don't want to be late.

     "Late for what?"

     The story conference at Archie Comics.  Now that Mobius is
practically within my grasp, what's to keep me from extending my
influence?  Those worthless teenagers in Riverdale could also use 
some attitude adjustment.  Besides, Betty and Veronica are more to 
my tastes than Sally ever was.  Today Mobius---tomorrow, Mamaroneck!

     "Mamaroneck?"


Sonic v. Knuckles: Battle Royal #1
     no date
     "Battle Royal"
     Let's get right to the point: this is a piece of crap.  And
not just because of the mutant artwork.  Everybody except for the
Chaotix and Sonic himself is horribly off-model: Dulcy looks like
she's auditioning to be a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade, and Tails has one of those too-large baby heads.  The
artist is in love with weird points of view--page 4 panel 2 and the
double-page spread on pages 9 and 10 are prime examples both of
weird staging and even weirder composition.  And the figures look
more cartooney than they did in the cartoons; they're little more
than colored-in outlines.  Then again, so is the background.  Look
at pages 13 and 14 -- there's barely any detailing in the trees and
the grass, as if the artist didn't have time to bother giving the
scenery (or the characters themselves) any kind of weight, any
sense of reality.  Either that or he just didn't care to work up a
sweat.  This drek makes Manak look like Michelangelo!
     As for the story, that can be summed up in two words: "What
story?"  This was intended to be a continuation of both "Knuckles'
Quest" and "Prelude to Apocalypse" in #46, and a lead-in into
"Taking The Fall" in #47.  But aside from Mammoth Mogul's
insinuating himself into the Endgame plot sideways with no hint of
his involvement in the story arc up to this point, "Battle Royal"
contributes NOTHING to the story arc.  Reading the story was in
fact a waste of time: all you really had to do was read the splash
page (which pretty well telegraphs the climax of the story) and the
Epilogue on the last page.  The 24 pages inbetween were a waste of
paper, a return to the dreary Itchy-and-Scratchy fight plots I'd
thought Archie had outgrown.  The ONLY character given any kind of
attention is Mammoth Mogul, and even then all you need to know
about him at this point is that as far as he's concerned he's God. 
Don't worry about seeing the King suddenly made whole on the last
page and thinking you may have missed something: that went
unexplained in this story just as it did in "Taking The Fall."  It
would have been nice to have been offered SOMETHING besides yet one
more angle to the Endgame arc that serves to confuse rather than
enlighten.  It would have been nice to offer the reader some ray of
hope.  But hey, welcome to the Brave New World!  My [a**]!
     Frankly it's getting to the point where I don't CARE how
Endgame plays out.  With each new issue, with each new Endgame
installment, Sonic the comic is becoming less and less
recognizable.  The characters and situations that drew me to become
a Sonic fan in the first place are being cast aside.  One of the
messages I was asked to post in the Princess Sally Memorial
Cybershrine said something to the effect that the Knothole Freedom
Fighters didn't just lose a member of the team when Sally died--
they lost the heart of it.  And I feel like that's what Archie is
doing: cutting the heart and soul out of the world I'd become a fan of.  
If their replacements were in any way interesting and compelling maybe 
I wouldn't mind.  But "Battle Royal" left an extremely sour taste in my 
mouth.  It was bad art in the service of pointless writing which did 
nothing but waste my time and money.  I've never cancelled a magazine
subscription in my life but the way I feel right now I WILL cancel my
Sonic subscription if the conclusion of Endgame is even half this 
infuriating, and then someone else can post reviews or summaries of 
the comics to the FAQ File because I will have lost the desire to have 
anything to do with the comics.  

RDB note: that would take half the fun out of my list too :^(  (not to give 
you a guilt trip into sticking with something you don't like anymore though)

The story was written by Kent Taylor and Ken Penders, Sam Maxwell did the 
pencil work, Jim Amash was the inker, Karl Bollers was the colorist, Jeff 
Powell did the lettering, and the management team consisted of J. Freddy 
Gabrie as editor, Victor Gorelick as managing editor, and Richard Goldwater 
as editor-in-chief, and each and every one of them should be ashamed of
themselves!
     You want to find out about the other story in the issue, read
it yourself; I'm too disgusted to even look at my copy.

RDB note: darn; now we won't hear your comments on how Antoine's treatment 
of Bunnie will affect their budding romance (inside pun intentional :^))

#49 [Aug 1997]
     OK, last things first.  The Sonic-Grams is usually one of the
most worthless sections of the comic, made even more so recently by
the decision to have some of the other "cast members" answer the
letters.  The questions tend to be lame and/or the same questions
over and over.  And the backgrounds they've been using lately don't
help matters -- the one in this issue reminds me of a Web page with
really bad wallpaper.  But tucked away in the reply to the very
first letter, hiding behind an attempt at "Bunnie's" faux Southern
accent, are some lines that caused me to sit up and take notice:

     Our editorial staff try to keep a loose -- what's that word
     again -- continuity goin' in the books since the King's
     return.  Why?  'Cause every issue brings its own little
     surprises and affects everybody in Mobius month after month.

Never mind the breakdown of the accent, never mind the false
modesty that comes off like cluelessness, never mind the fact that
having a character talk about the "editorial staff" demolishes the
fourth wall between the world of the story and the reader.  This
was an important statement on Archie's part.  Tom Wolfe put it best
when he wrote in _The Painted Word_:

     I knew what I was looking at.  I realized that without making
     the slightest effort I had come upon one of those utterances
     in search of which psychoanalysts and State Department
     monitors of the Moscow or Belgrade press are willing to endure
     a lifetime of tedium: namely, the seemingly innocuous *obiter
     dicta*, the words in passing, that give the game away.

We all know how complex the stories have been getting even before
"Endgame" began.  Later on I plan to detail just how many loose
ends have to be tied up in "Endgame" alone!  But it appears that
the phrase "loose continuity" as defined by Archie Comics'
editorial staff (meaning that some new angle is introduced in every
issue) is the staff's way of saying: "We know we can't tie up all
the loose ends of 'Endgame' in #50.  As a matter of fact, we won't
even TRY!"  The editorial staff will simply make the stories as
complex as they need to be, and probably more so, while placing
themselves under NO OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER TO THE READER TO RESOLVE
MATTERS BY THE END OF THE STORY AND/OR ARC.  I can't function that
way as a fanfic writer, as I write each story to stand on its own. 
But having established Archie's policy with regard to story
structure it's time we took a look at that policy in practice:

     Endgame: Part 3: "Escape From The Floating Island" [Yeah, I
know, Sonic doesn't even GET to the Floating Island until near the
end of the story, and even then it's all he can do to figure out
how to keep his hedgehog head on his shoulders.  Looks like the device 
of tacking the story title onto the last frame sorta broke down in this 
case.  But hey, nobody ever said loose continuity was easy.]  
     Story: Mike Gallagher and Ken Penders
     Art: Sam Maxwell
     Just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so the
Spaz/Harvo cover suffers from a single flaw that compromises the
whole composition.  The flaw, in this case, is Dulcy.  I know her
gestures and expression are meant to convey extreme effort in
trying to spirit Sonic away from his pursuers.  Unfortunately, the
end result makes it look more like she's suffering from some
uncomfortable physical ailment.  Between the attitude of her arms
and her facial expression she appears to be fighting a losing
battle against constipation.  In which case she could probably USE
some "loose continuity."  I'm sorry, but it's hard to take this
cover seriously so long as Dulcy looks like she's trying to take a
dump.  It brings the whole cover down and puts it in the running
for Worst Cover Art of 1997.
     From there we proceed to the Semi-Obligatory Splash Page. 
This is Sam Maxwell's second splash page so far.  In the one for
"Battle Royal" he showed the Mobians as pawns in Mammoth Mogul's
chess game; here, Sonic and Sally are marionettes being manipulated
by Robotnik.  You might want to talk with a psychiatrist about
those control issues, Sam.  And speaking of psychiatric help, Ivo
could use a dose himself.  C'mon, a grown man playing with dolls! 

RDB note: you obviously haven't read alt.sex.plushies... :^|

Unless that's not Sonic's TAIL dangling down between his legs, in which 
case maybe Robotnik should just forget about therapy and get a girlfriend.
     Can't put it off any longer, let's get to the story.  Rather than 
stand around and take a crossbow bolt to the head (making good on the 
threat Geoffrey's been making since "And One Shall Save Him", #41), 
Sonic leaps off the cliff.  Sonic realizes that he's "mentally and 
physically exhausted" by the story so far (as Bunnie might say: 
"Y'all ain't the ONLY one, sugar-hog!") and a lesser hero in his 
situation might submit to the inevitable and make the wry observation 
that at least he's going to meet the same fate as his late beloved Sally.
But Sonic has one last chance, and it is a masterpiece of bad writing and
worse science.  Try THIS out on your science teacher, kids: he pulls off 
one of his sneakers, somehow collects a handful of dirt from the inside, 
manages to throw said handful of dirt which suddenly increases in volume 
to form a kind of arc which is strong enough to support his weight as
he runs across it to (relative) safety.  Well, at least we now know
why Ken Penders teamed up with Mike Gallagher for this installment:
Ken wanted to rely on the scientific expertise of the same writer
who tried convincing us in "Sonic Blast" that if you work fast
enough you can pack water into "waterballs", in violation of I
don't know how many laws of molecular science.  Sorry, Mike, but
don't plan on picking up your Nobel Prize for Physics any time soon.
     While Sonic catches his breath, Geoffrey (whose physique is
starting to look something like Captain America's) knows there's no
way he could plausibly duplicate that dirt trick so he and his
forces start backtracking down to the ground.  Sonic picks himself
up and starts making his way back to Knothole.  Back at Knothole,
Robotnik gives the King one last order: "Say 'Good night,' Gracie!" 
He then presses a very prominent button (which we haven't been
allowed to see before and which apparently missed the notice of
EVERYONE ELSE in Knothole!) on the back of the King's head, and he
promptly goes to pieces.  Yep, the King was a bot.  Who'da thunk
it?  Not me; I thought the "King" was a recruit from the world of
the Antisonic myself.  Such a plot twist would have avoided the
obvious, which everyone else on the list seems to have spotted. 
Well, it was a nice theory while it lasted.  Robotnik then tells
the assembled Mobians that he's letting them live until some unspecified 
"weapon of destruction" is finished.  At which point, THEY'LL be finished.
     Meanwhile Dr. Quack is submitting the results of his work
to...Snively.  He gives him Sally's Death Certificate, which lists
her name as "ACORN, Sally Elisha."  Which was a surprise to me
because Sally didn't LOOK Jewish!  C'mon!  "Elisha" is a guy's name,
specifically the name of an Old Testament prophet!  At first that
seemed like a clue as to Sally's fate, since in II Kings 4 Elisha
is credited with resurrecting the son of a Shunamite woman.  But I
figured that was a little TOO obscure of a Biblical reference. 
Anyway, after giving Snively the impression that he's delivered his
*quid*, the doc wants to see some *quo*.  In response, Snively
presses a button...on the back of his hand!  At NO point in the
Sonic story has it even been HINTED that Snively was a bot, but
that's loose continuity for ya.  Dr. Quack does this really weird
take; frankly he looks like a duck getting goosed.  At once a wall
slides out of the way to reveal...one of the hoariest old gimmicks
around: the good doctor's family being held hostage.  Quack runs to
them, viewed from the back at a really weird angle.  In "The Dream
Zone" (#43) Quack mentioned that he'd studied under Dr.
Frankenstein; from the look of the panel on the top of page 9 my
guess is he was also a body double for Igor the Hunchbacked
Assistant.  The doc threatens Snively and is promptly shot by a
nearby Combot; however, since Dr. Quack is up and babbling in the
next panel it's safe to assume that the Combot's phaser was set on
STUN.  The doc is then assigned a new patient: the real King Acorn,
who is still in the process of turning into a piece of costume
jewelry.  So either the doc continues to play nice with Snively or
else his wife and hatchlings will end up covered in brown sauce and
hanging in the window of a Chinese deli.
     "And back to Sonic", it says.  About time, too.  He is nearing
Knothole but is fatigued.  He wonders out loud, as many of us have
wondered in private, "How much longer is this going to drag on?" 
Now THERE'S a cue!  I'll spare you Gallagher's description of
Sonic's whistling: it's just as scientifically unsound (no pun
intended) as the dirt bit but not nearly as stupid.  Anyway, Dulcy
makes her appearance in the story, looking much more on-model and
much less bloated than she did in "Battle Royal".  She gives Sonic
what nobody else in Knothole seems to be able to give him: the
benefit of the doubt.  She then whisks him off just in time for
Sonic to avoid capture by Geoffrey yet again!
     Quick cut to Hershey's place.  Gallagher's scientific bulldada
has had such a pervasive effect on Knothole that Hershey's mirror 
begins to defy the laws of optics.  Look at the second panel on
page 13; between the angle of her head and the placement of her
arms, there's NO WAY that her reflection corresponds to her body
placement.  Drago, however, suffers from no such problem.  Must be
a sexist mirror.  It's certainly a sexist sequence because we get
treated to Drago abusing Hershey, physically, verbally, and (if all
that garbage about her wearing a patently phony-looking Sonic suit
to send Sally to her death in #47 is too much of a strain for you
to believe) psychologically.  Do they REALLY need to show Hershey
being slapped around in order to keep this story moving?
     Break for the Fan Art page.  Like Sam Maxwell, Michelle
Niese's drawing of Dulcy is the only one that's anywhere near on-
model.  And the "Find Your Name in Print" page -- nice drawing of
Sonic but it makes a lousy watermark.  Same advice as before, guys:
LOSE THE WALLPAPER!
     As if following the story up until now was bad enough, it's
time to cut to Downunda.  Specifically to the site which was once
the location of Echidnopolis before it became the Floating Island,
and the scene of Tails' encounter with Athair in the Tails
miniseries, "Southern Crossover."  We are told it now "reeks of
suffering, despair, and palpable malevolence."  But the Archie
staff will have to hold their story conference somewhere else
because the spot is needed for the scene where Bunnie and Antoine
are thrown in jail.  Bunnie has been fitted with a collar wired to
her robotic limbs.  As it's explained for our benefit: "Any attempt
to use your bionic appendages will trigger your collar alarm which
in turn will activate the explosive device on [Antoine's] collar." 
Hmmm, "any attempt to use your bionic appendages" -- you mean like
for walking?  Unless that collar can sense HOW she uses her limbs
she should have taken the top of Antoine's head off by now.  Not
that it couldn't use a trim; it appears that Bunnie and Antoine
have acquired a case of Baby Head Syndrome, the malady which
afflicted Tails in "Battle Royal" and made him look horribly off-
model.  Actually, Sam compensated in Bunnie's case and made the
eyes somewhat larger; she looks cute but still infantile.  They're
not alone, though, for two of the Downunda Freedom Fighters share
their cell with them: Walt Wallaby and Barby Koala.  The cross that
THEY have to bear is that Sam has followed (after a fashion) the
modeling for the characters provided by Dave Manak for the
miniseries.  Walt now looks more like a dog (or some kind of canid)
than a wallaby; Barby still looks more like a tricked-up lab rat
than an actual koala.  Too bad she can't settle on one look: on
page 17 she's shown looking "normal"; two panels later, a close-up
reveals scratches and bruises that we didn't notices before, and
these signs of having been roughed up simply disappear in the
following panel.  Uh, Sam, there's a SLIGHT difference between
"loose continuity" and BAD continuity, and this is BAD continuity!!! 
     Enter the local villain, CrocBot.  Seems when he went over the
cliff into the crater in the miniseries he was riding in a tank; he
now part-tank.  I'll spare you his exposition of rebuilding his
army and capturing the DFF.  Next on his to-do list: mercilessly
torture Antoine and Bunnie, send their "ragged remains" to Tails to
motivate him to come to Downunda, and exact revenge for the
miniseries.  Then he needs to check his oil and rotate his tires.
     Sonic and Dulcy approach the Floating Island.  Knuckles gives
them his traditional greeting: he punches Dulcy's lights out.  Wait
a minute: Hershey got slapped around by Drago, Barby (in close-up)
looked like she was beaten up, and now Knuckles punches out Dulcy
(who's a lady dragon but still a lady).  I know Archie is trying to
pander to the preadolescent boys' market but this is really
starting to show questionable taste!  But just to show he's an
equal opportunity bruiser with a short memory (I mean, what
happened to all that camaraderie after Sally knighted him at the
end of "Battle Royal"?), he starts wailing on Sonic and they mix it
up for one page until, on the last page, Geoffrey crashes the party
in an effort to FINALLY draw some blood!  Preferably Sonic's.
     Sonic pin-up by Nelson Rebury and Harvo.  And the
aforementioned Sonic-Grams (or Bunnie-Grams in this case).  Freddy 
begins his spiel thus: "NEXT ISSUE IS THE BIG FIVE-O!!! Which is
why it's fitting that it should be called "The Big Goodbye"." 
Actually, it's NOT fitting, unless you hadn't planned to run any
issues after #50, but never mind.  "This one is everything you
expect a fiftieth issue to be."  Except that it's SHORTER than I
(or even Ken Penders) had expected it to be!  But in a concession
to the reality of having Ken's page allotment cut from 40 to 24,
Fred has backpedaled on Paul Castiglia's hype and declared that the
issue will feature "ALMOST every single writer and artist who ever
worked on Sonic" (emphasis mine).  It will be interesting to see
who got left on the cutting-room floor.  It would be even MORE
interesting if we could see how Ken had WANTED to end the story
arc.  Maybe when Ken finally gets his own Web page he can post the
original 40-page installment he'd planned; call it "Endgame: The
Director's Cut".  Has a nice ring to it.  
     So, where do we stand?  We're in the home stretch of the story
arc and aside from the questions we had quite apart from "Endgame"
(f'rinstance, WAS that Sonic's dad being roboticized in the beginning 
of #46?), the following questions may (or may not) be answered:

Is Sally alive or dead?

Will Robotnik finish his new weapon and destroy any of the Freedom Fighters?

Why is Knuckles pounding on Sonic in light of the ending of "Battle Royal"?

Will the King EVER get returned to normal?

When will the Knothole crowd discover that the Sword they have in
their possession is really just a glorified letter opener because
Mammoth Mogul has the genuine article?

Will Geoffrey finally nail Sonic in the head?

How did Drago manage that bit with Hershey and the Sonic suit?

Will Snively be having Dr. Quack's family over for dinner? 
"I ate her with faba beans and a nice Chianti."

Is the change of Sally's middle name a clue, a typo, or just a
screw-up?  And if she IS Jewish, perhaps it's just as well that
(through my sig) I've been symbolically saying Kaddish for her ever
since #47 shipped.

What will Crocbot do to Bunnie and Antoine?

Will Hershey appear on Sally Jesse Raphael's next show: 
"Cartoon Women Who Continue To Stay With The Toons Who Beat Them"?

And how many of these questions will simply be shined off in the
name of "loose continuity"?

It's too early to speak of the "Endgame" arc as a whole, but I have
to wonder about this "roller coaster ride" that Paul Castiglia spoke
of.  When I was riding the roller coasters at the late, lamented
Riverview amusement park in the Chicago of my youth, they tended to
go up and down and you sometimes had a chance to catch your breath
before the next plunge.  So far, "Endgame" has been a straight shot 
down to the ground with some lurching from side to side, with a
promise that on the LAST TWO PAGES we'll pull out of the dive. 
Maybe.  For right now, though, it feels more like dental surgery:
four months of pain that ends NOT with you feeling better, but with
you simply not feeling the pain you had going in.  Hey, it was Ken
who called Sally's death "a kick in the teeth" for the fans, not me! 
And no, I'm NOT going to let you forget that metaphor if I can help
it!  And for the record I'm STILL convinced that, between the heavy
editing of the story Ken has had to do, the "All-Star Jam" gimmick
of relying on so many artists, and the editorial doctrine of "loose
continuity", #50 has the potential of being a narrative and
artistic train wreck of Biblical proportions!

But enough of the bitterness: let's anticipate #50 as it might have
been rendered in the mindless Marvel manner:

     Three vile villains have combined their powers to defeat Sonic:

     PARSIMONIUS: Able to distort time and space by cutting a
     writer's page allotment!

     GIMMICK KING: He blows the minds of his victims by changing
     artists every three pages or so!

     THE HYPEMEISTER: He exhausts his opponents by keeping their
     expectations so high for so long they're reduced to helplessness!

     These three have combined their powers to form one mighty
     villainess.  Someone who makes Rita Repulsa look like Mother
     Theresa!  Someone who can destroy the Sonicverse as we know
     it!  Join us for issue #50 when it's the titanic struggle of:

                  SONIC versus AUNTIE CLIMAX!!!

Knuckles #1-3 [Apr-Jun 1997]
     "The Dark Legion"
     Story: Ken Penders and Kent Taylor; Art; Manny Gala'n and Andrew Pepoy
     Cover: Spaziante and Penders collaborate (for the first time,
I believe) in a three-way cover for the miniseries.  Impressive,
even though it looks like the whole triptych takes place under water.
     Part 1: Army of Darkness
     "The lessons of history and culture have always been handed
down from one generation to the next," we are told in the text that
pretty much obliterates the panels on the splash page.  You don't
have to raise your hands, but how many of you read it all the way
through before getting on with the action?  Well, there's a lot of
ground to cover so in the words of a certain hedgehog who'll play
no role whatever in this story, "Let's do it to it":
     Even before we get to the title, we (sort of) see Knuckles'
dad from the previous miniseries and other stories going back to
"Fathers and Sons" looking at a bank of monitors, one of which
shows (oddly enough) a cattle skull.  I suppose showing a saguaro
cactus would have said "desert" just as much, but never mind.  He
seems to be talking to himself, yet he also calls himself
"brother".  Before he can get around to diagnosing himself as
having multiple personalities, some kind of space-time portal in
the sky opens and the title army enters.  The AoD consists of
hooded figures riding in open flying saucers, a lot of robots which
look like they fought against Superman in the 1930s, and the
occasional tank.  We then
     Quick cut (QC for short -- better get used to that
abbreviation) to Knuckles and Archimedes kicking back.  Archie
suddenly senses Knuckles' dad trying to contact him telepathically. 
While the ant dithers about whether to tell Knuckles -- in a
situation sort of like having Caller I.D. and letting the phone
ring while you make up your mind whether to answer it -- Knuckles
picks up on something...
     QC to "The Past" where everything was mostly orange and
yellow.  We join Edmund and Dimitri explaining the mechanics of the
Chaos syphon to the assembled echidnas.  For the first time, we see
not only an ant delegation at that meeting but also a visitor's
gallery where the families are seated.  Since they lack "Hi! My
name is..." tags, we can only guess that the wives and children of
Edmund and Dimitri (one each) are in attendance; none of them are 
named.  About all we can really tell about the players at this
point is that Dimitri's son is starting to grow a Mohawk; either
that or he was Mr. T in another incarnation.
     QC to the present as Knuckles goes looking for trouble while
Archie continues talking to himself.  Knuckles finds what he was
looking for.  One of the robots picks up "heat signatures ten
kilometers to the right."    If the bot was talking about Knuckles
and Archie, it should get a tune up -- the pair are maybe ten FEET
from the bot, not ten kilometers.  Besides, ants are cold-blooded
and shouldn't even HAVE a heat signature; of course, we ARE talking
about a fire-breathing ant, so let that pass.
     QC to the destruction of Mount Fate.  Turns out the name of
Dimitri's son is "Menniker"; I tried looking it up but couldn't
find anything.  Ken manages to work in the ant quotation from
Proverbs one more time before we
     QC to the present.  The bot almost finds Archie and Knuckles
but they do that disappearing thing.  Having gone through about 5
quick changes in 8 pages, Archie gives us a break and eases us into
the next flashback, showing the Echidna Hall of Science (which
bears a certain resemblance to Bruno Taut's "Glass Pavilion", part
of the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne, Germany -- who says
comic books aren't educational?).

RDB note: actually, _you're_ doing the educating - most of us wouldn't have 
known that if you didn't point it out :^)

     We then witness a wrenching little domestic drama: apparently
the decision to dial back echidna technology was not unanimous.  So
we are treated to the sight of a VCR and a Sega Saturn unit being
confiscated from one household where the husband, a Mr. Arrunda,
shouts his objections while the Mrs. complies with the order
because she's had it up to her eyelashes with "foozball", which I
always thought was a game played by a couple drunken college guys
in a sports bar.  Or is that "foosball"?  Anyway, Edmund's son and
Menniker's cousin, Steppenwolf (named after the title character in
the Herman Hesse novel -- and THAT I was able to verify from Ken
Penders himself, BTW) is part of the clean-up crew.  Unfortunately,
in a scene that had to be guesswork instead of a true flashback,
Menniker appears to have been hoarding technology.
     Fan Art: You wonder why Archie published a lame story like
"Battle Royal"?  Sandy Lamison's fan art explains a lot about the
core constituency.  "I want my Knuckles' comic now!!!" Name Page:
"Cool out"?
     QC to the present.  Archie materializes on the bot's shoulder
and Knuckles comes down swinging.  He's only able to take out a
couple bots before having to retreat in a burst of repartee between
himself and Archie, while a hooded figure with a gleam in its
eye(?) orders the other Legionnaires to give chase.
     QC back to the high-tech roundup.  Steppenwolf tells his dad
that there's some underground discontent with the decision.  He
speaks of the opposition, "the kind that skulk in the shadows" and
wear these hooded robes that make their members stick out like sore
thumbs.  Steppenwolf follows one of these inconspicuous
insurrectionists to a meeting of Dimitri's disciples.  Naturally,
since he ISN'T dressed like a Jawa stand-in, Steppenwolf is spotted
by the anti-Luddites and they give pursuit.
     QC to Knuckles rounding up the Chaotix.  They start with
Vector, who appears to be Hooked On Ebonics.  Mighty, Charmy and
Espio join them and they set up a 4-page slugfest that ends in a
strategic withdrawal as well as a
     QC to Steppenwolf escaping via flying saucer but not very far
before his craft is shot down.  Two of the crew land to make sure
Steppenwolf has bought the farm.  All they had to do was have him
change his name to "Sally Elisha."
     QC to Knuckles recognizing lousy odds when he sees them.  The
[Chaotix] are then introduced to the head honcho: KRAGOK OF BORG. 
Well, he IS rather retrofitted.  He also shares a characteristic
with Enerjak in that their names seem to have been inspired by
losing hands of Scrabble.
     "Postcards From The Edge Of The Floating Island": No wonder
they're shopping around for a new name!  And some leftover
uncredited fan art.  Caught your breath yet?
     Part 2: Sins of the Fathers.  After a rude awakening Knuckles
is taken to Kragok for questioning.  As they begin we
     QC to "The Past" again (hope you hadn't planned on staying in
one place).  Specifically, to a council of ants.  Apparently the
echidnas hadn't had anyone in Edmund's position before.  An ant
named Christopheles is more or less volunteered to "guide" Edmund,
who on the next page is practicing his Bruce Wayne lines to
audition for the next "Batman" movie.  Christopheles starts to
explain things to Edmund but when he lets slip the news that
Steppenwolf is in danger, Edmund mounts a Pasha (some horse or
other that reminds me of that figurine from "The Black Stallion")
and rides off to the rescue.  Hey, they really DO have a thing
against technology!  BTW, Ken has stated that he hoped that
depicting the Pasha would spark some discussion about Mobian life
forms amongst the fans.  Ken, I wouldn't expect a lot of talk from
the readers about horses until their minds have been put at ease
about the fate of a certain ground squirrel.  We've got our
priorities, y'know?
     QC to Knuckles trying to punch out Kragok.  Guess he was
working up for "Battle Royal" and Sonic #49.  Anyway, he gets
beaten up for his efforts.  Kragok then asks Knuckles where the
Chaos Chamber is located.  Knuckles refuses to answer...so Kragok
orders his people to beat up on Knuckles some more.  Knuckles
manages to overcome three guards, knocking one into a tanning bed
(BOY, these guys love their technology!).  He then gets into a robe
in order to
     QC to Edmund as he comes upon the two DLers sifting through
the wreckage of Steppenwolf's saucer; no sign of Steppenwolf or the
Pasha, BTW.  He then manages to get the drop on the two of them
before a shot rings out and Edmund's glasses drop and shatter. 
Slightly more poetic [than] watching Sally become roadkill.
     Fan Art: In terms of design alone, Jeff Carnell has a nice sense.  
"I Want...."  OK, OK, they HEARD you already!
     Steppenwolf then appears out of nowhere, thanks to the magic
of Bad Writing; we have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER of how he survived the
saucer crash or where he was while his old man was getting wasted. 
As Steppenwolf mourns his father's demise, Christopheles appears
and offers his help.  Before Steppenwolf asks whether he can
resurrect the dead, we
     QC to the Chaotix, who are being sprung by the disguised
Knuckles.  In the midst of the break, Archie reappears by Knuckles'
dad just in time for yet another alarm to go off.  No, THIS time
we're not talking about any DLers but an old holdover: Athair,
still walking around in shower clogs.  You can tell from the
icicles hanging from Knuckles' dad's dialogue balloon that this
isn't going to be a Kodak moment.  But since we're on a roll
     QC to the DL base camp where the Chaotix roll a tank down a
hill and into the camp as a diversion to cover their escape while they
     QC BACK to Athair and Knuckle's dad, who is called "Grandson"
by Athair; that makes the superannuated echidna Knuckles' great-
granddad.  Just as we're on the verge of watching Knuckles' dad
reopen some old family wound...
     GOTCHA!  Bet you thought it'd be another QC!  No, but we ARE
treated to a cameo by the Ancient Walkers.  They provide some
backlighting for Athair, and then the four of them promptly
disappear.  Athair says "Consider this your warning" -- now THERE's
a statement that covers a lot of ground without telling US
anything!  Knuckles' dad then convinces Archie to stay with him
rather than rejoin the Chaotix.  As a result we
     QC to Steppenwolf's physical, mental and spiritual (!)
development under Christopheles, after which he's introduced to the
Chaos Emerald.  His ability to mentally tap into its energy and
levitate was apparently some kind of final exam.  Steppenwolf is
then set out in the middle of nowhere and just happens to pass
through some invisible/dimensional gateway into the headquarters
seen in Part 1.  Well, we FINALLY know how Knuckles' dad managed
that wall of flames vanishing act in "Fathers and Sons".  From the
base of operations, called "Haven," 
     QC to hell as the Chaotix, still on the lam from the DL, find
themselves cut off by a forest fire started by the Legion's tanks. 
Now you or I might think being trapped in a forest fire would be
enough peril and a suitable cliffhanger for one issue; but we're
not executives, are we?  I have a sinking feeling that some higher-
up at Archie took one look at the ending of the issue and said:
"Hey!  Make it a forest fire AND a stampede!"  So we're treated to
the Chaotix about to be trampled by a bunch of inhabitants of the
Floating Island we've never seen before (for the most part) and
whose only purpose for existing (at this point) is to provide a
convenient plot device!  And Ken wonders why the Pasha didn't
elicit more comments.
     Part 3: "Blood is Thicker" but you can't show it in the comic.
     "What does one do when faced with an enemy whose resources
seem limitless, whose numbers are many, and whose goal is total
victory no matter "what" the cost?"  If you're an editor, you
wonder why there are quotation marks around the word WHAT.  If
you're an echidna named Knuckles, you let Freddy worry about that
sort of thing while you try to figure how to get your caboose out
of the way of the stampede.  So you have Mighty push a tree down in
front of the oncoming stampede and hope that everyone has read the
script and knows not to try jumping over the fallen tree or to run
into it and cause a pile-up.  As for the forest fire, you have
Vector implement a firefighting solution worthy of Mike (Mr.
Science) Gallagher: have him point his itty-bitty headphones at the
fire and pump up the volume enabling him to not only blow out the
fire but send some saucers containing the DL tumbling.  Back when
I lived in Chicago, a morning radio guy named Johnny Brandmeier
used to have listeners crank up their car stereo speakers REAL
LOUD; that trick never put out any forest fires but it DID blow out
some speakers.  However, if you're an echidna named Knuckles you
let someone else worry about plausibility factor of these kind of
stunts while the editor worries about the next 

RDB note: reference my previous comment about accepting impossibilities but 
not implausibilities...

     QC to the Hall of Science, which is under attack by the DLes. 
Seems the assembled echidnas are beginning to think that
confiscation of private property may not have been the best idea
they ever had, as their society is about to slide into civil war. 
Some civil wars are fought over race, others over larger issues
such as religion or slavery; THIS one looks like it's going to be
about microwave ovens and garage door openers.  Steppenwolf then
enters to make his case and to lead us through three VERY scary
pages, though Ken and Kent probably didn't plan it that way. 
Steppenwolf barely opens his mouth when a member of the council
named Garak decides that echidna interests would best be served at
this point by his arranging a father-son reunion for Steppenwolf
and Edmund.  He pulls out a blaster that resembles a 1950's era tin
toy and points it as Steppenwolf, who walks up to point-blank range
and says in effect: "Go ahead; make your day."  The two stand
eyeball-to-eyeball and Garak blinks.  Having demonstrated his
spiritual superiority (or at least his ability to play poker),
Steppenwolf launches into some speech making.  It was probably
MEANT to sound heroic, having to do with unifying a torn society
and so forth.  What we GET, unfortunately, is something truly
spooky -- a speech that manages to combine elements of Bill Clinton
on the campaign trail (when he talks about building a bridge
between the factions) and Adolf Hitler at the Nuremberg Nazi Party
rallies (when he talks about accepting the "New Order").  While he
then advises the assembled echidnas to "choose wisely" he really
hasn't given them much to choose from: essentially, it's a choice
between Plan A and Plan A.  Which he's going to go out and implement 
anyway.  The High Councilor is so inspired by this nonsense that he 
actually manages to use the phrase "we shall overcome"; apparently 
he thinks he's in the middle of the Million Echidna March.
     Let's clarify something: Herman Hesse's 1927 psychological
novel "Steppenwolf" had to do with (among other things) the notion
that while most members of bourgeois society [insist] on viewing
themselves in a rigid manner that produces [sheeplike] behavior, only
those few individuals who can think of themselves in broader terms
can become the leaders of their fields.  Which is fine, except that
there's a dark side to this theme as well: the belief in the
providential leading of a strong solitary visionary.  This sort of
thing can be relatively harmless in the context of literature, such
as Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead" where overwhelming artistic ego
wears the disguise of high-minded devotion to principle.  When the
word is made flesh in the political sphere, however, the results
are likely to be a Hitler or a Stalin or a Pol Pot.  In this case,
Steppenwolf's words happened to be tempered by his deeds -- his not
taking action against Garak for wanting to part his dreadlocks with
a blaster.  The writers have still given voice to a dangerous
impulse, though, whether they meant to take the gamble or not. 
Frankly, I was glad when the sequence was over and we could 

RDB note: (not meant as a flame): so does all this literary knowledge 
enhance or detract from your enjoyment of the comic?  Having no such 
knowledge (I stuck to Tom Swift and the Hardy Boys growing up :^)), 
I just took the story at face value (such as it was...)  Again, not meant 
as a flame, but I almost think you know too much for your own good here :^|
Good commentary though, keep it up!

     QC to the Chaotix pulling themselves together, disguising
themselves in DL cloaks and swiping a few saucers.  They join a
bunch of other saucers to converge on a mushroom-shaped hanger of
some sort.  Whoever else is watching Knux and the gang, his father
and Archie are able to monitor the situation from within Haven. 
The two banter a bit before Archie is sent to him, while Knuckles'
dad refers to his kid as "our future guardian."  Since when did he
get put on probation?
     They land and follow the crowd to the Great Hall where Kragok
the Marginally Pronounceable tells the assembled multitude that
with "the last son of Edmund burned to a crisp" [I assume he's
speaking figuratively here], they will soon be in possession of the
Chaos Emerald.  That's Knuckles' cue to leap on stage and confront
Kragok...while we pause for an ad for junk food-flavored lip gloss,
the Fan Art page, and the by now superfluous "I want..." page.  All
this just before we
     QC to the past where, without any explanation or exposition,
we see Steppenwolf stepping up to confront the leader of the DL,
who turns out to be (to nobody's surprise) Menniker.  There follows
the Obligatory Bad Guy Exposition in which Menniker tells how he
sensed his dad trying to "send...a message"; apparently he didn't
realize that his old man was really in the process of morphing into
Enerjak and the message was "Could you please come up with a name
that doesn't sound so stupid?".  Anyway, Steppenwolf cuts this
whole business short by opening up some kind of space-time portal
in the sky which sucks up Menniker and the Legionnaires.  Since the
portal bears a resemblance to the one that deposited Kragok and his
boys into this story two issues ago, one wonders whether Kragok and
Menniker are the same.  Kragok never takes off his hood so there's
no way we can see if he has the distinctive echidna Mohawk or not. 
Anyway, we then do a
     SLOW DISSOLVE (!) from then to now as Knuckles and Kragok face
off.  There's about a page or two of fighting while Knuckles' dad
talks about how he blasted Dimitri/Enerjak into orbit in "Rites of
Passage" #3; he then goes into some kind of lotus position that
knocks out the Legion's weapons.  While Knuckles gives chase after
Kragok (just as Archie shows up), the Villain's Fortress Begins to
Self-Destruct (have you ever known one that DIDN'T?).  The Chaotix
and eventually Knuckles (whose quarry has eluded him) escape and on
that rather hollow note and accompanied by a quote from the Firesign 
Theater's celebrated "Nick Danger: Third Eye" routine, it's over.
     Very successful storytelling, in that the QC-ing back and
forth didn't manage to lose the reader.  

RDB note: speak for yourself :^)

The lapses in logic (the
fighting fire with headphones bit) are generally forgivable, though 
Ken and Kent could have taken a LITTLE effort to determine how
Steppenwolf escaped the saucer crash; as it is, it has the feel of
hack writing.  And the Team of Gala'n and Pepoy turn in EXTREMELY
impressive work.  Gala'n may have found his calling here, being to
Knuckles what Art Mawhinney is to Sonic.
     And speaking of Sonic, I have to ask: WHY does Ken seem to
have experienced a creative renaissance as a writer having moved on
to do Knuckles stories while the quality of the writing for Sonic
(and NOT just by Ken) is showing a decline?  And that goes for the
as-yet unfinished "Endgame" as well!  From what we've seen in the
Knuckles' series and from what's to come--based on things he told
me at the Motor City Comic Con--NOT writing for Sonic seems to
agree with him.  Has the blue blur burned him out?  Is he so
resentful of the canonicity of the SatAM cartoon that he finds
Knuckles to be a kind of "tabula rasa"--a "clean slate" on which he
can work with a freer hand?  I can't say.  I can only hope that the
talent will be spread around and that Knuckles' success won't come
at the expense of the Sonic line; otherwise, the Brave New World is
going to have a shorter shelf-life than the OLD one!

#50 [Sep 1997]
     "The Big Goodbye" [Endgame: Part 4]
     Cooks: Too many.
     Pat Spaziante/Ken Penders computer-rendered cover.  Looks WAY
more impressive than the images I've seen online.  One MORE reason
not to trust the preview publications.
     FOR THE NEWBIES: If you're just joining us, please keep in
mind that Ken Penders designed this story to run 40 pages, as part
of what was planned to be a 48-page "Special" for Sonic #50. 
SOMEWHERE along the way, though, that number got cut back by
something like 40%!  PLEASE keep that fact in mind as it will help
explain some of the...uh...UNIQUE aspects of pacing, timing, and
plotting in this story.
     Ladies and gentlemen, this match has a 27 page limit.  Let's
get ready to FUMBLE!
     First on the card is the Art Mawhinney/Andrew Pepoy splash
page.  No, I didn't bother reading it.  Yes, I tried following the
ComBot's 4-bank shot that set Antoine's toupee on fire.  Why does
this remind me of a "Mad Magazine" PARODY of a Sonic comic?  The
artist might as well have been Jack Davis, Mort Drucker, or Sergio
Aragones.  Then again, given the number of artists taking part in THIS 
turkey shoot, maybe one of Mad's "usual gang of idiots" DID draw this.
     First into the ring on page 1: the team of Penders (story),
Spaziante (pencil), and Pepoy (ink).  You think Robotnik had a
cheesy moustache before, wait'll you see the one he's sporting
here: looks like he's got a couple mice jammed up his nose.  He's
apparently on the run from two humanoids with names (one borrowed,
one botched) from "Babylon 5".  ALREADY with the in-jokes! 
Could've been worse; they MIGHT have been named Sculley and Muldar. 
Anyway, they're hunting "Julian, son of Ivo" to bring him back to
"the minister", and I don't think it's because he stood up the
bride at a wedding.  He lands face-first in a mud hole and manages
to avoid being noticed by the two humans (neat trick for something
THAT bulky!) but he IS found by Jules and Charles, a couple blue
hedgehogs.  Jules is the one with the improbable shock of brown
hair growing out of his forehead like a unicorn's horn.  Against
[Charles's] better judgment, Julian is presented to the King and (in
a thankless cameo) the Warlord Kodos last seen in "The Dream Zone"
(#43).  Fat Boy appears ready to spill his guts (no small task)
concerning what he knows about the humans with which the animals
are at war.  That's right: the Great War was Overlanders vs.
Mobians, Skins vs. Furs.  The Mobians take this sizable serpent
into their bosom; Julian grows a bad moustache.
     Well, THAT was interesting.  And pointless!  Fact is, that
little 3-page digression had NOTHING AT ALL to do with the Endgame
story arc to date, let alone this installment.  It's three wasted
pages, and since Ken had so many pages cut out from under him he
needed all the help he could get.  Leaving them in was a huge
mistake.  The sequence served about as much purpose (in this
context) as would a scene of Bunnie dropping her top and flashing
her hoo-ha's: maybe it's something a number of fans would like to
see, but what business does it have HERE?
     Page 4: Penders tags in Mike Gallagher and Spaziante tags in
Manny Galan.  We're back where we left off last issue (which REALLY
underscores how useless that Great War bit was).  Sonic tries to
talk Knuckles into helping him, but Geoffrey St. John tells Knux
that Sonic is "Princess Sally's assassin."  Sonic eludes Knuckles
but Espio decloaks and seizes him so Geoff's gopher henchmen can
tie him up.  Their names, BTW, are "Smiley" and "Fleming"; great,
we're using allusions to spy novels now!  Anyway, Dulcy (whom
Knuckles clobbered in the last ish) comes to and puts her foot
down.  Her word is instantly taken as gospel truth and Geoff
finally realizes there's a divide-and-conquer thing happening here. 
     Page 7: Nelson Ortega in for Galan, Brian Thomas in for Pepoy. 
Tails and Rotor manage to elude the furry round-up back at
Knothole.  They climb down a ladder (in a VERY nicely drawn panel,
BTW) to the underground pier, only to find that Drago got there
first and scuttled the Sea Fox and Rotor's bathysphere.
     Meanwhile, Robotnik is informed by an off-model CrocBot that
despite the fact that "the mineral ore" is on its way to him
there's been a riot at the prison camp.  Hope you were paying
attention just now because [that's] about ALL the exposition you're
going to get to explain what happens to the Downunda subplot. 
Couldn't [they?] have spared ONE LOUSY PAGE from the Prologue to help 
the narrative along?  Might as well not have sent Antoine and Bunnie
there at all.
     Rotor and Tails are being herded into Model A roboticizers --
the kind from the first Sonic game -- when Sonic, Knux and Geoff
get the drop on their captors by jumping out of a plane.  Knuckles
wins the Iron Man title by NOT using a parachute.
     Page 10: Brand new team (Karl Bollers for script, Sam Maxwell
for pencil, Pam Eklund for inking) but the same old fight sequence. 
Maxwell's style is, of course, a kick in the old continuity;
Knuckles looks like he's reverting to ancestral type and is about
to turn into an anteater.  As for the balloon-headed Sonic, he
decides to single out Drago for no particular reason; lacking any
real exposition, we can only ASSUME that Geoff clued Sonic in on
the way back.  The wolf beats feet...
     Page 12: and becomes WAY more detailed as Dave Manak tags in
for Sam Maxwell.  Before Sonic can bring Drago down, however, the
wolf's hit in the head with a rock thrown by...Hershey!  With no
apparent motivation, she's suddenly stopped being Drago's punching
bag.  Gee, it took someone in my family six months of sobriety and
a LOT of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings before she could stand up to
HER abusive spouse.  Hershey then confesses her part in Sally's
demise to Sonic.  Frankly, her confession would be more convincing
if she didn't look like she was trying to worf up a hairball.  Two
words for Manak's depiction of Hershey: "Ugh lee!"  Let's see, she
went from Mawhinney/androgynous in #47 to Galan/large-eyed and
babe-ular in #48 to Maxwell/rubbery in #49 to Manak/what the cat
dragged in here.  This kid's had more changes of appearance than
Michael Jackson!  Anyway, Sonic decides that Hershey's not to
blame.  Robotnik, meanwhile, gets the old good news/bad news
routine.  The good news is that the Downunda ore has arrived; the
bad news is that we get to see an extreme close-up of his face.
     Page 14: Penders back in to relieve Manak, and not a moment
too soon.  Robotnik's not only got bats in his belfry, but a bunny
in his rafters.  Bunnie and Antoine offer only a tenuous exposition
as to how they went from being chained up in Downunda to back in
Robotnik's HQ.  Let's not dwell on this and move along.  Speaking
of moving along, Sonic is seen approaching Robotnik's fortress or
whatever it is.  The events of the story arc have so addled his
brain that he begins speaking in tongues: "If I modulate the
frequency of my speed while I run real fast...I should be able to
create after-images of myself" in order to confuse the incoming
missiles.  All this Treknobabble could have been avoided with a
simple: "Hey, I'm SONIC; I'll just outrun those slow-mo [missiles]!" 
But by now it should be clear that NOTHING is going to be simple
about this story.
     Page 16: Once again a whole new team: Kent Taylor in for
story, Sam Maxwell in for pencil, Harve Mercadoocasio in for ink,
the reader in for a hard time.  Sonic (I guess) crashes through a
door and (I think) gets tangled up by (what I guess are) flying
gloves with cables fired by Snively (or something) who's also
shooting Sonic with some liquid that looks like either pea soup or
pea soup.  Pages 16 and 17 are just a mess; I haven't been this
confused since the last time I tried constructing a macro in
WordPerfect 6.  Sonic knocks Snively out anyway and runs into a
VERY underdrawn Bunnie and Antoine; it's almost as if Maxwell
didn't so much draw them as squeeze them in.  You can only see half
their faces at any given time if you see them at all, but
considering that this is Sam Maxwell we're talking about, count
your blessings.  The two inform Sonic that they've planted a bomb
in Robotnik's war room; Sonic tells them to scoot while he
continues on toward his F2F {face to face} with Robotnik.  We are 
once again treated to an "uncharacteristic" Sonic "devoid of humor" --
translation: Kent Taylor couldn't think of anything funny to write. 
     Page 19: Spaz back in for Maxwell, Sonic in for a beating.  He
can't do much against Robotnik at close quarters (it says here),
but when Robotnik tries activating his wonder weapon it tells him
that the system is going down, it will destroy the war room instead
of Knothole, and he'd better save his work to a different file. 
Despite our being told that "all is said and done" between the two,
they keep on doing anyway: i.e., beating on each other in a blur of
speed lines and jazzy visuals as likely to give the two of them
(and the reader) a headache as much as anything else.
     Page 22: OK, THAT was a mess!  Let's bring in Penders as
writer, Art Mawhinney as penciller, and Rich Koslowski as inker and
try to bring order out of this chaos.  Sonic gets sucked into some
vortex or other, complains about being tired and passes out. 
Someone observes that he needs medical attention.  Duh!
     Page 23: Hmmm.  Let's bring in Jim Amash to substitute for
Koslowski and try again.  Pay close attention, PLEASE, I don't want
to have to repeat myself.  Sonic may have needed medical attention
but he has to settle for Dr. Quack instead.  He tells Sonic that
he's in the "medical facility" back in Knothole -- said facility is
looking WAY more rustic than it did back in "The Dream Zone."  Sonic
says he "saw Knothole destroyed!"  Hang on a sec...gee, I guess he
was the only one. *I* didn't see any such thing...unless said
destruction found its way to the cutting room floor.  Now it's
Rotor's turn to start with the Treknobabble: According to him [and
this kind of cockeyed explanation DESERVES to be quoted at length],
Knothole now "exists in a temporal rift three hours in the future". 
I guess that means Sonic will have to watch his show on the USA
Network at 4:00 in the morning instead of 7:00.  Or something.  HOW
Rotor came to this hare-brained conclusion is never explained.  He
also states that "many zones were created when Robotnik unleashed
his device."  Presumably he means the device that had its wires
crossed and blew up the War Room instead of wasting Knothole.  This
script had FOUR writers working on it; my guess is that by this
point J. Freddy Gabrie was just as confused as we are and in his
capacity as editor didn't catch the apparent contradiction. 
Anyway, you might want to keep that business about the many zones
in mind; I think they're going to use that as a handy excuse for
some future plots.
     Quack now supplies a LOT of exposition which, when you boil it
down and remove the scum from the top, goes something like this:
back in #43 when Quack used the Glorified Gumball Machine in "The
Dream Zone", Robotnik was somehow able to home in on the "neutron
chip" inside and finally get a fix on Knothole's location.  While
we were diverted by looking at Sam Maxwell's abominable artwork in
"Battle Royal", Robotnik's bots showed up, switched the King with
a bot double and kidnapped the doc.  With his family as hostages,
he had to play along.  At the same time, he noticed that Drago was
setting up Sally to buy the harp farm and...OK, I'm not sure what
the following means but here it is in full:

     [Robotnik's] nephew Snively had other plans.  I noticed he
     altered the neutron eradicator to affect only one organic
     pattern out of the many originally programmed...only Robotnik
     could now be affected by the device.

So that means that...frankly, I don't know WHAT that means or WHERE
this "neutron eradicator" (which MAY or MAY NOT be the same as the
"Ultimate Annihilator") fits into the plot.  Anyone with the
slightest idea PLEASE contact me at drazen@andrews.edu.  Sonic is
just as confused as I am and, to change the subject, asks about Sally.
     Page 25: Koslowski back in to sling the ink.  The doc tells
Sonic that she "nearly died" from the fall (looked convincing to ME!) 
and has been placed in a "stasis tube" "so she could heal and recover."  
Sorry, Ken, but I went straight to The Good Book at this point: Michael 
Okuda's _Star_Trek_Encyclopedia_, wherein I learned that a "stasis unit" 
"hold[s] a patient in a state of suspended animation UNTIL MEDICAL TREATMENT 
COULD BE RENDERED." [Emphasis mine] So Sally wouldn't be getting better OR 
worse inside the thing.  The doc then goes on to tell Sonic that she's in a
coma "and I couldn't tell you when or even if she'll come out of it."  Sonic 
is tired of Quack talking out of both sides of his bill and dashes off.
     Page 26: HOLY MOTHER OF DISNEY!!!  We're in the middle of a
"Snow White" remake!  Sonic has apparently seen the movie so he
opens the stasis unit, gives Sally a peck on the cheek, says 
"I love you, Sally!  Please come back"...
     ...and she wakes up.
     That's IT??  The culmination of all those months of teasing
the angle, all those flames, all those posts, all that speculation,
all that fan art of Sally with wings and a halo, all those tributes
sent to the Cybershrine?  It wasn't even a KISS, furcryinoutloud! 
I happened to get my copy of #50 in the mail on June 16 [the most
timely I've ever received it, I might add], the same day USA reran
"The Doomsday Project."  THAT episode culminated in Sonic and Sally
engaging in a kiss that was a KISS!  Eyes closed, lips locked,
Sally with one foot raised off the ground, an [unmistakeable]
unambiguous spit-swapping tongue-probing tonsil-poking I'm-about-
to-lose-control-but-I-think-I-like-it communion of SOULS!!!  Here,
Sonic gives Sally the kind of kiss she would have gotten from her
GRANDFATHER!  And you know what was the most infuriating thing of
all?  Mawhinney's drawing of Sonic.  I can't believe I'm writing
this, but Mawhinney totally dropped the ball here!  No tear in
Sonic's eye, no turning away from the sight of Sally laid out
because it's just too painful; all we get is Sonic with a basically
flat [affectation].  Mawhinney is TOO GOOD of an artist to have missed 
the chance to really bust out with something heartfelt and operatic,
something that would have cranked the intensity a couple notches
above even the Spaziante fight scenes on pages 19-21!  Personally
I blame the Sega Superego for keeping the lid on tight and ruining
what should have been the crowning moment of the whole sorry story arc.
     Page [27]: The Sega Thought Police drag Mawhinney away kicking
and screaming before he can produce some artwork that might
actually get an emotional rise out of the fans, so Spaziante steps
in and Ken handles both the writing and the inking on your basic
Dragnet/American Graffitti-type ending.   Sonic and Sally are shown
trying to embrace while keeping at arms' length from each other,
like a couple of preadolescents at a Catholic school dance;
apparently the Sega chaperone nuns are all over the place with
rulers at the ready.  The ending tells you what loose ends got tied
up and ignores the ones that didn't.  Freddy once again hews to the
party line and calls this story arc a "runaway roller coaster ride." 
I'll have more to say about THAT in a little bit, but first, after
having looked at Scott Shaw!'s contribution to this issue (one
drawing; thanks a lot, Scott), allow me to preface my comments
about "Endgame" with the following excerpt from Jean Kerr's _The
Snake Has All The Lines_:

     ...a friend of mine..one Easter...had to prepare dinner for
     fifteen people, counting children and relatives.  For reasons
     of economy she decided to make a ham loaf instead of the
     traditional baked ham.  Obviously it was going to be four
     times the trouble, since the recipe for the ham loaf was
     extremely elaborate: there were a dozen different ingredients
     and the whole thing had to be made in advance and allowed to
     "set" overnight in pineapple juice.  But she went gamely ahead,
     convinced that she was going to produce something tastier than
     baked ham, if not indeed a gourmet's dish.  As she took the
     square pink loaf out of the oven, a sinister thought crossed
     her mind.  She cut off a little slice and tasted it, her worst
     suspicions confirmed.  In tears she flew out of the kitchen to
     find her husband.  "Oh, Frank," she said, "do you know what
     I've GOT?  I've got Spam!"

I think it's safe to say at this point that neither Ken Penders,
J. Freddy Gabrie, nor anyone else at Archie Comics, PLANNED for
"Endgame" to come out the way it did.  To have that happen to a
story is, in fact, one of the worst fates that can befall a writer. 
So before we go any further I wish to publicly apologize to Ken
Penders for any untoward things I may have said since last
September when he broke the news about "Endgame" on the Net. 
Further, I believe that all Penders-bashing should come to an
immediate halt.  The man has suffered enough just by witnessing
what has become of his story.

RDB note: I'm tempted to wonder about bashing him for his _original_ plan 
for the story (no smiley, but I'm not _too_ serious about that...)

     So what DID happen?  I don't expect anyone at Archie to post
something to the lists saying "OK, we blew it big times and here's
where we went wrong...."  Besides, if they did that we critics
would be out of a job!  So let me count the ways:
     1. THE HOOK. "Endgame" had a hook, something to grab the
reader's interest and keep it focused throughout.  In this case the
hook was supposed to be: "Did Sonic really kill Sally?" 
Unfortunately, by the end of #47 it was plain that the readers were
ready to answer "No way!"  The absence of the backpack straps on the
"Sonic" who did the nasty was a (forgive the pun) dead giveaway. 
So the focus shifted to another hook: "Is Sally really dead?"  That,
too was a good hook.  A VERY good hook.  In fact, it was TOO good
of a hook.  It shifted the focus for a lot of fans OFF OF SONIC
ALTOGETHER!  They KNEW he would elude capture; it was only a question 
of HOW (or, more specifically, how LAME would the means of escape be).
     But the ambiguity over Sally's demise created a fan frenzy in
some quarters.  I certainly sensed it at THIS end of the Net, and
that's why I set up the Princess Sally Memorial Cybershrine: as a
place for fans to vent their grief and loss.  Frankly even I was
surprised at times at the intensity of feelings expressed.  But
only now is it clear that by fudging on Sally's death, Ken [inadvertently] 
moved it to center stage.  It was self-sabotage, pure and simple.
     2. PACING.  "Endgame" should have followed the elementary
three-step progression of so many stories of this kind:

     I.   Something bad happens to the hero
     II.  Hero gets it together
     III. Hero triumphs

All neat and tidy in three acts.
     So what happened here?  For one thing, despite the much-touted
roller coaster analogy, "Endgame" ended up more like one of those
thrill rides which hoist you hunderds of feet to the top of some
tower or other and then you DROP until you level off back at ground
level.  There was no rise and fall, no emotional flow here, or if
there was it was mostly in one direction.  The four parts of the
arc can be summarized thus:

     I.   Something really bad happens to Sonic
     II.  Bad stuff continues to happen to Sonic (and to his friends)
     III. See II
     IV.  A WHOLE LOTTA stuff happens to Sonic and everybody and
          then the story just kinda ends

Which brings me to my next point:
     3. EDITING.  I don't know the circumstances under which 
Ken went ahead and planned a 40-page finale for "Endgame" only 
to have it cut back by almost half.  When I first heard of this
development, I couldn't help but think of Ronald Reagan in one of
his better film roles, as a soldier waking up in an Army hospital
who realizes that both of his legs have been amputated and who
begins screaming: "WHERE'S THE REST OF ME!?"  Ken then had to fall
back on what he called in one post "judicious editing" to turn the
jigsaw puzzle that #50 had become into a coherent climax to the
story arc.  From some of my comments above, it would appear he
wasn't totally successful, which should come as no surprise.
     And then there was the "a priori editing" that took place (my
little euphemism for Sega's censorship of the stories).  It really
showed up in what was supposed to be the showpiece of the story:
Sonic and Sally reunited.  Sonic's flat [affectation], the tentative kiss,
the arm's length embrace; this was no way to reunite two creatures
supposedly in love with each other no matter how unsure they may
have been about expressing it in the past.  I kept thinking of a
line by Bart Simpson: "Milhouse, we're living in the age of
cooties; I can't believe the risks you're taking!"  Can ANY of the
Archie writers turn out believable material with THIS kind of
mentality leading the way?
     4. GIMMICKRY.  I first had a bad feeling about #50 when I
heard about the tag team...er..."all-star jam" approach taken toward
illustrating the story.  It wasn't THAT bad, as it turned out, but
it was bad enough in some cases; Hershey in particular was ill-
served.  Likewise the interplay of four writers on this story, as
well as having two writers team up each on #48 and #49.  This was 
the last nail in the "Endgame" coffin.
     This story arc required...DEMANDED...a steady and consistent
hand, a unified vision of where it was going and an unwavering
visual approach.  The trade-off of writers and artists subverted
that requirement, replacing basic meat-and-potatoes narrative
structure and artictic unity with what resulted in a free-for-all. 
Team efforts have worked before: much of Ken Penders' collaborative
work with Mike Kanterovich was brilliant.  This, however, was a
failure of the collaborative process.  Instead of a reasoned,
coherent approach to the material, the reader saw one bad angle
piled on top of another: Sally was killed by Hershey wearing a
phony-looking Sonic mask; Sonic escapes certain doom by running
across a bridge made by a handful of dirt; Sally survives a fall
that was supposed to have killed her and goes into a coma which is
so mild she's awakened with an equally mild kiss.  Readers can
suspend disbelief for only so long.
     And as I've pointed out before, the irony is that the same Ken
Penders who put THIS together seems to be producing coherent,
powerful work for the Knuckles line.  I have no idea what the
"Brave New World" will hold for Sonic, but I have a bad feeling
about the High Concept "Mask"-meets-"Casablanca" plot for #52.  That
kind of storytelling signals a drift away from the basics, away
from the ability to produce readable, engaging stories in favor of
cheap jokes and cultural grave-robbing.  It had better NOT be an
indication of a long-term trend, or else Sonic WON'T last another
50 issues.
     So, what's the last word on "Endgame"?  Well, a good writer
should always be ready to admit it when someone else has said
something far better than he/she ever could.  So I'll let Ken
Penders have the final say here (with an assist from Messers
Kanterovich and Mawhinney).  If you're reading this on my Sonic
Website, you'll find it in the Archives section of the "Knothole
Knews" where I've stored some of my past reviews.  If you can't get
there or it you prefer to deal with hard copy, just look in the second 
issue of the Knuckles miniseries "Rites of Passage", page 11,panel 8.

It's what Archimedes says to Knuckles after the latter tried to make a meal 
of the former, and I agree :^|


#51 [Oct 1997]

NOTE: If you're new to this group, I'd better warn you that this
review WILL contain spoilers.  Of course if you're a REAL newbie,
you won't know what a "spoiler" is, anyway, so never mind...

     Spaz/Harvo cover: A little cluttered but a good design.  Too
bad someone seems to have gotten training in Adobe Photoshop 4.0
or some such program recently and felt compelled to use all the
new tricks they're learning.  The transparent confetti is a nice
touch but there's also a little too much use of the gradient tool
resulting in blurriness in the foreground and in Tails' party
favor or spinner or whatever.  Dulcy suffered from the same
problem on the cover of #49; at the time, I thought I just needed
new glasses.  And this must have been laid out by a computer as
well because the stair stepping around Amy Rose's eyes is REALLY
noticeable.  As depressing as the subject matter of the cover of
#47 was, at least the lines were clean.  Speaking of depressing,
Rotor appears to be contemplating his impending demotion along
with that of the rest of the secondary characters.  Oh well, it's
also his party and he'll cry if he wants to.  That's more emotion
than Sonic got to show through the whole of "Endgame", but never
mind.  And to all those who scoured the preview media and could
have sworn that was Hershey on the cover...GOTCHA!  Paul
Castiglia admitted that they couldn't show the final cover for
#51 while the "Endgame" arc was still running, so in order to
keep the ending under wraps they submitted a dummy cover.  And if
you believed it you now know WHY it's called a "dummy
cover"...dummy!  But Hershey DID make the front cover after
all...the INSIDE front cover.  Paid for the whole thing!  At this
rate, expect the next new regular character to be named "Quaker."
     Splash page: remember the good old days when you could
actually SEE the splash pages?  And you didn't have to fight your
way through a jungle of text?  Remember when they helped set the
mood for the story (the most sublime example being the Spaz
splash page in #43), rather than being mere wallpaper for
someone's text?  Do you remember?  Because if you don't, they're
just going to keep on doing things like this at Archie and it's
really starting to get annoying!
     "Reality Bytes"
     Ordinarily, this is where the credits would appear. 
However, that minor detail seems to have gotten past someone;
there is NO sign ANYWHERE of who is responsible for this story. 
The Sam Maxwell art style is unmistakable, but the writer prefers
to remain unknown (or simply blameless).  Was the Archie crew
just so exhausted from working on "Endgame" that they forgot?  Or
perhaps it's like the scene in "Continental Divide" where two of
Chicago's finest make sure they're not wearing their badges
before they carry out an alderman's orders and start pounding on
the character played by John Belushi.  No badges, no badge
numbers, no way of knowing who did the deed.

RDB note: before everybody replies with the author, see Dan's last line below...

     Well, I've done so much gabbing it looks like the party's
already winding down.  That's the trouble with living in the year
3235: they've forgotten how to party like it's 1999.  Actually,
the core Freedom Fighters have stepped away from the festivities
to bestow a special medal of some sort on Sonic.  Sonic is
awakened later in the evening by Sally, who speaks of some kind
of secret mission.  Turns out the secret is that Sally's
overdosed on the eye liner and is suddenly sporting a set of red
contact lenses.  Oh, and she also set up a Com-bot ambush.  Sonic
dodges the weapons fire and heads back for Knothole, while Sally
morphs into a REALLY ugly-looking bot.  Someone better lend Sam
some stills from "Sonic's Nightmare"; at least in THAT one the
Sally bot looked decent.
     Tails suddenly arrives to airlift Sonic out of harm's way
and to give him the old good news/bad news routine: the bad news
is, "someone's taken over" for Robotnik and Sally was his first
victim; the worst news is, we get subjected to a gratuitous
Arnold impersonation from Tails (since we'll probably be up to
our Maltese falcons in bogus Bogart impressions in next month's
issue, consider this a warm-up exercise).  An image of Uncle
Chuck appears and disappears in front of Sonic, who then notices
an approaching Buzzbomber and a Crab-whatever below (OK, so I
don't know from the games; I'll admit it).  That's the cue for
Tails to come down with a case of red eye and to let his big bro
down, literally!  Sonic lands with a convincing THOOM that leaves
an enormous crater and no sign of our hero.  At least until we
get to page 10 where we find Sonic burrowing away underground. 
He sees another manifestation of Uncle Chuck and reacts to it in
the same way Dracula might react to a slice of garlic-crust
pizza.  Emerging near the "hot spring" he finds Bunnie, who's in
a bad way: she appears to have blown a serious gasket, and she's
even lost her accent.  Nice design, very cute...until SHE starts
in with the red eye thing.  Let's see, Sally morphs, Sonic
escapes; Tails morphs, Sonic escapes; Bunnie morphs...do I really
have to finish the sentence?  Even Sonic is getting bored by the
repetition and starts yawning on the top of page 12.  He comes
across a power ring, but is unable to pull it out of the water. 

RDB note: that's what it looks like, but maybe he's just really bummed out 
by it not having any power...

At least until Bunnie shows up, whereupon he uses it as a
restraint and says: "You've got a ring for a straight-jacket! 
And I'm ghost!"  Either I was on vacation when that phrase came
into use, or else the writer and letterer suffered a
communication breakdown.  
     Sonic finally makes it to Knothole, but while in the home
stretch he runs into the Uncle Chuck image who's now speaking in
tongues.  A transcript: "Hikaske on hukenox am yoque!  Keneg nid
trembo, Sonic!"  Yeah, and a "Klaatu borada nikto" to you, too, Unc!

RDB note: I was going to make a comment about the intro to ELO's Face the 
Music and point to a web page that un-back-masked it, but the link is 
obsolete... :^(  (.wav available though if anybody wants it...)

     Let's take a break.  Fan art: ALL RIGHT!!!  Major kudos to
Hysteria for showing these amateurs how it's done!  I REALLY like
the drawing: looks like a bunch of characters played by furries
over on HumanMuck.  I saw the drawing on the Scatterstar
Galactica Productions Website
[http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7579/home-sgp.htm] and wondered
how it'd look colored in.  Archie saved me the trouble; thanks. 
And the "Find Your Name..." page.  Notice how most of the names
in the left-hand column display the ages, and most of the ages
appear to belong in the 10-13 range; think Archie's trying to
tell us something?
     Back to the action: Sonic arrives in Knothole, only to
discover Robotnik (with Cluck, no less!) is part of the reception
committee.  "Whoops apocalypse"?  OK, find the "bad pun" in the
following dialogue: "Ah, Sonic!  I've waited for this moment a
long time!  I finally have Knothole...and now I've captured you,
as well, despite your valiant efforts!  How does it feel to have
egg on your face?"  Yeah, I couldn't find it, either.  Maybe he
meant to say "egg IN your face".  Anyway, Robotnik tries
convincing Sonic to give himself up since "all of your friends
have seen the light", and it's glowing a dull red.  The
roboticized Mobians start chanting "Join us!" like stoned
teenagers in a bad hippie movie or something.  Sonic struggles
with the prospect of Robotnik "overtaking" Knothole.  Hold on, I
know that should be "taking over", but the word play's not over
yet.  As he struggles between the situation and remembering the
good times, everyone starts derezzing as Robotnik yells "Hanend
du nagun?!" which sounds like he just realized that he's
forgotten to schedule time at the sauna.  There's an extreme
close-up of Sonic's baby browns and...
     We're back in Sonic's bedroom where it appears that Uncle
Chuck is trying to jump-start his nephew's brain.  Uncle Chuck is
still suffering from dyslexia for he says "If you had said
'nightmare' you'd had been [instead of "you'd have been"] closer
to the truth."  He then explains that Sonic's medal "was booby-
trapped with an artificial virus that threw you into a virtual-
reality nightmare..."  Which makes no sense at all if you know
anything about computer viruses, REAL viruses, virtual reality,
artificial intelligence, or dreaming, but it probably SOUNDS
convincing if you're between the ages of 10 and 13.  Sonic sums
up the situation by saying: "What a kick in the pants that would
be if Robotnik had scored from beyond the grave."  Hey, Sonic,
let's leave Robotnik's wardrobe AND his love life out of this, 'kay?  
But Uncle Chuck maintains that Robotnik "had nothing to do this!"  
     Well, that's a cheap, ambiguous ending to this gratuitous
little story.  All that running around and we wind up with the
Old Dream Ending -- the hack writer's best friend.  No wonder the
author insisted on anonymity!  Maxwell's art is as uneven as
ever, especially when drawing roboticized Mobians.  Instead of
looking menacing, they just look seedy.  But that's hardly the
most telling aspect of this story.
     I don't know if we've ever been treated to a view of Sonic's
bedroom before, but I consider the race car bed to be on a par
with the line about "loose continuity" on the Sonic-Grams page in
#49: a small detail that gives the game away -- in this case, an
indicator of which direction the comic is headed.
     One of the earliest questions I had to deal with when I
began working on the Sonic FAQ File all those years ago was:
"What are the ages of the characters?"  Despite conflicting
versions in the comics and the SatAM cartoon, Sonic's age was
usually pegged at 15 in the comics and 16 in the cartoon.  OK,
we're safely talking mid-teens here, early high school.  So let
me ask you: What self-respecting high school-age guy would STILL
BE SLEEPING IN A RACE CAR BED?  Back in my high school, any kid
in such a situation would have been pantsed [wedgied?] by the Auto 
Shop punks and thrown into the girls' locker room on a regular basis. 
We're not exactly talking "role model behavior" here.  Unless you
DO still sleep in a race car bed, in which case you're more
likely to be a pre-teen than a teen.
     THAT is where Sonic appears to be heading.  If you want to
talk video games, let's talk "Space Ace", because it looks like
Sonic is getting dosed with the Infanto Ray!  It may be too soon
to tell; SONIC: BRAVE NEW WORLD will be a better indicator.  But
it's beginning to appear that in the aftermath of the "Endgame"
incident, Archie has decided to adjust their publishing to match
their demographics.  Ken Penders (in a post he sent out before
leaving for the San Diego Comic Con) left the impression that
there was pretty much a balance in fan reaction of those who
didn't want Sally to die and those who wanted Sally out of the
picture (presumably so she wouldn't infect Sonic with cooties). 
So with Solomon-like wisdom the honchos at Archie have decided to
cut the baby in half: Sonic seems destined to regress into a blue
Tom Sawyer while Knuckles is busy with weightier matters (and if
you've let your mind wander while meditating on the splash page
for Knuckles #5 you get an idea of HOW weighty things could get!).  
     Speaking of Knuckles, Archie devoted FOUR FULL PAGES of this
issue to advertisements for its different publications and other
stuff -- everything from Archie digests to "romance novels" to
fanny packs.  And yet NOWHERE in ANY of the SIX DIFFERENT
advertisements is there ANYTHING about subscribing to Knuckles! 
It's as if the title stopped with the "Dark Legion" miniseries. 
This is ridiculous!  If I hadn't sent an e-mail to Paul Castiglia
I'd still be waiting for an announcement that the "Lost Paradise"
miniseries is finally available.  As it is, NOW I'm simply waiting 
for the "Lost Paradise" miniseries to get here one issue at a time.
     Sonic-Grams: But they DO show a thumb-nail of the cover of
Knuckles #6, as well as thumb-nails for "Brave New World" and
Sonic #52.  BTW, the picture of the cover of #52 as shown in the
back of Knuckles #5 (which I browsed in a local store) is WAY
better -- a black-and-white drawing of Sonic.  Looks much more
"film noir."  If nothing else, I plan to scan it in at some point
and add it to my Website, next to the link to my Sonic parody
story, "My Quills Are Quick."  But if the story in #52 is based
in part on "Casablanca", why is Sonic dressed like Bogie in "The
Maltese Falcon" or "The Big Sleep"?  The only time Bogart wore the
trenchcoat in "Casablanca" was when he was delivering those great
lines to Ingrid Bergman on the tarmac: "If you're not on that
plane...you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon and for the rest of your life...We'll always have
Paris...Where I'm going you can't follow, what I have to do you
can't be any part of...I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't
take much to see that the problems of three little people don't
amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world...Here's lookin' at
you, kid."  Sorry, got carried away there, but dang, that's
WRITING!!!  Somehow, it means more than having a 4-year-old
write: "Dear Sonic, you are cool!"  But we're slowly taking over,
cyberfans!  Green Gibbon gets his letter printed (paying homage
to Yuji Naka), while Juan Lara gets credit for guessing the
Disney ending.  In any event, they write better than Freddy:
"Tons of stuff is happening...A climaxing continuation...[hey,
HEY!, I thought this was turning into a KIDS comic!]...he steps
into a zone that must be seen for yourself...."  I'll admit I've
written lines like that, but it was usually 4:00 in the morning
on a day that a term paper was due.  Keneg nid trembo, Fred. 
(BTW, according to the PR blurb for #51 in Knuckles #5, Karl Bollers
was the writer of record for "Reality Bytes.").

Knuckles #4 [Aug 1997]
     Cover Art: Spaziante/Penders triptych.  Nice if you're into
an Impressionist phase, but doesn't give a clue as to what's
inside.  With any luck they'll drop the triptych motif next year
when Knuckles becomes a proper monthly.
     OK, HERE'S an innovation worth mentioning: the Spaz/Harvo
"cameo" (for lack of a better term -- if there's a real name for
it, I await enlightenment) on page...well, it's two pages before
Page 1 so that means that this is page I and that the splash page
is page ii.  Good design, nice composition, very dynamic in its way.  
Just about makes up for...
     The splash page.  Interesting...what I could see of it! 
Don't get me started.
     "Lost Paradise: Part 1: The Phantom City"
     "Ken Penders: Writers" -- OK, we now know that human cloning
IS possible!  Manny Galan: Penciler; Andrew Pepoy: Inker.
     Kids, don't try this at home: Vector is under water
listening to the soundtrack of "The Little Mermaid" on his
WalkCroc and carrying his shoes on his belt, apparently because
he likes the idea of swimming with dead weight, and the better to
guarantee a case of trench foot when he puts them back on.  

RDB note: better that than the jock itch from doing the same thing with 
underwear :^)

Of course, he's also wearing white gloves.  Proof once again that
even furries who don't HAVE fur are Not Clear On The Concept of
clothing.  However, he interrupts his Esther Williams
impersonation after he notices a suspicious shadow along the
riverbank.  After a nice full face shot of Vector looking out
from the water, he leaps out of the river (having put his shoes
back on at some point) and lunges at what appears to be a member
of the Dark Legion left over from the last miniseries.  Vector's
jive talkin' motivates the Legionnaire who softens up Vector quite 
handily, but before he can be turned into a wallet the stranger 
indicates that someone else on the island has got a date with a taser.
     Hurrying past a Captain Crunch ad, we find Knuckles "in
pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment."  Here's some
enlightenment for you, Knuckles: it's pronounced "Om!" 
Archimedes breaks off his criticism of Knuckles' meditation
technique to point out the would-be assailant.  Knuckles and the
assailant mix it up for two pages until we discover that he's
been fighting with...THE ECHIDNA VERSION OF ELIZABETH TAYLOR!  
I guess it's those violet eyes.
     Well, it had to happen at some point.  The Knuckles saga has
been pretty stag up until now, what with all the male bonding
going on with Knux and the Chaotix.  We finally get to see some
equal opportunity slugging, because the first thing she does on
page 8 is sucker punch Knuckles and reach for the taser.  No
doubt about it, what we have here is a "meet cute."
     A "meet cute" is Hollywood shorthand for a boy-meets-girl
set-up that telegraphs the message that however inauspicious
their meeting, these two will end up falling in love with each
other by the end of the picture.  The key to a good "meet cute"
is disaster: the worse things get for the couple, the more likely
they'll be to fall into each other's arms at some point.  The scene 
in the beginning of "101 Dalmatians" involving Pongo's master and 
Perdita's mistress in the park is classic "meet cute" material.  

RDB note: so is Danny's and Sawyer's interaction at the beginning of
Cats Don't Dance :^)

So where were we?  She punches him out, then gets her
mitten singed by Archy; oh yeah, THESE kids have got off on the
right foot!
     As Knuckles removes the rather prosaic 1.5 volt batteries
from the taser, Julie-Su (the new kid on the block) provides a
brief exposition: seems it was Kragok the Marginally
Pronounceable who activated the self-destruct at the end of the
last miniseries.  She goes on to say that she noticed Knuckles
during her escape and despite wanting to rejoin the Legion "it's
been like someone forcing their will over mine!  I HAD to find you!"  
Archy looks as if he's hearing "Lohengrin" in the background 

RDB note: ???  Another Wagnerian Ring reference?

(and NOT liking the sound of it!), but then the
Chaotix show up and while Vector starts harassing Julie-Su the
others report seismic activity over by the Marble Zone.  This
conversation is being observed by Knuckles' dad, who appears to
be just as pessimistic as Archy about his son's new playmate.
     Fan Art: There's something about Jessalyn Alany's style that
I really like, even if the gesture is weird.  Cristal
Ramanaasras' drawing of Might's hands, OTOH, makes him look
positively arthritic.  And Knuckles get his very own "Do Untold
Damage To Your Eyesight Page."
     Back in Haven, Dad continues to utter dire prophecies about
this latest plot twist while the two young echidnas continue to
bicker.  Yet ANOTHER echidna in Haven (with brown dreads and
wearing a monocle) seems to share the opinion of Knuckles' dad,
whom he addresses as "Locke."  And none too soon; I was REALLY
getting tired of typing "Knuckles' dad" all the time.  Locke also
mentions that he "wasn't prepared...for Lara-Le, either," so
there's another name to keep on file.  After several hours of
inspecting the Zone Knuckles and Julie-Su are on the verge of
going for each other's throats again when the next tremor comes
along.  It causes an apparition to appear; it isn't the Emerald
City, but it's close.  And now "Sir" (Mr. Monocle) AND Archy are
concerned about their "careful planning" going "up in smoke" but
Locke takes a wait-and-see approach as the two echidnas and Archy
head for the city and soon find themselves up to their foreheads
in echidnas.  Seems they've somehow gotten back to Echidnaopolis,
Knuckles' old home town.  Nobody seems to be paying them any
attention, however; well, ALMOST nobody, for Knuckles is
recognized by a female echidna with green eyes and beribboned
dreads who says: "I can't believe that a son wouldn't recognize
his own mother."  Too bad Vector isn't here to witness this
reunion; the situation cries out to have him say to Knuckles:
"Yo' mama!"  At which point Knuckles would have given him a well-
deserved punch in the mouth.  As for Archimedes, he's thinking,
"Oh yeah, THIS day just keeps getting better and better!"
     What kind of son wouldn't recognize his own mother?  How
about one who's spent most of his life living with only his
father, learning how to be something called a Guardian? 
Apparently, the Guardian apprenticeship rules didn't allow for
regular visitations.  Either that, or Locke's custody arrangement
was pretty darn favorable.
     Now is as good a time as any to unwrap a MAJOR SPOILER I've
been carrying around since late March, especially since it's
already been spilled on Ron Bauerle's list.  If you haven't got
the stomach for that sort of thing, skip to the next paragraph. 
It appears Locke's living in Haven isn't just one of the more
dubious perks of being a Guardian.  At the Motor City Comic Con,
Ken Penders told me that one of the things we'll be learning
about Knuckles is that he comes from a broken home.  That's
right: his parents are divorced.  Splitsville.  The Big D.  The
subject of I don't know how many country-western tunes.  Oddly
enough, this pretty much serves the same function as Sonic's race
car bed in "Reality Bytes" [#51]: audience identification.  Ken
said that a lot of the mail that he's gotten indicate that the
readers of the comics (or a notable number thereof) come from
single-parent households -- make of THAT what you will.  

RDB note: they have more time to read comic books?  :^|

Come to think of it, MY folks split back in 1968 when I was in high
school.  Oh, there's LOTS more stuff we'll be learning about
Knuckles, but it can wait.
     As for Mrs. Locke (who may or may not be the "Lara-Le" of whom 
Locke spoke back on page 12), she and Echidnaopolis vanish again.  
The reproachful look on her face as she vanishes communicates 
the message: "You couldn't pick up a phone once in a while?"
     Knuckles confronts Archy with the belief that the little
fire breather knows more than he's telling; Archy's response is
basically a variation on Jack Nicholson's "You can't handle the
truth!" from "A Few Good Men."  Yet ANOTHER quake comes along,
this one serious enough to cause a major rift which would have
spelled doom for Knuckles if Julie-Su hadn't saved his skin by
grabbing his ankle.  So she starts by threatening his life, then
goes on to save it; yep, we'll be going to a wedding at SOME point!  
Great dialogue, BTW:

   JULIE-SU: Is he [Knuckles] always like this?
   ARCHIMEDES: He's actually gotten better!

Think I'll work that into a .sig one of these days.

RDB note: you already did :^)

     The city reappears and the NEXT tremor rolls into the
station and it's deja vu all over again.  They escape from the
quake by running back into the city only to discover everyone
running around in a panic.  One echidna helpfully tells them that
it's Judgment Day.  Knuckles doesn't want to discuss eschatology
and suggests that they look up his mom.  Sure, NOW you think of
your mother!
     However, they first come across a statue of an echidna who
appears to be dressed like Buck Rogers and has a facial
expression that tells me he was full of himself.  This dude is
identified by a plaque: "In Gratitude to our Guardian HAWKING
Creator of the Hyper Zone Projector -- Our Civilization Endures
Because of Him."  

RDB note: hopefully I'll remember this when I send out your review of #5...

While Knuckles theorizes that this has
something to do with the plot, our three friends find themselves
facing what I guess is supposed to be an echidna police squad. 
The leader of the group is wearing a hat that looks like it used
to belong to Ranger Smith in the old Yogi Bear cartoons.  They
appear to belong to something called the EST, and I don't think
it stands for "Echidnaopolis Softball Team".  To be continued.
     Now THIS is more like it!  So far Ken's been successfully
hitting us with some major new characters and plot developments
while managing to keep the story moving.  The characterizations
are perfect.  At first I was put off by the reception Knuckles
gave his mom, but I suppose it would make sense if he'd never
really bonded with her.  He could have looked a little more
shocked throughout, though.  Lara-Le (I GUESS that's the name of
Knuckles' mom) still needs to have her character fleshed out a
bit, but Julie-Su is a revelation: her personality has been
nailed down right out of the box.  I could sense a major chip on
her shoulder from the moment she first flashed those violet eyes
(note to the colorists at Archie Comics: PLEASE don't screw
around with those eyes!).  She's more than some kind of generic
tomboy echidna and WAY more than a Sally knock-off.  Sally
carries herself with a certain maturity that's the result of both
her innate personality and a knowledge of her station in life. 
Julie-Su, OTOH, is positively volcanic -- I got the sense that
she's toting around a LOT more anger than she's showing.  She
doesn't just have an attitude; this has the potential for
expanding into a full-blown case of PASSION!!  
     Still, it's kind of funny: for the longest time, Ken has had
to contend with the fact that Princess Sally was a strong female
character who was more complex than Sonic the Hedgehog (who was
supposed to be the star of his comic).  So what happens when he
moves over to doing Knuckles comics?  He creates ANOTHER strong
female character whose personality threatens to outstrip that of the 
male lead.  On an Irony scale of 1 to 10 that comes pretty darn close 
to an 11.  I am DEFINITELY going to work Julie-Su into my fanfic 
at some point, the character is THAT good!  Hats off to you, Ken.  
     The Letters Page In Search Of A New Name: Contest deadline
is July 31, and I get my copy in the mail on July 29.  The story
of my life.  The thumbnail covers for Sonic #50 and Knuckles #5
simply DON'T do the real things justice.  And thanks to some VERY
substantive Q&A from the fans we learn that:

- The white ring around Knuckles' neck is [a] hereditary trait, as
is the office of Guardian.

- Knuckles WAS prohibited from having contact with outsiders,
thus his meeting with the young Sally (remembered in flashback in
"Black and Blue and Red All Over", Sonic #44) was technically a
violation -- looks like I guessed that one right in my review!

- Menniker "is my great-uncle fifteen generations removed."  Have
I simply gotten paranoid about the hints and clues Ken is
supposed to be dropping in his stories, or does the use of "is"
instead of "was" have some significance?

RDB note: that came up on the genealogy groups recently - should we say 
(the late) John Doe "was" my great-grandfather, or "is"?  There really 
wasn't a consensus either way...

I've received a couple of e-mails lately as much as accusing me
of hating the Sonic and Knuckles comics -- of engaging in
criticizing for criticizing's sake.  I haven't wanted the moon as
far as the quality of Sonic comics is concerned; I only want to
see them approaching THIS level of artistic and narrative
achievement. Is that too much to ask?


Knuckles #5 [Sep 1997]
     Cover art: continued from last issue.  This one actually has
some connection to the story inside.  I could say something about
the dingoes depicted on the front cover but I understand there
are kids lurking nearby.
     Yet ANOTHER great cameo (or whatever) from Spaz/Harvo,
though Julie-Su's boots look a bit overdrawn.  The figures of the
dingo and of Lara-Le are the most impressive due to their being
lit from below, and there's something about Lara-Le's haunted
expression that I find unusually compelling.  

RDB note: the anime eyes might have something to do with it...

     The splash page.  OK, you can look at it one of two ways:
either the drawing (which I think is too nice to be used as
wallpaper) is a contrast of Knuckles As Loner in the foreground
and when he was actually part of a real family in the background;
or else there's a Knuckles sibling that Ken's going to spring on
us at some point.  And if that sib happens to have violet eyes, 
then maybe that music Archy was hearing in the last issue wasn't
"Lohengrin" so much as that banjo music from "Deliverance."  If you 
don't get my meaning, e-mail me; like I said, there ARE children about.

RDB note: I saw "Deliverance" albeit 25+ years ago when I was a kid, 
but I don't remember it dealing with _that_...

     Page 1: I could have done without the Lucas reference; as an
attempt at humor it was too (forgive the pun) Forced.  But I LOVE
the dialogue between Locke and...OK, it isn't "Sir" from the last
issue because he was brown and not red.  All the same, the
dialogue itself is great stuff.  If you tighten it up a little:

     "I know what you're thinking."
     "How?"
     "I know you."
     "Oh."
     "I also know her."
     "What's SHE thinking?"
     "How would I know?"

It reads like great Absurdist drama, along the lines of Samuel
Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" or (more specifically) Tom
Stoppard's "Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."  But let's
get down to business:
     "Lost Paradise: Part 2: Fallout"
     Writer: Ken Penders; Penciler: Manny Galan, Inker: Andrew Pepoy
     Ranger Smith, whose real name is "Constable Remington", has
just busted Knuckles, Archimedes, and Julie-Su.  Still, he
recognized Knuckles as being a Guardian (must've read the Letters
page in the last issue), and uses the old trap door bit to
separate the boys from the girl.  Knuckles and Archy end up in
what looks like someone's apartment, but before we're introduced...
     Remember the appearing and disappearing of Echidnaopolis in
the last issue?  I didn't think that was all that impressive, to
be honest with you.  But the second and third panels on page 6
MORE than make up for it!  We get to see two separate worlds 
(one populated by echidnas, the other by rather military-looking
dingoes) phase-shift across each other's paths.  The inhabitants
of both worlds are freaked out.  One dingo reports this turn of
events to a General Stryker, who's so buff that he reminds me (a
little too much) of Ahnold the Alsatian from Tiny Toons.  He
apparently also has the same barber as Beavis and Butt-head's gym
teacher, Mr. Buzzcut. [Footnote: this is apparently the character
who was originally named "General Von Speer" until Sega put their
corporate foot down and demanded a name change, as also reported
by Ken Penders at the Motor City Comic Con].  Just as well; if
he'd been given a Teutonic name, the temptation to think of him
as sounding like Ahnold would be even greater.
     Back underground, Knuckles is introduced to his host: 
a VERY old Guardian, specifically "your great-grandfather seven
generations removed."  By skipping ahead a few pages we deduce
that this is none other than Hawking!  Only now, as befits his
namesake, he's confined to a wheelchair.  The years (and
apparently there have been a LOT of them!) have not been kind. 
He has Knuckles start playing a set of video discs that show his
exploits during his "tenure as Guardian over 200 years ago."  

RDB note: and without the cheesy grin that his statue from #4 has...

We see him in pursuit of dingoes who have stolen some military
hardware.  We also learn that, according to the Geezer Guardian,
the dingoes have always been warlike and have always stolen
echidna technology, including...
     OK, the LAST time I saw missiles like that was in the
atrocious "Mecha Madness" story.  Mike Gallagher displayed NO
credibility when it came to discussing nuclear weaponry.  Here's
hoping Ken can learn from the past.
     Speaking of the past, Hawking (who is now wearing that
snazzy hat worn by Knuckles in the Sonic _anime_) is shown giving
instructions of some kind WRT the missiles to yet ANOTHER Guardian, 
this one wearing a dreadlock ring with the letter "M" on it.  
It's yet another tease as we follow Hawking into one of the 
underground tech storage vaults to fetch "perhaps the only possible 
solution" to their crisis: a remote control unit for an RC car?
     Ad on the facing page for: the ill-fated "Endgame" series,
including #50 which they insist on calling a "commemorative
issue."  Technically, something "commemorative" serves as a
reminder of someone or something, or else honors someone's death. 
The use of the word might have made sense if Sally really DID
kick it in the course of the story arc; as it stands, and given
the use of a certain character's silhouette in the "Endgame"
logo, it appears that the issue is intended to be a tribute to
Dr. Robotnik.  Any hope on my part that we'll ever see the
"director's cut" of #50 has pretty much dimmed; I just want to
forget that that whole sorry arc ever happened!
     Fan Art: Joshua Bails of "Waren", Michigan (wonder if that's
anywhere near "Warren", Michigan?) draws a "Knuckles" attacking...
either it's a pirate or somebody's maiden aunt.  And the Small 
Names In No Particular Order Page: note to the parents of 
"Joel  A Punch Is Worth A Thousand Words' Blackwood": get therapy.
     Back to the flashback as Hawking uses the remote control to
activate some kind of countermeasure against the incoming
missiles.  The sequence is given supposed weight by Hawking's
narration: "I was breaking the most solemn vow a Guardian swears
before all else!  For the first time I wondered which mattered
more--my people--or my conscience!"  Gee, if I'm looking at the
prospect of my fellow echidnas being turned into extra crispy
nuggets because one of my ancestors had a problem with
technology, and if I DON'T use that technology a huge chunk of
the population I'm supposed to be guarding is going to buy the
harp farm, I'd call that decision a no-brainer!
     Basically, what Hawking did was something that any first
year cadet at Starfleet Academy would have done: "Raise shields!" 
The "energy shields" managed to save Echidnaopolis but of course
the rest of the island was in jeopardy from the radioactive
debris.  So, having bought some time and after going through
Dimitri/Enerjak's papers (which apparently included a copy of
Sonic #50), Hawking came up with the Hyper Zone Projector which
transported Echidnaopolis to another zone.  Three hours,
seventeen minutes, forty-two seconds into the future, perhaps. 
The Dingo Empire (or whatever they called it) was similarly
treated but sent to a different time zone.
     This doesn't tie everything up in a neat package -- at that
age, I guess Hawking is suffering from an advanced case of loose
continuity.  He then shows Knuckles a statue of the Floating
Island as supported by Edmund and another echidna whose name is
"conveniently" out of the frame.  Hawking tells Knuckles that it
symbolizes both his heritage and responsibility.  Knuckles has
"more questions than ever before", and he ain't the only one. 
But in the true spirit of dysfunctional families, Hawking tells
Knuckles to "shut up and listen."
     At least he TRIES to, until a timely tremor cuts him off in
mid-sentence.  It's Julie-Su, ready to blow her top because she
hasn't put in an appearance since page 4.  Constable Remington
decides that because she was keeping company with Knuckles at the
time they were arrested she is automatically a "representative"
of the Guardian and therefore qualified to handle a hostage
crisis.  That strikes me as a little like saying that by virtue
of genetics my twin brother and I are qualified to switch jobs,
but at least it keeps her involved in the plot.  Somehow,
Remington's lumping the dingoes in with what he tells Julie-Su
are "your kind" really makes me question his judgment.
     Anyway, cut back to Knuckles who watches Hawking levitate himself 
back into his wheelchair.  OK, so maybe "confined" isn't the best word.
Anyway, Knuckles and Archy now see that dingoes are holding his mom, 
Lara-Le, hostage.  Also involved, according to Remington, is 
"her consort."  Lighten up, Remington, you can say "boyfriend."  
Knuckles, I'm sure, could come up with an alternative label.
     OK, I can be pretty slow on the uptake sometimes -- hey,
I AM 45 years old! -- but it's beginning to look to me as if
"Guardian" can also be pronounced "Superhero."  In the discs we
see Hawking flying through the air, wearing Captain Marvel
gloves, and only now is it all beginning to fall into place: the
powers, the solitude, Hawking's longevity, the deference shown by
Remington.  I'm beginning to see where this is going and,
frankly, I've got mixed emotions about it.
     Earlier in the story Knuckles had described himself as "just
an ordinary Joe doing his job" and that was pretty much the way
I'd thought of him as well.  I'd thought nothing unusual about
Knuckles' flying/gliding/whatever.  Then again, I'd thought
nothing unusual about Sonic's speed or Tails' ability to fly. 
Seemed to make sense in the context of Mobius.  That's one of the
reasons I disliked "Bedtime Tails" (Sonic #38); it seemed as if
Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders were tinkering with a crossover
between a furry book and a muscle-and-spandex book without either
trying for a full-blown parody of the superhero genre or treating
the characters as if they actually WERE superheroes.  And given
the rather depressing crop of superheroes nowadays (Spawn, the
Maxx), the genre NEEDS to take itself less seriously!
     Unfortunately, muscle-and-spandex are the coin of the realm for 
comic books, and it looks like the Knuckles story is going to be no 
exception.  Poor Knuckles isn't about to get buff (we now have 
Gen. Stryker for that), and I hope he doesn't decide to go with 
a dorkey costume.  Unfortunately, he's showing some of the same 
dysfunctional characteristics as the Dark Knight model of Batman.
     Let's see what we have so far: he's been raised in
isolation, apart from anything resembling a family, so it's no
wonder he didn't exactly relate well to his own mother in the
last issue -- he probably never really bonded with her, and after
spending so much time with just his dad (who is, in effect, in
hiding from his own son) his social skills are shot.  It also
probably goes a long way toward explaining why Locke's marriage
to Lara-Le went sour.  Since the hidden figure on page 1
professed not to understand "Jenna" or Lara-Le (whom he claims to
know nevertheless), I get the sense that perhaps MOST Guardians
who grew up in this system had such poor social skills that
troubled relationships were the rule rather than the exception. 
And in claiming to "know" and "not understand" at the same time,
it's an indication of just how blind to the problem the Guardians
are!  In addition, Knuckles has also inherited a rigid code of
behavior that is NOT to be questioned; it almost prevented him
from striking up a friendship with Princess Sally in "Black And
Blue And Red All Over" (Sonic #44).  He's only gradually getting
to know his relatives whose one common denominator seems to be a
well-developed knack for keeping secrets from each other and
especially from Knuckles.  Even the dialogues between Guardians
other than Knuckles (Locke and "Sir", for instance) leave too
much unsaid and convey a sense that these are NOT happy campers;
Ken has yet to portray ONE Guardian who demonstrates anything
resembling peace of mind.  Any way you slice it, this whole
Guardian system leaves a lot to be desired psychologically.
Maybe it's my middle-age disillusionment with the IDEA of
superheroism coming through.  Still, I'm beginning to understand
why the office of Guardian is hereditary: no echidna in his/her
right mind would WANT the job.  In the words of John Lennon,
"I wouldn't do it for a giggle."
     Postcards For The Time Being Until We Pick A New Name:
Knuckles #6, Sonic #51, and a VERY NICE film noir cover of Sonic #52.  
The INSIDES should only be so impressive.  And letters: leave it to 
a Californian to ask Knuckles if he has "a sensitive side"; the 
rather telling reply, "I'd like to think so but I'd never admit it."  
Let's see: psychologists recognize that dysfunctional families tend 
to live by three hard and fast rules: Don't Talk; Don't Trust; Don't Feel.  
Knuckles has grown up apart from the society of which he's supposed to be 
a Guardian; the Guardians who are supposed to be initiating him into the
office seem to have an attitude best summed up by Hawking's "Shut up and 
listen" so it seems that they don't even trust the kid; and he's not 
even honest about his own feelings.  John Bradshaw, call your office.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the "Cliff's Notes"
description:

Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: "Eight years
passed."  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
"Uncle Chuck" and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
encounters "a cute little chipmunk girl": Princess Sally Acorn. 
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the "Ro-Bo-Machine."  Ch. 7:
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
them to "Knothole Village" which is "under the forest floor."
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.



_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
a plan (via Snively) to capture "one of the weaker freedom
fighters" to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
gang comes up with a "Trojan Robotnik" ploy to get inside. 
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
Rabbot.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic & Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
take out the bots and "haul some serious haunch" back to
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
question was one of "brave and true warriors" compiled by Sally's
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
fragment:
               ...beside your bed safe and...
               ...tucked in tight...
               ...you cannot fall...
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of "clues" is
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
"bot" were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
its "prisoners" arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
and the Freedom Fighters escape.


_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the "Game Guy" episode
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.
