This file is a thread capture about how Tails got two tails, taken from the
newsgroup rec.arts.animatiion.  Having done this capture from two sites 
(USIT and Delphi), there is a chance I missed a message or captured one 
twice; nevertheless, most if not all the thread is here.  This thread was 
active prior to the advent of the way past cool Sonic mailing list.

Nine tails. Nine tailed foxes tend to be shapeshifting, evil spirits
that wreak considerable mischief on humans.

Maybe the same way Charles/Mambo on "Duckman" ended up with two heads?

Seriously, it looks like the character design from the video game was
simply lateraled over to animation.  But it's not an idle question.  If
I might be allowed to pontificate:

[Lecture hall mode on]:

It was established this past season that Tails is 10 years old in the Sat
AM series.  Since it was also established that a) Mobius was taken over
by Robotnik when Sonic and Sally were only 5, and b) Sally won't reach
the age of majority (18) for two more years [making her a sweet 16],
therefore Mobius has been under Robotnik's thumb for the past 11 years,
just slightly longer than Tails' entire lifetime.  This leaves open the
possibility that Tails might be a mutant, as there don't seem to be any
other two-tailed foxes about.  

I don't know whether this has been covered in the comics, but the
question of Tails' origin could go one of several ways:

   1) His condition could have been caused by Robotnik's poisoning of
   the city.  As a result, he might have been exposed/abandoned as an
   infant.  Someone from Knothole would then have taken him in and he
   grew up bonding with Sonic as sort of an older sib.

   2) Leaving Robotnik out of the picture, his condition could just have
   been a naturally-occurring abnormality.  Abandoned in infancy, etc.
   etc.

Makes for a couple good potential stories, in any event.

[Lecture hall mode off]

Of course, if this ground was already covered in the comics, I will
defer to the "received text."  Let me ask someone who subscribed to the
comics and I'll get back to r.a.a.

I think that was one of many "explainations" sent in by readers (at the
company's request).  They printed a full page of them.          

On a related note, the word balloon in this panel of an imaginary scene
speaks for itself:

However, if you look on the box the Tails plushie comes in, you'll see 
that Tails himself says "I'm almost five years old...."

As someone else pointed out, it comes directly from the video game (well, not
quite. They based the comic book on the video game, changing a few things. Then
ABC based it's cartoon on the comic book changing a few things of their own. Now
the comic book is starting to base their storylines on the cartoon and it comes
full circle)
So the question arises, why does Tails have two tails in the video game? Simple
Reason: The programmers wanted him to be able to fly. In the game, Tails isn't
as fast as Sonic, and frequently lags behind if Sonic hits a straightaway. The
programmers needed to explain why Tails could catch up and came up with flight
as an answer. This also makes it easy to bring Tails back if he "dies" as he
just flies back in. So why didn't the programmers choose a bird to be the side
kick? Thats where the Japanese Mythology comes in. Sonic is originaly a Japanese
game and I guess that the programmers just wanted a Kitsune (Multi-tailed Fox)
in their game.

Of course, as far as I know, they haven't said a concrete reason on the show 
(disclaimer: I've only seen a few of the second season shows. I KNOW that it
wasn't mentioned in the first season.) and so they could come up with any reason
they want to. I like the mutation theory.
Of course, we all know the real reason that Tails has two tails...It makes him
so damn cute.

Prehaps. But Tails is a fox. :)

(Belive it or not, it seems more likely that short tailed squirrels are natural to Mobius. Acording to the Comic Book, Sally is a ground squirrel.)

It's in comic issue No. 16 (Nov.).  There are no page numbers, but that 
answer appears on the second page of "Sonicgrams" about two-fifths of the 
way down the first column, and "Sonicgrams" in that issue is at the back 
of the comic.

Don't be silly. Tails is NOT a squirrel. He's a fox. A Kitsune to be
exact. Japanese fox spirits are multi-tailed, ranging from just a couple
up to 7 (max) and the more tails they have, the higher rank they have.
I personally advise finding a book of Japanese mythology, where you will
find out the rest of the interesting things about Kitsune. I certainly
won't go into it all here.

So her father is a fox.  Does that means she is necessarily one?  What
if her mother was some other species?  :)

Or perhaps foxes in this world have anywhere from 0-2 tails?

This is VERY sad.  I can't believe all of these inconsistencies that have
occurred between the comic and the series!!!

As far as the show goes, both Tails and  Sally are a foxes. (as is her father) 
 
Unfortunately, the comic artists/writers don't pay any attention to the
show, and vice versa.  This creates a long series of posts which basically
say there IS NO common ground between the comic and weekly series.
I have no buisness commenting on the comic (since I've never seen it)
but I do like the new season's episodes and hope that the story line continues
as strong as it has so far.  The show this season runs just like a soap
opera with one show relying on the last for plot points (if you missed some
episodes you could get very lost as to what is happening)

Oh well, this is the price we pay for poor communication...

No, 9 is the ultimate number. In fact, there was an animated feature
film about this in the sixties - "The Fox With Nine Tails" (Japan 1968)
- in which the title character is a sort of anti-Christ.

The nine-tailed fox is an old part of Japanese lore.

Oh, well thank God for eppisodes like the one that aired yesterday (1/14) that
have no ties to any of the other eppisodes, are broken up into two fifteen
minute stories, so we don't have to try to follow even a half-hour plot, and 
require almost no brain power to watch. :)  (Sniff, sniff. Do you smell that?
that's sarcasm.) This writing this season seems a little inconsistent. Sure
they'll have continuing plot lines that build a continuing story, but then
they'll turn around and make an eppisode broken down into two fifteen minute 
shorts, which seem to be targeted at a much younger audience than the rest of
the show. (IMHO, it doesn't help that Antoine is usually a central character in
the shorts, but that is a purely personal gripe on my part.) Due to problems
with tv reception, I missed much of the first part of this season. Just my luck,
I ended up seeing mostly the shorts eppisodes. I was affraid that this show was
going the direction of _The_Adventures_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_ (syndicated). As
for communications problems between the comic people and the show people, they
are starting to resolve some of that. The comic finally changed Sally's coloring
to match the show (and even added the vest from this season). The plotlines of
the comic are also slowly approaching the quality of the show.
As for Sally being a fox, have they ever specifically mentioned it on the show?
I know they didn't in the first season.

missed so much of this season.) I know you can't go by the fact that Tails calls
Sally "Aunt Sally" because he calls Bunnie "Aunt Bunnie." (Unless you want to
throw in even more crossbreeding, Fuzzy. :)

This last point is too good to let slide.  I've been cobbling together a
Sonic story in my spare time, and one of the things I realized
was probably never explicitly stated in either the toons or the
comix.  It seems (to me, at any rate) natural for Tails to address the
female characters as "Aunt...."  Just as Sally and Bunnie refer to Sir
Charles as "Uncle Chuck", though technically he's only uncle to Sonic.

You have to remember that the Knothole gang have all had their families
disrupted: seeing their real relatives coming out of the wrong end of
the roboticizer.  So it would be only natural for them to cobble
together a relationship that resembles a loose family more than a
resistance organization.  As I have Bunnie put it: "We all lost our real
kin, so we have to be kin to each other.  It helps keep us going."

Exactly. By most calculations, Tails was born after Robotnic's take-over. The 
poor kid probably never had anything that even resembles a natural family life.
Actually, that would make a good story: What happend to Tails' parents?

Just makes it harder to determine the species of some of the more ambiguious
characters. Some are easy, but others, like Sally, are rather hard. During the
first season I had used the "Aunt Sally" phrase to prove that she's a fox (with
a very short tail, but still) Then the comic book comes along, saying she's a
ground squirel (there's still a tail problem with that) and then I hear Tails 
use the phrase "Aunt Bunnie" and my argument about what species Sally is
vanishes in a puff of logic. <Sigh>

I was thinking along the same lines. Especially this season, a continuity manual
would almost be manditory. As for the comix writers comunicating with the show
writers, I doubt it.

Back on: :^)

Well, Babs Bunny often has them too :^)  And I liked the green eyes of
the girl mouse (darn, forgot her name) from "Once Upon a Forest".  Hmm,
come to think about it, that's probably what's so attractive about toon
furries: their large expressive eyes...

Anyway, my main reason for this follow-up: if only the comic book would
stop drawing Sally's nose with that dash of blue in it.  Yes, I know
about the blue-to-better-highlight-black deal in comic books (e.g.,
hair), but it's not necessary here - all she needs is a white spot to
denote reflectivity (as done in the ads in the comic for the Princess
Sally miniseries comic).

"What happened to Tails' parents?"  I can't shake the
feeling that there's a really touching scene here we'll
never see.  Y'know, set it up with his parents scolding him
about always running around with that daredevil hedgehog,
how he'll get in trouble or hurt or worse, so he sneaks
out without their knowing.  While he and Sonic are out
adventuring, Swatbots march in and torch the place.
Hours later, Sonic and Miles (can't stand that silly
nickname!) head home...Sonic, of course, gets there first,
sees the devastation, makes a good guess as to the fate of
the kid's family, and tries to keep him from seeing it.
("Whoa, better not go in there, big guy..." ) Followed
by Miles reacting in shock and horror and Sonic resolving
to look after him from now on.  ("It's not safe here.
We'd better go." "Where? *snif* Where can we go now?
Nowhere's safe." "No sweat, you'll be safe with me.")
    --I've always had the feeling that they were together
some time before the founding of Knothole, and that for
awhile Sonic was the only family and support Miles had.
But it's no surprise to me that everyone in Knothole seems
to regard the kid as an adopted baby brother and all-around
favorite.  (Given a chance, I'd do the same! =O) --POK

Myself, I've always nursed the idea that a younger Sonic, while on a
surreptitious trip to Robotropolis, witnesses Tails' parents abandoning
him as an infant, just before their own capture.  Sonic brings the
foundling back to Knothole to raise -- remember, Rosie is supposed to be
there to supervise the zoo.  Parallel to that would be a Dumbo-type
story of Tails' discovering what two tails are good for.

BTW, when did the name change from Miles Perour ( X-P ) to Tails?  I'm
compiling my own Sonic FAQ and this'll probably come up again.

1. It's Miles Prower, not perour.
2. It was at the same time that he was introduced, in the video game Sonic 2.
"Tails" was given as his nickname.

The series people used the comic as a launching point. There was no
continuity to speak of.

Where do the comic people get their instructions? I asked that question
and they told me SEGA! Sally's vest? Sega wanted it.

The thing to remember is that not all chipmunks and squirrels have long
fluffy tails.

Also, note that the central characters aren't those you'd find in a U.S.
park. Hedgehogs and pangolins aren't Ameri-centric species. Sega
was looking for the different angle. Bunny and the rest were cobbled up
by the American comic people. As a result we are looking at a
hodge-podge and trying to extract some logic from it. It wasn't born of
logic so people are beating their heads against a brick wall.

Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Urp. You are right, and I screwed up.  I think I will have that foot with
thousand island dressing, thanks. 

What's worse, I KNEW that. And I still screwed it up.

There is no authoritive answer as to Sally's species!  However...
I believe she is a vixen for 3 reasons:
1)her father is a fox.
    As Fuzzy Fox mentioned, there could be some X-breeding involved with her mother,
    but that sort of thing usually doesn't happen in Royalty. (purity of the family line)
    (I believe this story is taking place in a future Earth, but I won't discuss that here)
2)Her short tail could be explained by her age...In "Drood Henge" Sally is 16, and the 
    show made a big deal that she has not "come of age" (turned 18).  Therefore, she just
    might not be full grown    
3)if you were going to create a sexy girl for Sonic, what better species than a fox(vixen)?
    ;)

...I love this show...

Myself, I've always nursed the idea that a younger Sonic, while on a
surreptitious trip to Robotropolis, witnesses Tails' parents abandoning
him as an infant, just before their own capture.  Sonic brings the
foundling back to Knothole to raise -- remember, Rosie is supposed to be
there to supervise the zoo.  Parallel to that would be a Dumbo-type
story of Tails' discovering what two tails are good for.

BTW, when did the name change from Miles Perour ( X-P ) to Tails?  I'm
compiling my own Sonic FAQ and this'll probably come up again.
