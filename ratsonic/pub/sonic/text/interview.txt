Subject: interview with Yuji Naka

I dont know if any one cares but I came across an Interview with Yuji Naka
(creater of sonic/robotnik) .  Note this interview took place just before the
relase of sonic 2.

Interview with Yuji Naka: the creator of sonic the Hedgehog

     We recently had the opportunity to vist with Yuji Naka, the creator of
Sonic the Hedgehog, at the SEGA Technical Institute in Palo Alto,
Calfifornia.  Naka and the original Sonic team are currently working on sonic
the hedgehog 2, the exciting sequel planned for relase later this year.
     The combination of Japanese programmers and artists with local resources
make the development of sonic 2 a truly exciting American-Japanese joint
effort.


SEGA VISSONS:  We understand youre busy working on sonic the hedgehog 2.
 What can you can you tell us about it?

NAKA: For one thing, sonic 2 is twice as long as sonic 1.  For another, sonic
has to run through more levels...many more then sonic 1.  Also, the new
Mobius worlds are brighter, crisper, and much more detailed.  However, we
think players will be too busy getting through the game to spend any time
enjoying the scenery.  Especially since sonic will have a new friend.

SV: A new friend?

NAKA: A fox with two tails.  We call him tails naturally.  He helps sonic out
of tight spots, and can help sonic defeat enemies.

SV: How many people are working on sonic 2?  How does this compare with the
oreiginal sonic 1?

NAKA: A total of 12 people are working on sonic 2.  Thats 30% more then
worked on the original game.  Its basically the same team as the original,
with another programer and more designers and artists.  The original team had
3 artists, 2 game designers and 3 sound and music guys.

SV: Who is writting the music?

NAKA: The bass player for the famous Japanese band called Dream Come True
wrote the original music for the game.  The other 2 guys worked on the sound
effects and on converting to a video game format.  The same guys are working
on the music for sonic 2.

SV: What were some of the things you thought about when you first created the
sonic character?

NAKA: At first we used a character that looked like a rabbit with ears that
could extend and pick up objects.  As the game got faster and faster, we
needed to come up with a special characteristic to give our character some
power over his enemies.  I rembered a character I had thought about years ago
who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies.  Hedgehogs can roll
themselfs into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.

SV: How about the name sonic?

NAKA: Because our new character could move really fast on the screen we were
looking for a name that suggested speed.  One of the designers said
supersonic and the sonic part stuck.

SV: Where did the other characters in the game come from?

NAKA: We wanted one of the characters in the game to be eggshaped, so we
created Robotnik.  It was a great character, but since it couldnt be the main
character, we made him the bad guy.

SV: What were some of your other games?

NAKA: Ghouls & Ghosts, Phantasy Star I and II and Super Thunder Bolt for the
Genesis.  For the Master System I did Phanstsy Star I, Space Harrier, Outrun,
Blackbelt, Spy Vs Spy, F16 Fighting Falcon, and Great Baseball.

SV: How and when did you get started creating video games?

NAKA: I joined SEGA in 1984, after I finished school.

SV: Were you programming games in school?

NAKA: I had a part time job  programming games while I was in school.  I
worked on Fujitsu and Sharp computers.  I joined Sega in Japan and then came
to America last year.

SV: What is your ongoing philosophy about creating video games?

NAKA: I want to make interesting games.  I want to show my dreams and visions
to kids.  But most important, I want to create something that will make the
player happy.  I want the player to be surprised and have fun.

SV: Do you have any advice for people who want to creat video games?

NAKA: Yes.  Play lots of games.  Not just play them to win, but think about
them critically and analyze their strengths and weaknesses, constantly
looking for ways to improve them.  They should also draw on their own
experciences for insperation.  Everything I do in my daily life, I think
about how it would fit into a game.


     During our vist to the SEGA Technical Instittute, we confirmed what we
had suspected all along--sonic 2 is going to be the hottest title of the
year.  Period.  Heres why:
     Sonic 2 is bigger, faster, more challenging, and more fun then the
original.  It has more levels, with a secret zone that you'll have to work
hard to find, a new bonus rounds that youll have to get through to get the
Chaos Emeralds.
     Sonic 2 will be coming out on Genesis, Game Gear, and Seag CD.  The
increased capacity of the Sega CD version will allow addational zones, as
well as special bonus rounds between zones.  In these bonus rounds, sonic
takes you on a first person roller coster ride, a half pipe maze complete
with enemies, traps and dead ends.  You control sonic as he tries to get
through the maze, and you go with him as he takes on those 360 degree loops
and 90 degree turns.
     And thats just between the zones.  All versions of sonic 2 will have new
zones, with new tricks, new enemies, and new challenges.  Wait till you try
the new Green Hill Zone, or the new Metropolis Zone, or the Chemical Factory.
 Or Death Egg, where you get to visit Robotniks ship.

The Hill Top Zone will take sonic to new heights.

The Chemical Factory Zone is the acid test of sonics prowess.

The New Green Hill Zone is even bigger and more challenging then the
original.

The Green Hill Zone has sonic and his friend running through corkscrews and
other strange structures.



Well hope you enjoyed.

Kiken here, well, Naka Yuji-san (or "YU2" as he likes to be called) did 
create Sonic, but he didn't create Eggman.  I believe that Ohshima 
Naoto-san (or "Big Island" as he likes to go by) created Eggman.

Jeez, talk about the "long and short" of it.  There were over 200 
original illustrations by the programmers and artists at Sega Enterprises 
(Japan).  After about one month, they managed to narrow the selection 
down to four individual characters:

A wolf wearing a stars and stripes t-shirt (he looked very Sonic-esque)
A bullbog wearing a "cowboy" outfit
A roundish, egg-shaped human wearing loud hawaiian style clothes and 
   carrying an airboard
And well, guess!

Its kinda obvious who made it in the final decision, but its interesting 
to see how Eggman was originally intended to be the hero.  I still think 
that would have been odd, running around the screen with some large, round 
guy.

Oh, that secret zone.  Formerly called "Hidden Palace".  Damn, they hid 
it so well it wasn't even in the final program.
