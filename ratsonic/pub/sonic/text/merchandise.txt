SONIC THE HEDGEHOG MERCHANDISE LIST v5.0.0a (28 November 1996)
Compiled by Erich Schulman (KTN4CA)

This is the plain ASCII version of the Sonic Merchandise List.  A hypertext
version can be viewed on the World Wide Web (WWW) at
http://rat.org/sonic/merchandise.html.  Although the WWW version contains
some information not in this plain text version, all products appear in both 
versions.

THE MERCHANDISE LIST IS *NOT* A "FOR SALE" LIST, PRICE LIST, OR CATALOG!
The list maintainer is not a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer, so
please do not send product orders to the list maintainer.

See the "Retailers" section for suggestions on obtaining products.

The Sonic Merchandise List contains all the products the list maintainer
knows about or has been told about.  It does not list all Sonic-related
products in existence.  Existence or availability of any listed product
is not guaranteed.  A product's inclusion in the list is not an endorese-
ment for said product by either the list maintainer or the maintainer's
network service providers.  A product's exclusion from the list is merely
because the list maintainer does not know about said product, and such
exclusion is not a negative endorsement or disrecommendation.  The list
maintainer does not guarantee all products have been properly licensed
by SEGA of America, or by SEGA's subsidiaries and affiliates.

Send submissions and corrections to sonic@rat.org.

Most information on Sega products was cut and pasted from a session log on
CompuServe.  Some information was cut and pasted from Sonic mailing list
postings, Usenet postings, and personal e-mail.
