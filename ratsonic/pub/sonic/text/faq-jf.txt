as.  Its a start but could use a bit of feedback and input from the 
television series.

4 Trans-Sonic: For passing fancy!.
5 Hyper-Sonic: Up to twice the speed of sound... don't 'mach' me out!
6 Warp-Sonic:  Lite speed - 1/3 faster than your regular bulb!

(7) Sonic Spin dash!

Robotnic's Rules (From Sonic #3)
1 No Reading
2 No Laughing
3 No Live Plants
4 ... (I don't have issue #3.. can someone help me?)


>>Questions and Answers!

Q:  What speed setting does Sonic have to go for his legs to turn into 
    those swirly things?

A:  Trans-Sonic


Q:  What color is Sally's hair?

A:  Good question!  
    In Sonic Miniseries 0 it was blond with red fur.
    In Sonic Miniseries 1-3 and Sonic 1-15 she's a brunette with pink fur.
    Sonic 16 and after she's a red-head with brown fur, just like on TV.  
    (They explained the color changes in SonicGrams #16; Archie writers had 
    little material to base her on until the TV series came out)

    In a side note:  The comic book tends to follow both the Saturday and
    Weekday television series but follows the Saturday series more closely.


Q:  What species is Sally?

A:  Squirrel! (Given in SonicGrams #5, #14, #16 and #17)
    (Ground squirrel according to SonicGrams #19)


Q:  What species is Antoine?

A:  Fox (Given in SonicGrams #12)


Q:  Sonic's Favorite Food?

A:  Chili Dogs!  "My favorite food gives me alot of.. 'Jet Propultion'"
    (Yup.. thats what Sonic said in SonicGrams #12 .. eeeww)


Q:  How did Tails get his 2nd tail?

A:  Reader mail in Sonic #2 gives a few possibilities:
      (1) Tails is a mutant!
      (2) Tails was created in Dr. Frankenstein's Lab
      (3) Tails has Antoine's tail!
    [(3) is my favorite]
    A reply in SonicGrams #9 states he was born that way.
    A reply in SonicGrams #16 states Antoine gave his tail to Tails so he
    could fly.  Hrm.. I guess (3) is Sonic's favorite answer too!
    
    Added comment:  (1) is the most plausable in my opinion.  With 
    Robotnik polluting everything you're bound to find some mutants.

Q:  How did Bunnie Rabbot get her robot arm and legs?

A:  Sonic saved Bunnie from being Roboticized but not before she gained 
    some robotic parts. (Given in SonicGrams #16)


Q:  Why is Miles Prower called Tails?

A:  Its a nickname.  He prefers Tails over Miles (wouldn't you?)


Q:  How old is Sonic?

A:  Back in SonicGrams #7 Sonic didn't want to reveal his age, but he 
    eventually said he was 15 (SonicGrams #16 and #18)


Q:  How old is Sally?

A:  Also 15 (SonicGrams IYF#1 and #20)


Q:  How old is Tails?

A:  Somewhere I heard he was 4 (perhaps a Sega Vision's magazine.. I 
    couldn't find it in SonicGrams) but a recent TV episode said he's 10.
    This seems a bit more plausable given Tail's personality.


Q:  Where is Mobius?
 
A:  SonicGrams #9 says the planet is in an unspecified point in space.
    (Cop-out answer)


Q:  Who was the king of Mobius?

A:  Sonic #10 shows a picture of the king.  He looks alot like an old male
    version of Sally.  This contradicts the TV series where he looked alot
    like a fox.  Sonic #17 first shows the king as he appears on TV as a
    fox (in Princess Sally's Crusade).

    Added note:  Very strange to be a squirrel princess while having a 
    fox king.  Perhaps Sally is an adopted daughter (or a daughter by
    marriage)


>>Which comic issues did we see the cast memberst?

Friend or foe??

  #20, SAL#1 Gefforey St. John (I certainly smell a foe here though)

*   Boomer was renamed Rotor to match the TV series in issue 6 (in a 
    Dicken's parody).  The issue was hammered home issue 9.
**  A poster had Bunnie in MS1 but she was not in any storylines until ???.
*** Snively first appears in #6 in a Dicken's Christmas Carol parody but
    was called 'Jacob Snarley'

Feel free to make additions and corrections.  Remember this is based 
almost entirely on the Archie comic series.

Also.. Anyone know where I can get Sonic Miniseries issue #3?  I can 
back-order the others which I don't have.
