There was a Sonic robot in issue #9 of the Sonic comic from Archie. I
couldn't get this issue, so I don't know any details.

The Metal Sonic from the 'Sonic CD' game had an appearance in the Sonic
comic from Fleetway Publications, issue #21 - #23, 'The Sonic Terminator'
(last three parts of a six-part story).

Basically, the story has a lot of the CD game in it.

[snip]

Issue #21:
Sonic receives a distress signal sent by Amy (a pink lady hedgehog) from
Never Lake. When Sonic gets there he finds the Little Planet completely
covered with Robotniks factories and chained to Mobius with a gigantic
chain. While saving Amy he is attacked by Metal Sonic but is able to defeat
him. Just when things seem to be back to normal and Sonic does his usual
jokes (Sonic: "Did I ever tell you that pink is my most _non-favourite_
color?" Amy: "Oh Sonic, you say the cutest things!") Metal Sonic gets up
again and hits Sonic from behind. Because its systems are severly damaged,
Metal Sonic takes Amy to the Little Planet as 'life bait' for Sonic. Sonic
follows them over the chain that holds the Little Planet.

Issue #22:
Sonic finds Amy and tries to defeat Metal Sonic, but his enemy is itself
a part of the technology that covers the Little Planet. So it can drain
energy from the surrounding machinery to repair itself. Just as Metal
Sonic is about to finish Sonic, it gets hit by another Sonic who is only
half the size of the original. He then pushes Sonic into a shrinking ray
and hands him a Time Stone.

Issue #23:
With the Time Stone Sonic travels back into the past and finds the machine
that caused the changes on the Little Planet. Because of his small size
he is able to enter the machine and destroy it from within. He travels
back to the present just in time to prevent Metal Sonic from doing the  
kill. He hands over the Time Stone to his other self and sends him back  
into time. Due to the changes in the past the Little Planet is returned to
normal. The Metal Sonic disappears too, because he was created by the same
machinery.

Another example for my bad grammar... oh well. Hope you can find out
what was meant.

Well, I don't know the story in issue #9 of the American Sonic comic,
but thinking of all the sh*t I've seen from Archie so far with all the
slapstick and uninspired drawing styles, I assume that the English
version is a little more interesting. (Too bad you haven't seen the
'Enter Knuckles' story from Fleetway. Definitely _way_ better than the
Archie comics version 'This Island Hedgehog'.)

Only my opinion... don't flame me, I'm nobody's toast.

First of all, I made a small error in this last post. The Metal Sonic  
appeared in issue #26 - #28 and the complete story has only five parts.

The first two parts tell how Captain Plunder and the Mystic Cave Pirates  
try to steal the Chaos Emeralds from Sonic.

> Thanks for the info!  I really appreciate it.  [We want information...]

Well, in general the comic has a lot of everything, even solo stories with  
Tails or Knuckles as the leading character or stories about Ecco The  
Dolphin, Shinobi, Eternal Champions, Wonderboy etc.

Oh my... I'll try my best:

The 'Enter Knuckles' story is in issue #33 - #34 with leads into
the 'Power Of The Chaos Emeralds' story in issue #35 - #36.

[snip]

Issue #33:
Dr. Robotnik has crash-landed with his space satellite Death Egg II on the  
Floating Island. Sonic & Tails fly to the island to search for him and  
finish him once and for all. After destroying some traps and battling some  
Badniks they meet Robotnik, who has already convinced Knuckles that Sonic  
is the bad guy who wants to steal the Floating Island Chaos Emeralds.

Issue #34:
Sonic & Knuckles have an excessive fight using everything they can offer   
(Sonic running in circles around Knuckles, Knuckles digging underground  
etc.). The fight ends to be a tie, but Tails is able to capture Robotnik
by throwing a net over him. Sonic & Tails escape with the captured  
Robotnik.

Issue #35:
Back at Sonics secret base, Porker Lewis tries to interrogate Robotnik.  
Suddenly Knuckles breaks into the cell to free the doctor. In this moment  
of confusion Robotnik takes Porker Lewis hostage and demands the Chaos  
Emeralds from Sonic. Sonic & Tails try to retrieve the stolen Chaos  
Emeralds from Robotnik and force him to crash land on the Floating Island.

Issue #36:
Again Sonic & Knuckles have a fight. Sonic pretends to be beaten but  
follows Knuckles and Robotnik secretly. Robotnik re-integrates the six  
Chaos Emeralds with the six on the Floating Island (that were once split  
into twelve). Sonic arrives just in time to see Robotnik absorbing the  
chaos energy to become invincible. Knuckles realizes that Robotnik lied to  
him and uses the Master Emerald which he kept hidden to regain control  
over the other emeralds. Robotnik is sent back to Mobius after his new  
powers have been removed. Sonic & Tails leave, Knuckles stays on the  
Floating Island to guard the emeralds.

Why don't you order some issues yourself? They are definitely worth the  
money! Stories in a comic book should be read, not summarized. ,-)
