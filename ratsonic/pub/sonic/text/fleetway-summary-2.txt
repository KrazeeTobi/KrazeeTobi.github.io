Hi there fellow Sonic fans.

The English Sonic comic (published by Fleetway) has reached issue #59.   
Therefore I thought it would be nice to send you a checklist of all the  
stories that have been published in this comic so far...

Most of the stories are split up over several issues.  If a story has  
subtitles, then they are listed before the issue numbers.

For those who already got photocopies of some of the Sonic stories from  
me, here is a list of the more important events in the Fleetway storyline:

- Issue #8 - #10
  Sonic's origin (along with the beginning of a totally new storyline)

- Issue #24 - #28
  Sonic's fight against the Metal Sonic (adaption of the CD game).

- Issue #33 - #36
  Sonic meets Knuckles (adaption of the Sonic III game).

- Issue #45, #47 - #53
  Sonic & Knuckles fight Robotnik on the Floating Island, destroy the
  repaired Death Egg and retrieve the Master Emerald from Robotnik
  (adaption of the Sonic & Knuckles game).

- Issue #53 - #58
  Knuckles meets the Chaotix team (adaption of the Knuckles Chaotix game)

- Issue #59 - ?
  The sequel to 'Knuckles Chaotix'.

BTW, if you have any questions about the English Sonic comic from  
Fleetway, about the stories in general or if you just want to send some  
fan-mail, you can now use the following e-mail address:

        stc@richb.demon.co.uk

Some of the letters may even be printed on their Speedlines page (much  
like the Sonic-Grams page in the Archie comic).

Now, here is the list:
