David:

From what I can recall, you certainly have a good imagination regarding the
Sonic characters.  I suggest you mail some brief plot synopses to Sonic
editor Scott Fulop.  "Brief" is the key word.  Unfortunately, due to the
heavy work load, editors do not have the time to read detailed manuscripts.
 I suggest you send him synopses for a minimum of three stories.  Keep the
synopsis of each down to two paragraphs at the most if possible.  Only cover
the main thrusts of the stories, without the extra details that flesh it out
(you'll have to use your judgement on this as to how much is "too much" in
the synopsis stage).  Also, please note that Sega requires the stories to be
action-packed and exciting, yet also humorous.  The stories must have some
funny moments and not be devoid of all humor.  You can send your submissions
to: Scott Fulop, Archie Comic Publications, Inc., 325 Fayette Avenue,
Mamaroneck, NY  10543.  Good luck!
