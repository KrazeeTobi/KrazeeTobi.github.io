Well, last year I got the text of the opening song from the '_Sonic CD_'  
game. I don't know if anyone really might want it or if the song on the  
American CD game is the same, but here goes:

[snip]

10-10 Y'can go again
9-9 Don't fall behind
8-8 Say, don't be late
7-7 Destination heaven
6-5 So stay alive
4-3 Now it's you & me
2-1 We're gonna have some fun
Excalibar - It's not that far
What do y'make - Hey Give & Take
Goin' Home - Time Zone
Check out Egg - He's never alone
Leather'n Lace - Getting in Place
What do y'get - Say - Fast Jet
Doom Room - Cosmic Zoom
Heads up Jake
It's a Sonic Boom
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Toot Toot Sonic Warrior
Your hour is never at hand
You've got the power to save the land
Take a little chance - slip on thru,
You 'gotta survive no matter what you do you gotta do for you
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Toot Toot Sonic Warrior
The power is on your mind
To shake the planets and conquer time
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Deep in Space and Time
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - forever in your mind
Nothing can survive, the will to stay alive,
cause if you try, you can do anything
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Always takes a chance
Toot Toot Sonic Warrior - Never says he can't
Nothing can survive, the will to stay alive,
cause if you try, you can do anything.

Best wishes
