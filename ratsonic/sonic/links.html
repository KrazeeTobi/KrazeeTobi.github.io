The sonic site that was here is shut down. I really have no
interest in this anymore, so please don't email me asking me why.
Here's the links page as it was before I shut down this site.
Hurry up and bookmark any pages you like, cause even this list
of links is going away soon. I have no intention of updating this
list, so don't ask to be added.
<p>
If you want the fan fiction, Bookshire has moved it to his new home at
<a href = http://www.acmelabs.com/~bookshir/>http://www.acmelabs.com/~bookshir</a>.
Yeah, I know it should be bookshire, but usernames on that site are limited to
8 characters, so it's just bookshir.
