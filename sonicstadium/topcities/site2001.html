<font size=2 color=black>From the good start of my site to the slow downhill popularity of the Stadium, I decided it was time for a change, using a template to guide me, which is never the best idea, but I did it anyway, silly me. ^_^ Not only did I miss Updates for Christmas and the New Year, but I had also missed last year's greatest event, SAGE, started by my pal and fellow PS2 hater Blaze Hedgehog, it's basically E3 with Fan games. I kicked myself for missing an Update of that. This year, I would take no more chances.
</table><br>

<table border=0 width=90%><tr><div align=center><font size=3 color=red><b>15th February 2001</font><br>
<font size=2 color=black>For the 'new' look, I needed a server that was bigger than <a href="https://web.archive.org/20020103000000/http://www.angelfire.com"><font color=blue>Angelfire's 50 Meg</a></font>. This was where I started to get greedy, and set off to look for servers that had unlimited web space, but without the annoying ad banners. Pop Ups would be OK though. I found many, but they would not offer space for MP3's which cheesed me off big time. Then I found it - the biggest mistake of my life. I discovered what seemed to be the best server ever - Stas.net (I'm not giving you the link because it's crap!) had unlimited web space without the banners, apparently. Great I thought, so I signed up, and the first problem hit me - it had an on-site FTP access only. Fine I thought, small price to pay. I got the site up after hours and bloody hours of needless uploading through the site, and the 'new look Stadium' was unveiled. I was gutted. ^_^</table>
<a href="oldinteract.html" target=_blank><font color=blue>View the supposedly cool 'new look Sonic Stadium'! This isn't much better to look at either. Well it is, but well...</a></font><br>
I couldn't be bothered to re-create most of the pictures I lost, they didn't look that flash anyway. This was the layout for every single page, and it took an absolute year to load, no thanks in part to stas.net's crappy servers. BTW, the links don't work either on that page.<p><hr width=90%><p>

I did the site, and at least made a report on the next SAGE, which started in January in the first place >_< Ah well, I got it covered. But then it suddenly dawned on me that 2001 is my GCSE year. I didn't think I had the time to revise and sort out my website. I had to take action. I hated my site after a couple of months anyway, and I hated stas.net.<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>29th March 2001</font><br>
I decided to leave updating my site alone for the next few months. I mean, I love website building, but I consider my GCSE grades first and foremost, so again, I told the visitors I would be leaving temporarily, and that I'd be back by my birthday. Of course, no-one ever got to see that message as stas.net decided to crash permanently. On top of the Site FTP, not letting me in my account and being bloody slow, it generally becomes a bitch and stops the Sonic Stadium from loading, as it was on their servers, and locks me out of my account. I got sooooo annoyed, I tell you. In between breaks of revision, I managed to pull together a 'tester' of the proper new look Sonic Stadium, on good old Angelfire.<p>
<a href="temp.html" target=_blank><font color=blue>Take a peek at the main page (untouched!) of the temporary tester new look Sonic Stadium! Never looked this good!</a></font><br>
Yep, Angelfire was my best bet, so I decided to stick with them for the actual homecoming. I actually lied, I said the new look would look like the temp page, but it looks better instead. ^_^ I'm proud of this place!<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>13th June 2001</font><br>
I figured I should make up a new project that should involve the whole of the Sonic community. After all, that is what I'm here for. I looked at all the Fan submission sites - SFGHQ, SSRG, etc, and I thought why not have a fan submission section where ALL the aspects of Sonic fandom are included? It does make sense right? And thus, the Sonic Fan Club was born, and the first of its kind. :D I also wanted to revive Sonic Groove Choons FM, but without the crappy name, so it has been re-christened to 'Sega Sonic Radio'. Ah, not such a lary name now. ^_^ It also has a LOT more music to it than it did before, if people actually got over the cheesy name last time.  I thought of adding a LOT more pages, so I made them, including the BETA games section, the Petitions section, aswell as Sonic Fan Club, and I was preparing the Sonic Adventure 2 information page, but I had to wait for the 23rd for that.
<br>

<p><hr width=90%><p><font color=black>Sonic Fan Club involves everything that is related to Sonic fandom, Fan Games, Fan Art, Fan Fics, the lot. Its strange though, it's such an innovative idea, yet people are pretty wary of the project. There's nothing to be scared of, post your fan stuff to Dreadknux! Whatever it is!<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>29th June 2001</font><br>
Here I am, uploading all the files through CuteFTP into Angelfire, taking bloody ages because there's so much new stuff to upload. Then I realise that I have no more room. ARGH! I was in panic, I had one night to upload all my things. Then I noticed <a href="https://web.archive.org/20020103000000/http://www.topcities.com" target=_blank><font color=blue>Topcities</a></font> that did 150MB of space. Crikey! I signed up, uploaded, and was saved for the day! The new look Sonic Stadium was launched on my birthday aswell. Man was I proud! It took me six months, but I finally got the whole thing sorted!
<p>
<a href="main2.html" target=_blank><font color=blue>View the main page before Dreadknux changed it to make it more neater!</a></font><br>
There were many things I had thought of but canned. One was a frame - I actually warned everyone on the tester main page that this would have a frame. But thanks to the top menu below the very top picture, and a little alteration of the main page, I decided it wasn't necessary after all. This was the main page on launch. It was cool, but after a month, I decided to change it for the better. Now this site is perfect(ish... alright then, it isn't. Hmph!) :)<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>3rd July 2001</font><br>
YEEEEEEEEHAH! Someone's become visitor 1000! Unfortunately, no-one owned up to it for some time though, so I'm setting the record to 1,100 hits. Hey, it's just as memorable! Just wanted to savour this tasty feeling, even though no-one sent me anything about it. Maybe they couldn't see the hit counter...<p><hr width=90%><p>


<p>
<font color=green>*To quote the Simpsons* And, that's all that happened in my life right up to this phone call! ;) I'm updating this history page all the time, adding when I think of a cool idea, or change layouts etc. Memorable moments such as hits go in here too. Stay tuned!</a></font>
