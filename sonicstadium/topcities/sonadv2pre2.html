<font color=green><b>21 April 2001:</b><br><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>Oh my God! Just when you think Sonic Team Can NOT do any better, they throw in more details! Get ready to wipe your chins, people, 'cos you're gonna be drooling for a long time!
<p>
<font color=black><b>
Sonic Team have dished the info on all the characters, and cleverly, kept all the other four characters out of our knowledge for quite a while. Yes, you guessed it, there are again SIX characters, contrary to beliefs of only Sonic and Knuckles making an appearance. The twist is the Good/Evil side to it all. Remember the Light/Dark business? There are three characters that are on the 'Hero' side, and three are on the 'Dark' Side. On top of that, just when you thought that Sonic Team couldn't fit anything else on the GD, here comes a 2-PLAYER MODE! Yes, the Heros and Evils will battle it out in unique 2-Player modes, adding more enjoyment to a milestone of a game. These are the playable characters, their enemies (each Hero has an Evil enemy to hinder their progress), the most of their story, what their 2-Player consists of and more.<p>
<font size=7 face="carlisle" color=red>*HERO SIDE*</font>
<table border=0 width=100%><tr><td><img src="Update/sa2sonic.gif" alt="Well, did you really expect this guy to NOT appear in this game? Come on."><td><div align=center><h2><font face="carlisle" color=green>*Sonic the Hedgehog*</h2></font><font size=2 color=black><b>
As you have guessed, it being a title with the name 'Sonic' on it, the game stars Sonic primarily. The start, the demo shows, has Sonic captured under the clutches of the mysterious 'GUN' group, and is carried off in a Jet plane. The scene has the pilot realising that Sonic has taken out all the guards and has escaped. Sonic then appears on the wing of the plane, into his level, City Escape. His Evil nemesis in the game is a genetic hedgehog being called Shadow, and just like Sonic Adventure before this, the stories and cut scenes are all inter-linked with each other, so expect to see Sonic and Shadow battle it out. Sonic faces a boss called Big Foot in his travels, which, funnily enough, is a robot working for 'GUN'. In the 2-Player Mode, Sonic and Shadow battle it out in a race for the faster and fittest.<br>

Now you know, Tails is indeed a playable character in Sonic Adventure 2! We all know Tails in Cutesy-times past, until today. As new screenshots show, in Tails' Adventure, he is seen controlling a mechbot, which I believe is the Tornado 2 from sonic Adventure! He does love his ols plane, does he Tails. His enemy in his game is none other than the big (fat) cheese, Dr. Eggman himself. As the details were in Japanese I could speculate a guess (hey, I was right with.. oh, I won't spoil it!) that Tails was captured by either Eggman or GUN and Tails job is to escape with the help of his trusty Tornado Transformer, mechbot in disguise! ^_^ The 2-Player consists of Tails Vs. Eggman, in an all-out mechbot war! Ouch, I've said too much too soon, haven't I? -_o<br>

<div align=center><h2><font face="carlisle" color=green>*Knuckles the Echidna*</h2></font>As was discovered before, Knuckles is a playable character in sonic Adventure 2, now he has a new ability, he can swim, which most people knew anyway (again). His whole background is again based on finding missing pieces of the Master Emerald, but it now seems as if there is a competitor for the shards. A female bat that is allied to the Evil side, Rouge, is also after the shards, and it is this character who becomes Knuckles' challenger. The 2-Player mode has Knuckles and Rouge racing for the shards.<br>

Oh yes, Sonic's biological enemy, Shadow, is now controllable on the Evil side. Although not the physically the same, Shadow's type of levels appear to be the same as Sonic's, big loops found once before in Speed Highway can be seen with the new batch of screenshots, and it appears that Shadow inherits Sonic's moves aswell, as we see him doing a bit of a grind across a bridge. His boss is also a 'GUN' robot, like Sonic. This robot is called Big Foot, and looks to be a lean mean piece of cheese. As announced before, the two-player is against Shads and Sonic.<br>

<div align=center><h2><font face="carlisle" color=green>*Dr. 'Eggman' Robotnik*</h2></font>Hah-hah! WHAT did Dreadknux say, eh? Loyal viewers of the Stadium would have seen before the 'Dreadknuxsters First' theory of Eggman being playable, with the item box in the screenshot blah blah. But now you can play as him! Eggman has to resort to battle tactics in his game as he is rudely invaded by a wave of 'GUN' robots. So controlling a mech-bot similar to Tails' convertable Tornado 2, he sets out for revenge. Finally, some 'rotten egg' action in a Sonic game. Nice!<br>

Suddenly, out of the blue, a mystery character appears. Sonic Team are definitely looking for sex appeal, quite a frisky looking creature, this fiesty female bat is after the shards of the Master Emerald, which is also Knuckles' aim. The reason for Rouge wanting the shards is anyone but Sonic Team's guess, this means that there may be more to the plot, and Knuckles will have a bit of a cat-fight... er, bat-fight on his hands.<br>

<font color=black>Well, well, well. Sonic Adventure 2 eh? The timeline of events seem spectacular for it. Sonic Team being famously tightlipped about new Sonic Team games, but was the world ready for them to blurt out that they could pull off two Sonic chums facing off, on the same screen, in 30Hz? Was they ready when they said they could pull off a crisp 60Hz in the 1-player adventure? And what about the siz characters, the 'revival' of Tails (it was rumoured he was not to appear), the appearance of Eggman etc? Well, I don't know what the world would have thought, but one thing is for certain. They were surely impressed. Jesus the world should have been impressed. Sonic Adventure 2 has already landed in Japan, and is arriving on good old USA shores by 22nd June, 8 days before Dreadknux's birthday (serious, I was born 30th June!) and 8 days before the planned re-opening of the Stadium. Of course, as soon as the European SA2 GD arrives this side of the pacific, I'll buy it right away, and have a review with you as soon as I have found every last detail. That could take a while, considering everything that has been announced already. Well, just wait for 22nd June you Americans. It WILL be worth it. Believe you me.<p>

To finish off now, for your entertainment, are pictures of the bosses mentioned in Sonic, Tails and Shadows' adventures:<br>

<font color=green><b>20th February 2001:</b><br><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>Mwahahahahahaaaaaa!!! All you Sonic fanatics prepare yourselves, because Dreadknux has played the SA2 DEMO! Right when Phantasy Star Online was released a week before official release (19th February instead of 27th or something...) your favourite echidna has found the holy disc at the back of the opening. This is the FIRST OFFICIAL UK Review (not including in the magazines, they got theirs early) of the sacred demo, and guess what? You're all invited to see how it well and truly plays like! <br>
Because of this massive extra, all the other updates have been moved <font size="2"><a href="sonadv2pre2.html"><font color=blue>HERE</a></font>. Yeah, like you'll be wanting to see that after this!<p>
<font color=black>Now you'll all find out what the intro with the plane is at the start. You see a plane with the name 'GUN' at the side of it, giving each other orders etc. When the pilot explains that 'The hedgehog' has escaped, and he's rescued the other hostages aswell! This tells us all that Sonic has been captured by some sort of corporation called GUN, and coincidently, thanks to a pointing out from Roareye, the name GUN appears also on the Juggernaut that chases Sonic at the end of the act.<p>
<font color=black>You next see Sonic jumping out of the side door and onto the gun turrets, where the blue one complains about the lack of in-flight movies and sodas. "I feel better off walking" He jokes as he escapes his plane prison by wrenching off some of the plane, and attaching them to his feet. Sonic then jumps into the sky and down to the first level, City Escape.<p>
<font color=black>Much like the snowboard on SA, the start sees you sliding down a San Fransisco style road, enabling you to gain some speed and make some cool tricks as you hit the ramps. From this you gain points, as I'll explain later. After smashing cars, and making 'Awesome' jumps, you get off of your 'board' and onto flat ground. This is where you start to realise how much better this is over the original Sonic Adventure.<p>
<font color=black>You meet a robotic chao called 'Omochao'. He'll tell you interesting moves such as whistling, which Sonic has to do now to retrieve fluffy animals for the Chao Gardens. Press B and Sonic will 'somersault', basically equivalent to a Sonic Spin Attack from Sonic games old and past. Hold down B and you get the Super Spin Attack, untouched since the prequel. A jumps and performs the homing attacks, and pressing Y changes the actions of pressing the B button. For example, press B normally, and you'll Somersault. Press Y then B, and Sonic will Whistle. Quite nifty really.<p>
<font color=black>The first enemies come into play, which can be destroyed using the somersault. Instead of animals that appear in their place once beaten, you get different coloured rods which you can use on Chaos too. The animals will now appear in hidden places, mostly insode pipes found once wooden crates are smashed. Aswell as the normal wooden crate, you'll find a blue coloured crate with a Chao pattern on it. destroy it, and you'll get a 'Chao Key'. Obviously this is meant for the Chao Gardens, but what it exactly does is beyond me, any ideas, email me or post into the Message Board.<p>
<font color=black>After beating a few robots, and taking my time viewing the rather funny, ahem, 'flyers' on the walls such as 'Got Ring?' and 'Playing SA2 can be habit forming: Don't turn off your DC', I now come face to face with some steps, which I could either walk down normally, or do what I did, and GRIND down the railings, collecting rings on the way. This is yet another improvement over SA, the fact that it feels that now Sonic can do anything he wants because he is so fast, and rightly so, as I come across some more speed boosts and runs down a steep road again. Although this time instead of boarding tricks, Sonic does these weird, and rather nifty spiral jumps that can get you more points to your Score.<p>
<font color=black>After getting some Speed Shoes in the air once doing a cool jump trick, Sonic hits a spring at the entrance of some stairs, and I manage to pull off a continuous grind trick after jumping onto each set of railings, then finally, a Restart point appears. It seems quite clear now that the levels have been vastly improved upon over Sonic Adventure, and just looking around and pulling off tricks just seems to take me longer, even at the proficiently faster frame rate that has been largely talked about in this game. I am now experiencing Sonic at his finest, this is clearly the FASTEST Sonic game I have encountered. Pulling off all sorts of tricks and legging it and destroying enemies, all at high speed gives you a tremendous sense of speed, and you're wondering whether it's you playing the game or whether your eyes have melted and your brains gone into hyperdrive.<p>
<font color=black>Sonic team seem to like steep stuff in this level, as now Sonic encounters a very steep grassy hill, with which the blue blur makes no hesitation in going down the slope as fast as he possibly can. Hitting the ramp on the right hand side, I manage to get over the wiring, and into a trail of rings in the air. Unfortunately, you cannot do the light speed dash in this level, although whether you can gain the move later in the game is as yet unknown. More speed boosts, as Sonic races up and around the BIGGEST loop de loop I have ever seen, which then leads to a quick 'jog' down the side of the building, ala Speed highway style, only much much faster.<p>
<font color=black>Bouncing on some springs at the bottom of the drop, Sonic grabs onto some metal bars and starts swinging on them. AND, you guessed it, the blue and spiky one can show off to his heart's content by making impressive jumps on some monkey bars. Then a bit of running later, some more grinding and monkey bar swinging, and then another, slope, which suspiciously you have to pass under using the somersault. Better run once on that slope, because that Juggernaut people have been talking about would right now be up your ass faster than fast grass! (Wow, I was a poet, and I didn't even know it! ^_^) Runnig into the screen away from the jugger, this section has a lot in common with the boulder chasing section in Lost world in the original SA. After this part, a giant gold 'Goal Ring' stands there, waiting for you to jump through it. Then, your score is totalled up, and you are ranked according to what score you get at the end.<p>
<font color=black>This is why there is a points scheme, like I said earlier, in the game. It's kind of like the three Challenges in each level in SA in order to gain Emblems, only in this game, getting a rank A is nigh on impossible. Post in if you have managed that glorifying rank, I've only managed a C rank. You get points for nearly everything, the swinging on the bars, the grinding, especially at the ramps at the slopey hills of the level, where you can perform bitchin' moves. Hell, even a RING gains you 10 points. The only thing is, when you die, you lose your whole score, so better not die on stupid places like to bottomless sections of the level.<p>
<font color=black>So, you honestly want my opinion on this demo? ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! If anybody complains otherwise, feel free to complain, so we can all slap you with a wet haddock. It is true what my buddies Kulock and my other USA pals tell me, this will blow you away. Think of Sonic Adventure. Now think of it at a speed about two or three times the speed already on SA. Then, add some cool moves you can do, such as grinding and swinging (don't laugh, not that kind of swinging. Or Grinding either, you sick people). Finally, add more graphics, a better frame rate and every aspect of SA basically tweaked to the extreme? NOW you may have an idea of how good this is. Like I said before, PSO came out a week early, as is the trend these days, remember Shenmue? So get it now, and you'll experience the fantastic things that I've been trying to tell you just now. Three words to end this matter about PSO, and SA2 Demo. GET. IT. IN. NOW. Damn, wait that's four words... argh.<p>

<font color=green><b>13th January 2001:</b><br><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><B>Those of you waiting for SA2 to be arriving this month, it ain't gonna happen. Don't you just HATE rumours? >_< According to the ODM (Official Dreamcast Magazine), the game is expected to be shifted in May in the UK. That's a probable mean delay, but hey, hopefully Sonic Shuffle will be released in-between as a fill-gap? Or maybe not... :(<p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>BUT (-head. hee hee hee ^_^) new leaks of screenshots from the magazine and an article explains that Sonic will now be able to grind (but you knew that) AND swing on bars! And, instead of animals being freed from robots in order to nurture your chao, you will find odd little rods. Apparently these will be compatible somehow with your virtual pet.<p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>So, where are the animals to gain your chao abilities? Don't fret, Sonic Team haven't taken that element out, that would be just silly. Instead, Sonic has to whistle (!) near bushes or bins in order to grab the little critters' attentions.<p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>And also, purchasing Phantasy Star Online will grant you a free playable demo of SA2, and a movie, and guess what? Phantasy Star Online WILL be coming out in February. So, aswell as another great game from Sonic Team we also get a demo of what is being hoped as the greatest Sonic game yet! Expect the Dreadknuxster to tell you ALL about it as soon as it comes! Now, wasn't that the spirit-raising update you were hoping for, instead of the phony release update (6th Jan)? ^_^<p>
</div><font color=green><b>6th January 2001:</b><br><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black>Hey, we have an UPDATE here, people! The most anticipated Sonic game ever has been released in the USA in the form of a demo, those lucky Americans able to play a preview version of Sonic Adventure 2. My web buddy Kulock has reviewed it, for any of you desperate to find out how it plays. <a href="https://web.archive.org/20020113000000/http://www.mooglecavern.com/index2.shtml" target=_blank><font color=blue>CLICK HERE</a></font> to find out from the Moogle man himself!<p> 
<font size="2"><font color=black>Of course, me being in the UK, I can't tell you much on how it plays (although I'm DYING to play it!), but I can tell you that Sonic Team has upped the frame rate to 60fps!!! I've seen things of it, and it looks so fast, Sonic must have been drugged or rabid or something, it was going SO fast. Considering that Sonic Adventure was not very fast (although Speed Highway was extremely fast, given the chance), this game more than makes up for it in speed. !AND! Given the rumour that Sonic Adventure is to be released earlier than the March date, you've got plenty to be excited about! Go go go YEAH! Erm, yes. Got carried away there. It hasn't arrived yet... And now, if you've missed my first opening to Sonic Adventure 2 Preview, here it is...<p> 
</div><font color=green><b>Initial Page Opening:</b><br><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=blue>Sonic Adventure 2, eh? Probably the most anticipated Sonic game to date. And you know why? If you don't, you'll find out right about now! The story and the plot itself is rather scarce, but what we do know at the mo is exciting everyone, especially the old Dreadknuxster here! The least of all because Sonic's 10th Anniversary is drawing nigh, and Sonic Team are beavering away in order to obtain a worldwide release date and to make this the BEST Sonic game to date!!!<p> 
<font size="2"><font color=#ffc000>
The whole plot is uncertain, but looking at the Sonic Adventure 2 Trailer (which you can download), the basis of the story seems to be about opposites of certain things. It describes 'Love' and 'Hate' and 'Good' and 'Evil'. Could this be an indication of any kind of an evil composition of our dear Sonic, much like the Metal Sonic and Metallix before it? It may just be my imagination, but those metal Sonic replications in Eggman's base (Where you have to go to get to 'Final Egg') in Sonic Adventure seem a bit too peculiar to be just for display. Could these be?<p>
<font size="2"><font color=red>More info will be added to this page, aswell as movie downloads and extra pictures, when Dreadknux gets them. Until then, take a butcher's at these lovely lookin' lot. Love Sonic. Love the Sonic Stadium. LOVE Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Team.
<p><font size="2"><font color=black>Collecting ALL of the past information and the new, I can tell you roughly what has just happened @ E3, and what's up with the <a href="sonadv2shots.html">Screenshots</a>. So here goes. The movie from E3 2000 showcases the game for two minutes, and features opposites (well, it's obvious isn't it?) of different assortments. 
It showcases Sonic a lot (well duh! ^_^) and Knuckles (Ooh, well done!) in parts, with Eggman in certain sections. It goes on to feature 'Original' and 'Fake' and 'A Top Secret Weapon'. The Master emerald is included and so is the prospect of 'Ultimate Life'. <p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>As much as we looked, Sonic and Knuckles were the only characters shown to the public. It seems that Sonic's trusty friend Tails will not be joining the bandwagon again. Oh dear. Oh well! As far as screenshots are concerned, well, the old saying a picture says a thousand words would DEFINITELY sum this little lot up. The most interesting features Knuckles' new 
special move, and a cut scene shot from Sonic's story possibly, involving Sonic wearing handcuffs and the like, jumping out of an army(?) plane. You can bet your LIFE that the cute little Chaos will make a return, and now it looks like they can do a lot more than cry, draw, make love and try to start a punch up.<p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>Thanks to Sonic Team's Fall Festival, we have been given CHUNKS of info, whether in the right order or not seems uncertain. We know that Sonic is now capable of stunts unbelieveable, i.e doing grinds on walls with his sneakers. We also know that Knuckles, between his break between Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, seems to be taking swimming lessons at the local Sonic Team pool. Yes that's right, Knuckles can swim!
But the best is yet to come. Ooh yes...<p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>As revealed as some of our later screenshots, we see Dr. Robotnik (Eggman) in a new hovercraft. But one of those shots contain...Eggman being controlled?
This is just a 'Sonic Stadium Theory', but I believe judging by the screenshot, Eggman is playable. <a href="pics/Screenshots/sonadv2_21.jpg"><font color=blue>Click here</a></font> to see for yourself. You'll notice an item box in the background...
And that's most of the juicy info that Sonic Team have let rip at the mo. Any more info will be updated in this page, so stay tuned to the Sonic Stadium!!! Until then, I leave you with a Press Release from SEGA about the game at E3 in 2000...
