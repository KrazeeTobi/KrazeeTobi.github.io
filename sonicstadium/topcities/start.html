<font size=2 color=black>I have always been a fan of Sonic. Always. Ever since the very first Sega home console, the Master System, which I bought instead of a Mega Drive. As Playstation started to unfortunatley take over, Sonic mania died down and down. I got a Saturn and N64, and enjoyed them both, but the love for Sonic slowly started to die as I grew up. Although I always had a little bit of fanaticism for Sonic, it was not as great as Sonic's image became too... childish. Then a while ago, I discovered the Moogle Cavern. Can't remember who from, I think I just stumbled across it one day, and this site was based heavily about Sonic, Mario and other things. For some time now I had been visiting the Moogle Cavern and its massive catalogue of Sonic hoaxes. They all made me laugh. As I visited the site more and more the Sonic fanaticism of old started to grow again, as nostalgia took over. One day, I decided that I could make a website and do good stuff for all those online Sonic fans out there. So, as my mum's new PC arrived earlier this year, I learned simple HTML and got to work on my Sonic Site. I needed a name, Sonic Stadium sounded catchy, and was the former name of Sonic Crackers, for those who don't know. So Sonic Stadium it was then.

<font size=2 color=black>Looking for a decent url, I couldn't be either bothered or afford to pay for one. I found SonicRoms.Org, who had a NameZero account. Back then NameZero didn't get back to you in six weeks for a free domain, so I made friends with webmaster ElectroSonic Dan, and got a sonic-stadium.com address, since someone already had sonicstadium.com, then decided they didn't want it and left it free after I reserved my - address. >_< I released my website on this very day, with the help of <a href="https://web.archive.org/20020103000000/http://www.angelfire.com" target=_blank><font color=blue>Angelfire</a></font> and an FTP program. Unfortunatley most of the old pages have been saved over, but here are some of the pages I managed to save.</table>
<a href="oldmain.html" target=_blank><font color=blue>See the very first Sonic Stadium layout! Beware, it ain't a pretty site! Ha, geddit?</a></font><br>
I had to totally re-create this page from my memory, as I accidently deleted it >_< But, the Text in the announcement box IS the original! Plus, don't bother clicking on the links, they only take you back to the same page.<p><hr width=90%><p>

As time went on, I started to add some stuff to my site, including some of the sections you see in the Stadium today, and other not-so-innovative things, but hell I did try. ^_^ Here's the original text for the first Update I did for you lot...<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>24th October 2000</font><br>
<font color=blue>Well, this is my first update, and I'm pretty much settling into my web home, it's very nice. A few of you have replied back to me and commented on my website, and (Thank the Lord! ^_^) people seem to like it a lot. A few niggles were commented on, but I'm on a role here and it's probably sorted out anyway. <br>
<font color=orange>What's changed, you may ask? Well, at the bottom of each page there now should be an extra 'navibar', called "Online Shop". That includes another new section of my site where you can buy many a Sonic/Dreamcast item from those lovely blokes at Amazon.co.uk. Aren't they nice, eh? I've also got a 'News' section up and running, so go check that out for the latest Sonic and DC news. There's also the FIRST Sonic Stadium Poll going over there on the left. Be sure to respond. Every vote counts. <br>
<font color=red>Again, as this is my first update, something's gonna go wrong. But if something does, do not panic, just mail me with your comments, complaints and I'll either thank you personally or sort it out (depending which of the two you send me). Next update soon, but until then, stay ICE.</font><p><hr width=90%><p>
<font color=black>Ah yes, the fabled Online Shop. I do remember it well. Although after three months and no purchases there was really no point in keeping it, and I had to regularly update it with new releases, so in the end I just got rid of it. Pretty soon I started to add the Downloads page and more, and I added the Sonic Stadium Message Board, which has been desolate since day one ^_^ and a guestbook, along with a new Radio Station soon after, called 'Sonic Groove Choons FM'. I know, it was a crap name. Original Update text from 18th November 2000<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>18th November 2000</font><br>
<font color=blue>
Hi there all you Sonic fanatics! Well, I promised something for all you guys and I'm about to reveal my new zones for the Stadium! Introducing 'Community' and 'Art' sections of my zone! 
<br>
<font color=orange>In 'Community' you can sign my Guestbook, view what you have written and send messages on my all new Message Board! Talk about whatever you want. 'Art' is just that - Sonic art. There's the box art, official art, screenshots and your fan art, which shall open soon (assuming people send me fan art of course. USUAL MAIL ADDRESS!) 
<br>
<font color=red>It seems that a lot of people like my site. Aswell as getting a good response from the poll, it seems that over 70 people have visited since the Stadium started since it opened about two-three weeks ago! Thanks everyone. Made my day! AND some rumours have leaked about new info on a past Sonic game, want to know what it is? I... CANNOT SAY! Not just yet, nothings been said YET. You now have a right to be in MY good mood now. Any probs, you know what to do. <br>
<font color=green>Unfortunately, where there's good news, there's almost always BAD news. I surfed on my site on my Dreamcast, and the site looked all over the place, so don't even attempt to go on my site on your DC's. A pain I know, but I'll try and get it fixed soon. ^_^ 
<p><hr width=90%><p><font color=black>Yeah, that 'new info on a past game' was actually referring to an event in the Moogle Cavern Message Board. A Member found the e-mail address to someone at Sega who was involved with Sonic X-Treme for the Saturn, a game which got canned. This MB member e-mailed the Sega bloke, with questions about the canned game, and he replied with many answers. Although it was promised that more new Sonic X-Treme info would be unveiled soon, it was not to be, so I got you all excited for nothing ^_^ Still, good to be in a happy mood eh?<p><hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=red><b>December 2000</font><br>
Strangely (?) enough, after that my site started off OK for a webby that had just been released, things started to go downhill as even though I tried to Update the best I could, I wasn't capturing people's attention. Well, thanks in part to the pants name, Sonic Groove Choons FM had absolutely no visitors, and I couldn't understand why people were not posting in my Message Board. I decided, come December, that it was time for a change of layout. So, I informed the visitors that I would not be updating for a while, and I started looking for a template that looked good. "Lesson 1: Never build your site from a template." Whereas you can build your own layout and edit it yourself, you don't know what the HTML is for the template, and for a guy like me trying to edit it, I only got confused as I tried to figure out which section of HTML triggered which part of the page. This 'new' look ran right into the new year and through Christmas, which I missed to Update, and made me more popular >_< (^_^)
