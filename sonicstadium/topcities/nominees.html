<font size=2 color=white><b>Shadow of a Hedgehog: <font color=orange>It seems all the Wallpapers and Screensavers weren't just a waste of time... ^_^<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Robo Blast 2 Official Site: <font color=#ffc000>Oooh, now its getting nasty. SOAH, V. SFGHQ, V. The best Fan Game ever!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Roms.co.uk: <font color=orange>Ow! This is tough! Now Dan's fab collection of ROM's make it into this category.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Hacking Community: <font color=#ffc000>And, to make the competition harder, here's the best site all about hacking Sonic games.<br>

<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Information Station:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic HQ: <font color=#ffc000>One of the most popular Sonic sites there is, undoubtedly gets a spot.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic News: <font color=orange>The first of many nominations for the great Affiliate of the Stadium's, Sonic News.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Stuff Research Group: <font color=#ffc000>The webmaster has left, unfortunately, but SSRG is still unmatched in Sonic secrets.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>TT's Sonic 2 Beta Site: <font color=orange>Lots of info in this little site, well worth a look.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>The Sonic Stadium: <font color=#ffc000>WTF?!? o_O Seems like you guys like the Back Catalogue of Sonic games info, huh? ^_^<br>


<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Sonic Boom Box:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Blaze Fire Radio: <font color=#ffc000>People liked this not only for Sonic music, but the rest of the cool music too.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sega Sonic Radio: <font color=orange>Well, it's not illegal, but it sure surprised me! Only been open for a few months now, SSR seems to be getting more popular by the minute.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Music HQ: <font color=#ffc000>Mastered by Edan Koch, this site has mucho Sonic midis!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>VG Music: <font color=orange>This site excells in both Sonic and Video Game midis.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>OverClocked ReMix v2.0: <font color=#ffc000>This small site has many MP3s, and lots of video game remixes, all that they made themselves! A brilliant work of art (well, music anyway), and most of them are Sonic remixes. A cool site.<br>


<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Fan's Hero:<td width=60%><div align=center>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Rlan - SFGHQ: <font color=#ffc000>Come on, this guy basically helped turn Fan Gaming creation into a cult!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Tristan - TSSZ: <font color=orange>Always up to date, no wonder you guys favoured Tristan a lot!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Team Junior - SRB 2: <font color=#ffc000>They're about to re-write the history of Fan Games as we know it. No surprise this popped up.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Matrixx Hedgehog: <font color=orange>The 'Master Spriter' as he has become more popularly known. Made sprites for famous Webmasters such as Kulock. Very respected spriter.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>A.J. Freda - SSNTails.org: <font color=#ffc000>Yes, the guy that owned the ORIGINAL www.segasonic.net domain name, yes one of the first Sonic sites released online, and yes, still reknowned for his work and help, whether it be his midis or his hosting scheme, among many others. A big player in the Sonic community.<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Favourite Forum:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>The Moogle Cavern MB: <font color=#ffc000>Anybody who's anybody must have fallen a cropper for the wonderful residents that reside in the MC MB, and made the word 'Kulock' a household name. OK then, but old Ku's pretty popular in this department!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>TSF MB: <font color=orange>Despite not being an Ezboard, and having to register to post, Kedzie K's MB is pretty darn good. And popular.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>SFGHQ MB: <font color=#ffc000>Rlan's MB is the #1 spot for Fan Game creation help, and other chit chatter!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>H Hog's Message Board: <font color=orange>H Hog's MB is getting pretty warm to go to, many people posting there at the moment.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic 2 Beta MB: <font color=#ffc000>This MB is very interesting and talks about, well, Sonic 2 Beta, natch. A lot of people turn up here, and is a tough contender.<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Most Evolved Site:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Flying Fox: <font color=#ffc000>Flying Fox's site has changed appearance much over the time it has been open, but it's looking pretty cool now!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Stadium: <font color=orange>Again, I'm flattered, but... why? Someone must have been here since the dawn of time (Well, October last year - This February ^_^) to notice the changes here. Nice to know I have some long time fans...<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic News: <font color=#ffc000>Yes, Andrew's site has been a pretty basic interfacial affair, until just recently, when he's suddenly come up with all this fab HTML fry-up!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Shark Attack's Chao World: <font color=orange>A project that started its life early on as a very colourful and limited site. Now, SharkAttack has re-vamped the site, a very professional one too, with the top Chao information you can find! Includes other features such as Roareye's hoaxes and animations.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>BS Freakzone: <font color=#ffc000>Sambo 9000's Website, this site is all about Fan Games, although soon Sonic Fan Games will emerge from here. Before this change in site, there was a different interface, which I'm sure Sambo probably hated, so he changed it ^_^. It looks much better now.<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Favourite Webmaster:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Andrusi - The FBZ: <font color=#ffc000>Andrusi admits he has a seriously large ego, but we won't put that against him... for now ^_^<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Andrew - Sonic News: <font color=orange>Woah, for a site that has been open as short a time as the Stadium itself, it's gained a fair few submissions!<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>H Hog - H Hog's Zone: <font color=#ffc000>The friendliest person I know, and most of you know too, it seems. Unfortunately his site's down...<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Electro Sonic Dan - Sonic Roms.co.uk: <font color=orange>The leading guy in Sonic ROMS, and general nice bloke too. We love you Dan! :D<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Rlan - SFGHQ: <font color=#ffc000>How can anyone not like this guy? According to lot.<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Most Colourful Site:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Floating Islands: <font color=#ffc000>Colour, colour, everywhere for this Sonic site.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Iris & Sonic's Vacation spot: <font color=orange>Hasn't been open for that long, but still very colourful.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Predestined Persona : Zero.Two: <font color=#ffc000>This is a very colourful Sonic site, and full of the good stuff too. Check it out - it could win your approval.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>H Hog's Zone: <font color=orange>Always bright and cheerful, H Hog's humble webby is as colourful as the common Sonic game itself, and is also packed with hoaxes and the like.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>SonKnuck's Sonic World: <font color=#ffc000>SonKnuck runs the show here, and his hot count just proves how cool his site is. There is surprisingly a lot of original material, a very rare thing in Sonic sites these days.<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>News for the People:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic News: <font color=#ffc000>Apparently, more people voted for this than TSSZ. Odd, but the name kinda speaks for itself, so who am I to judge?<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>TSSZ: <font color=orange>An obvious choice, Tristan's "The Man" when it comes to news, most of you agree.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>IGNDC: <font color=#ffc000>A major video games site, they also bring you the latest in DC and Sonic news.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Planet Dreamcast: <font color=orange>A very good news resource about Sonic, Sega and the DC, obviously.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Shadow of a Hedgehog: <font color=#ffc000>SOAH has a lot to say in the Sonic News department. Indeed, you'll find the big stories end up there.<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Worth It Award:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>SuperKnux Network: <font color=#ffc000>It's been a while since it's been updated, but according to most of you, it's worth it.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>The Sonic Foundation: <font color=orange>Strange, since this site is basically updated every day o_O No matter, it's your submissions that count, so TSF's in there.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>The Moogle Cavern: <font color=#ffc000>God, I've heard this one before. The day Kulock actually (properly) updates, may just be the day the world explodes...<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic HQ: <font color=orange>One of the biggest Sonic Fan Sites out there, indeed it is worth the wait for Vector to update with a decent array of Sonic goods, as Updating seems to have gone amiss at the site for a while.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Keith's Sonic Site: <font color=#ffc000>A small but great Sonic site, choc-a-blok with Sonic goodness. Just the kind of site Dread likes. I saw last Update date, and frankly, it'll be worth it if Keith decides to Update soon, mark my words...<br>
<tr><td width=20%><div align=center><font size=2 color=darkorange><b>Overall Best Sonic Site:<td width=60%><div align=center><font size=2 color=white><b>Shadow Of A Hedgehog: <font color=#ffc000>Oooh, so many of you wanted to be in here, but by a pinch, SOAH makes in first with most submissions from Phase 1.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic News: <font color=orange>Many Sonic News nominations, I wasn't surprised people voted this one.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Hacking Community: <font color=#ffc000>Damian Grove and fans thinks he knows his stuff. The site's certainly cool on Hacking (hence the name, see...)<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic Stuff Research Group: <font color=orange>Again, the Webmaster has left. If another will replace them, who knows. But it'll be nice to see the efforts of this site be recognised.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic HQ: <font color=#ffc000>And, the big boy. One of the biggest Sonic Fan Sites out there - period. Can it grab the top trophy?<br>
