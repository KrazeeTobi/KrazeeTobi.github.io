<font color=red>December, 2001 [PHASE 3: <font color=orange>29TH DECEMBER!</font>]</font><br>
Here's another update for the Sonic Site Awards, the biggest Sonic event it seems this year. Which is nice. I'm updating this page merely to report that the PHASE of polling for your favourite Sonic site closes NOVEMBER 30TH!!! It's the final week of official polling, and it could be YOU that can turn the whole runnings in a totally opposite direction, even at this late stage. The Form is below. Read the next update below this too - it is details [AND AN INVITATION - FOR EVERYONE!] for the final details of the Sonic Site Awards Phase 3: The Ceremony. Everyone is invited to find out the winners of all the categories - Who will win eh? Who? It's almost intriuging... ^_^ <br>

<font size=2>

<font size=2 color=white><b>OK, you've all been sitting on the edge of your seats for it, I can tell what question you are going to ask - WHEN WILL THE WINNERS BE ANNOUNCED DREADKNUX, YOU SCURVY TEASER YOU!? Ah, the magic begins. For now it is time you got in on the little secret...<p>

The Sonic Stadium's Sonic Site Awards 2001 has had a phenomenal response, it's the biggest thing this year. So, naturally, to announce the winners would need some kind of... celebration, say. And yes, I have thought of everything. ^_^ The Sonic Site Awards PHASE 3: The Ceremony, as it's dubbed, will be taking place...
<font size=2 color=darkorange>DECEMBER 29TH!!!</font>
That's the last Saturday OF THE <u>YEAR</u>, just a few days before the New Year. :) The time of the event will occur...<br>
<font size=2 color=darkorange>3:00 <u>PM</u> GMT (UK), 10:00 <u>AM</u> for the USA!!!</font> Got that? Make sure you have, as time zones are about five hours apart from the United Kingdom and the USA, there has to be two seperate times. So, British Sonic Fans, make a date that afternoon, and US Sonic chums, clear everything you have set for that Saturday morning.<p>
<font size=3 color=darkorange>MAKE SURE YOU HEAD FOR THE SONIC STADIUM AT THAT TIME <U>EARLY</U>!!!!!</font><p>
Please please please, make your way to the Sonic Stadium BEFORE the 3:00pm/10:00am time, that is paramount, otherwise you may be late for the results! What you must do is head to the Sonic Stadium, as normal. The main page will be replaced temporarily with a special PHASE 3: The Ceremony page, with an intro to the event, a link to the Sonic Stadium if you must choose not to turn up, and links to (1) A Universal Free Chat Room, (2) The Sonic Stadium's Message Board and most importantly (3) Sega Sonic Radio.<p>

Why all the links? Because the whole ceremony's totally interactive! All visitors will head for the Chat Room, along with the nominees (ALL NOMINEES ARE EXPECTED TO TURN UP!) and chat to each other throughout the whole ceremony, bringing the community much closer together than ever before. But, where's Dreadknux you ask? And how's the results gonna be announced? Simple... This is where I do all the hard work. ^^ Dreadknux will be online, and announcing the winners in the <font color=red>FIRST EVER SEGA SONIC RADIO LiVECAST!</font>, so visitors can simply listen to the broadcast to find out who's won. Also in the LiVECAST show, there'll be decent Sonic music of all sorts, special Sonic remixes, and other Sonic songs previously never heard before on Sega Sonic Radio! Should the winners want to leave a speech (I mean, WHEN the winners...), they can do so either instantaneously on the Chat Room, or leave it in a Topic on the Sega Sonic Message Board.<p>
After the whole ceremony, the first edition of the monthly 'Sega Sonic Radio: LiVECAST' show will be Live and ready, from yours truly himself. Cor blimey, what a day it'll be! There's a poll on the <a href="index.html">Sonic Stadium splash page</a>, asking people if they will turn up to the event. Vote in the poll now - and expect news about this event on many a Message Board, and exclusively on TSSZ News... It should be great fun, and I'm hoping it'll be a online Sonic event to remember. All Sonic Fans of all levels of fanaticism will be there - the question is, will you? Make sure you set a date, and turn up to the biggest Sonic event of the YEAR!<p>

<font color=orange>If there are ANY problems regarding the event (Except the dates, I am not changing them...) such as hearing disabilities (which will make it hard to listen to the winners) and other problems, please please <a href=mailto:dreadknux@knuckles.co.uk>contact Dreadknux immediately!</a> Don't leave it until the last minute, as I won't be able to help you!

<font color=white>Dreadknux will not vote for ANY Site, whether it be an affiliate site, the Sonic Stadium itself, or any other site. Therefore, all the votes are strictly in the public's hands. It is the voice of the PEOPLE, not me you know ^_^</font></font><p></a>

<font size=2 color=white><b>Shark Attack's Chao World: <font color=orange>A project that started its life early on as a very colourful and limited site.

<font size=2 color=white><b>The Moogle Cavern: <font color=#ffc000>God, I've heard this one before. The day Kulock actually (properly) updates, may just be the day the world explodes...<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Sonic HQ: <font color=orange>One of the biggest Sonic Fan Sites out there, indeed it is worth the wait for Vector to update with a decent array of Sonic goods, as Updating seems to have gone amiss at the site for a while.<br>
<font size=2 color=white><b>Keith's Sonic Site: <font color=#ffc000>A small but great Sonic site, choc-a-blok with Sonic goodness. Just the kind of site Dread likes. I saw last Update date, and frankly, it'll be worth it if Keith decides to Update soon, mark my words...<br>
