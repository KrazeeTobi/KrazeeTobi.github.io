<div align=center><B><font size=2 color=black>In the past, Sega have had tough competition from an old respected rival called Nintendo. Consequently, Sonic and Mario were constantly fighting for Number One spot in people's lives (of course the hedgehog won!). But aside from Ninty, who have been Sega and Sonic's rivals, past and new? Well, here's the lowdown on the bad boys.<p>

<div align=center><img src="Update/nintendo.gif"><td><div align=center><font size=4 color=red><b>Nintendo<br><B><font size=2 color=black>A foe of days past, Nintendo and Sega were constantly fighting for success during the early to mid 1990's (ah those were the days... ^_^), and I must say Ninty pulled off some impressive games such as Zelda and Starwing (Starfox in US). While Nintendo conquered in Japan, it was the Mega Drive that ruled supreme with the west side of the globe. Despite their game rivalry in the past, the two companies have nothing but the utmost respect for each other, and Sonic Team are to start developing all major titles in the future for GameCube, so Sonic fans know what the next console is now!

<div align=center><img src="Update/mario.gif"><td><div align=center><font size=4 color=red><b>Mario<br><B><font size=2 color=black>What came from Nintendo's bowels brought forth their mascot, Mario 'Mario' Mario. It was Mario who started off the whole platforming thing, but all other companies that followed the genre was just pointless rip-offs of the game. Until Sonic the Hedgehog came along that was. It was the entrance of Sonic that Mario had a feud on his fat little hands, and even now, since Sonic Team are developing for GameCube, there's even more mascot rivalry going on for best game character. But, with games released at totally different times, and a Mario game hardly appearing after Mario 64, it doesn't seem that Sonic moving platforms would make a difference.

Hooray. That WAS sarcastic BTW. Thanks to being sell outs to the older audience, which Sega had an audience for in the first place (oh come on, you can't tell me that Sony actually brought older people to video games, Sega had already done it) their first toilet console, the Sony Gaystation actually was popular. People must have been on the drugs. Now, after Sega's move to third party, games such as Crazy Taxi and Virtua Fighter 4 are coming to the originally named Playstation 2. About time, the console desperately needs some decent games...

Not that the games were imaginitive anyway - the levels were linear, but in its defence, I sort of like it - and now that Universal, the company responsible for Crash, has fallen out with Sony, Sony may be heading for a tumble. Although I haven't heard news of a new Crash game yet...

Blatantly big headed company, they claim to be the world's leading video games developer with their bog-all knowledge of imaginitive game creating and their endless, pointless, getting so stupid that no-one even buys them anymore, sports games. When Sega had announced third party developing, EA knew they were soon to 'lose their crown', so what do they do? They take a stab at Sega. Jealous pathetic ponces. No-one likes change, but believe me, Sega are GOING to get themselves heard whether EA like it or not. Sorry chaps, no more scones left old boy. Counter-acted Sega's third party plan with news that they will be developing for GameCube too, but made a boo-boo even then when they said they were placing their bets on Playstation 2. Oooh, wrong answer EA. So close, but not even third party publishers say that kind of thing. Dumbasses.
