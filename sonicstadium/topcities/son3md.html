<B><font size=4 color=red><u>Introduction</u></font><p>
<font size=1><b>Everyone now should know the actual concept of Robotnik and the Chaos Emeralds, but the Sonic saga has now taken a twist.
A new character, Knuckles the Echidna, is guardian of a very special Emerald. This is called the Master Emerald. It is even more precious and powerful than all of the seven chaos emeralds.<p>
This Master Emerald is situated on an island floating in the sky, high above Mobius named the Floating Island, or better known as Angel Island. This is also where Knuckles is destined to stay and live, guarding this precious emerald from anything that could harm it.<p>
Robotnik discovers this fact and believes that this Master Emerald could power his now run-down Death Egg, for a long time. In fact, forever! He decides to try and trick Knuckles into letting Robotnik on his side, and therefore have access to the Master Emerald. Obviously not very local, Knuckles does not know a lot of people on Mobius and is fooled into thinking that Robotnik is really a good guy! What's more is that Eggman convinces Knuckles that Sonic and Tails are the ones after the Master Emerald to rule the world and spread evil!<p>
Still with us? Good. After the final battle from 'Sonic 2', the blue blur and Tails also decide to visit Angel Island. But as Sonic is arriving, Knuckles intercepts him and nicks off with all of the Chaos Emeralds that Sonic had collected from Sonic 2. Theif. It's up to Sonic to save the day again. But with a native to the Island on Robotnik's side, will the challenge be too much for Sonic?<p>
On top of that, Robotnik has control of all of the zones! But he still has not found the Chaos Emeralds yet, and that's a good thing. Sonic and Tails have come to stop Robotnik, gain the Chaos Emeralds and destroy his Death Egg for
good!<p>

<font size=2><b>Well, here we are with Sonic 3, which has had a total overhaul in graphics and gameplay. Sonic and Tails 
look much better than in Sonic 2 and a new addition to the Sonic party has made his first appearance-Knuckles the Echidna. Now on Robotnik's side, this native will do everything in his power to bring Sonic down.
Sonic and Tails have a lot on their plate. To bring down Eggman, evade Knuckles and to retrieve all seven Chaos Emeralds? They've got their work cut out for them, eh?

<font size=2><b>Because fatboy is pretty wary of Sonic's actions after the last two games, he makes sure that every act of every zone is covered with a boss robot. Whereas not as difficult as Robotnik, these robots appear at the end of act 1 of every zone. Yes they do get meaner, but so does Robotnik, who still makes an  appearance at the end of act 2 of every zone. At the end, you must infiltrate (I like that word!) Eggman's Launch Base Zone and bring his evil plans down!

<font size=2><b>After Knuckles scarpered with all of Sonic's precious Chaos Emeralds, it's your job to get them back! You do this by finding a giant ring anywhere within a zone. Jump through it and you will be taken to the all new 3D Special Stage! To accomplish this stage, you must run over the blue spheres, while avoiding the red ones. Run over all of the blue spheres and you gain a Chaos Emerald. Running over groups of spheres (say, run over all the outside spheres in a square of blue spheres), and rings will appear. If you collect all of the rings possible in the Special Stage, you will gain 500,000 points (an extra life).

<font size=2><b>No more will you have to depend on repeating each level to complete the game each time you turn the Mega Drive off. Why? Because of Sonic Team's backup save data which is included on the cartridge. Start a game in any of the 'NEW' spaces and whenever you complete a zone, the file you are playing will automatically save for you. You can start a game as Sonic, Tails, or Sonic and Tails, and now Tails can use his flying abilities in game, and if two players are playing (Sonic and Tails) Player 2 can fly and grab hold of Sonic so he can reach places that he normally can't! Cool, eh?

<font size=2><b>Sonic Team have taken everything from the last two Sonic games and have made them 10 times better. One particular feature I'm talking about is the advanced 2-Player competition. You can now race a Grand Prix (a set of levels played one at a time), a Match Race (just one level race) and a Time Attack mode where you can race any level and test your speed! You can set items in play, and these include banana skins, enemies, rings, speed shoes, slow shoes and the switch around item from Sonic 2. AAAAND, you can play as either Sonic, Tails or even Knuckles!!! Without a doubt, this is one of (if not the) best Sonic games you can possibly get for the Mega Drive! If you find it, get it!
