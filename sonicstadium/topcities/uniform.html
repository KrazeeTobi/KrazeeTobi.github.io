<p>
<div align=center><B><font color=black>Here is what is called the Universal Form. Why? Well, to save your precious time and effort, I wondered, "Why let faithful Stadium fans go out all the way to log into their e-mail, type in my address etc. when all I requested was about five or six sentences of site opinions, and whatever?" So, if you need to send Dreadknux any written info, please don't hesitate to send via the form. It's great hearing from you.<p>
The other reason why it's Universal is that I didn't really want to go into all the trouble of making about 60 form pages, so I bundled all the subjects requested from the Stadium into a drop down menu. You can either choose from the relevant list for the info to give to me, or if you just feel like saying Hi, and you've got nothing better to do, just choose the last one in the menu, but all other topics must stay in their subjects.<p>
Unfortunately, although you can now send text messages to Dreadknux without any 'going to your e-mail account' hassle, anything for sections such as Downloads or SFGC (Sonic Fan Games Club) that asks for you to send in actual programs, art and stuff, you still need to send that via e-mail, seeings as you gotta upload the thing, then send it. UNLESS you already have it online, then you can just tell me where your stuff is, and I'll do the rest. So, sorry about that. Hey, don't let that discourage you though, at least you don't have to go all the way to your e-mail just to say a four letter sentence. ^_^
