<font color=black><b>I'm not the only Sonic fan in the Universe. God, no... my friend, there are hundreds, possibly millions of Sonic fans just like you and me, who also have their own cool Sonic sites!<p>
Which brings you to this fine cave, my fellow Sonic mentalist. Included on this very page are some of the finest Sonic sites available on the web! Click on any of the links to be taken to the corresponding site. Just tell 'em the Dreadknuxster sent ya!<p>
Maybe you already have a Sonic website and have come across this page to link my site to yours. It's cool with me, all you have to do is go to the 'Link to the Stadium' section and you'll find all sorts of banners to plaster on your website. Also if you wish to offer your website as a link in this page go to the Universal Form and tell me your name (or nickname), e-mail address, your site name, and the place of any banners or buttons you may want to put in here to make your link look pretty. ahem...
