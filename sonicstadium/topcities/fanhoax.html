<a name="#guide"><font size=5 color=#00B700>Hoaxes: What you need to know<p></font></a>

<table border=0 width=100% bgcolor=black><tr><td bgcolor=#00509F>

<div align=center><B><font size=2>So, what exactly is a hoax? Well, in the video game community it is basically a video game image, usually a screenshot of a game, that is meant to be percieved as real and achieveable. In actual reality, what you see on the screenshots on these pages are merely sprites from different games carefully placed to make it look real.<p>
Hoaxes can be anything. They can be edited sprites, say, Sonic with a mohican, screenshots of strange events, for example Sonic and Eggman prancing arm in arm around Emerald Hill Zone, hell some can even be animations, each shot describing a particular part of the hoax, like a story.<p>
For your hoaxes to be able to be qualified in SHC, all you need is your own imagination, something in the hoax MUST relate to Sonic, and that's about it.  Anything else is allowed. You can drive a Kirby sprite in your hoax. You can add your own home-made sprites, like a discoball or something. Just make sure your hoax is original, and must be your own idea, unless you have permission to use a certain sprite etc. from the person who made the original hoax. Anything like Super Sonic in Sonic 1 is just not original, so I won't allow it. To get started, here's an example of how to place Knuckles in Sonic 1 (I'm doing this one because it's not original, and I won't allow hoaxes that have been created before: 

<ul>
<li><font color=#ffcc000>First get an emulator (the best one to use is Genecyst). Play through Sonic 1 until you are happy with the background. Go to the menu at the top and click on View, then Layer. In the next menu click on 'Sprites' as you won't be needing Sonic. See how all the sprites - Rings, Sonic, Lives counter - everything in that field disappears, leaving the background. You will want the background first, so press F9 to take a snapshot. The snap will appear in the same folder as Genecyst, so you can access it easily later. 
<li><font color=orange>Next 'Switch the Genecyst off', then load in a ROM of, say, Sonic 2 & Knuckles. Again, when you find an event that you think would look good, say for this example, Knuckles standing still, click on View then Layer, then try clicking on the different layers to take them out, try and get Knuckles on his own a black background. Do not click on 'Sprites' this time - you want a picture of Knuckles, and should you click that, the sprite will also disappear. It doesn't matter if there are still images around Knux, as long as there is nothing immediately surrounding him. Watch out because removing one of the layers make the game go dodgy. If this happens just replace the layer. Take a snapshot when you are ready. Exit Genecyst. 
<li><font color=darkorange>Open the snapshots with any paint designer program, it is best to use one of the Paint Shop Pro Series. Using the selection tool, drag around the whole of the background of the Sonic 1 image, then copy and paste it onto Paint. Then, from the second snapshot, copy Knuckles onto Paint using the same methods. When in Paint, click on the Fill tool, fill the background around Knuckles white, then click on the selection tool and drag around Knuckles, so you can take him across to the Sonic 1 background, which should also be in Paint. Make sure you click on the icon at the bottom of the left hand toolbar so that the white background is clear and not a white box in the background.</ul>

<font size=2 color=white>That's it! Of course, for more advanced stuff, you'll need to change the lives counter etc. But that is more or less the basics. Now you can try it. Give it a go, then try your own ideas, like Roareye's idea with Eggman in the Special Zone. You can go for humour, serious, absolutely anything, if you follow the 'rule' of non-originality and idea-copyright above, then send it in!
