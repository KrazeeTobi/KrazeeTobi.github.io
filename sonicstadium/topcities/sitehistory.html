<div align=center><B>Welcome to the Sonic Stadium's history page. For those that have been with the Stadium from the beginning, this will be a not-so-pleasant trip down memory lane as we re-discover the ugly old looks of the Stadium - yes, there were several new layouts, and basically remember all the stuff that Dreadknux has created since up until this day. Many of you though have only just found out about the wonders of the Sonic Stadium, so this will be a nice little introduction for you about how the Stadium was run before you discovered the new look website. All history will appear in the releavant year - I've divided them into years so that page loading will be quicker, there's quite a few things I've done to keep this place up and running. New History will appear on this page first though, before being archived in the releavant year. Well, without further ado, let's get stuck in, right from the very start.<p>

<font size=2 color=orange>What are your opinions on the old Sonic Stadium layouts? I love hearing from you all! Tell Dreadknux by <a href=mailto:dreadknux@knuckles.co.uk>E-mailing him</a>, even just to say hi or by simply <a href="uniform.html">filling in the Universal Form!</a></font><B><p>

<font size=2><b><div align=center>Many a good thing has happened this month, first off, Sega Sonic Radio has officially become a member of the 'Zone Rado Network, from Emulation Zone no less. Everyone seems to be enjoying voting for their fave Sonic site in the Sonic Site Awards, and as Christmas approaches, so does the final verdict, and the special awards ceremony. I decided to change the look of the Sonic Stadium (yes, again) for the better, after accidently creating a kick ass Sonic and Shadow silhouette background. I made two versions of the Sonic Stadium's main page and asked you 'orrible lot which one you liked best. You guys voted for the double Navigaton bars, which is what its gonna be from now on. I also decided to lay off the speeches, I'll save them for in here from now on. Plus, Neon Chaos, webmaster of Shadow Of A Hedgehog no less, and I have been in talks to create a mock hybrid of both the Stadium and SOAH for the new year. Sound like fun? It sure does, and what's more, if you fans out there love the new team up between us two, the site'll stay up!<p>

<font size=2><b><div align=center>I decided to open a new Topcities account, as if I put the new midis in my current one, there won't be any room left for those quality pages I keep coming up with ;P So that's what I did. I updated with the news, and soon after Topcities deleted my account, along with some other innocents. Why? Only God knows, it seems. Next month, I will sort this thing out, this is getting out of hand. The Stadium has passed 4,000 hits! This must have been the mad rush after I announced (rather late) the second PHASE of the Sonic Site Awards. It wasn't easy - I had to mail all the nominations, make the pages, and invite everyone to a celebratory bash that's imminent at the end of the year. I still have to email TT, as he gave me the wrong site URL, and I don't know his email address, which is handy. The bummer is, he's through to the finals...
