<font size="2"><font color=black>The objective? The classic - Dr. Ivo Robotnik wants the cute little animals to turn into mega metal monster machines. With the help of these machines, Robotnik (or more commonly known as "Eggman") plans to rule all of Mobius. The only problem for Robotnik is that he still needs the seven chaos emeralds. These Chaos emeralds provide awesome power and if Robotnik gets his hands on them, no more Mobius as we know it.</font><p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>Sounds pretty heavy, doesn't it? Well, there is hope considering that the fastest hedgehog alive has vowed to stop Eggman, and collect all of the emeralds before he does. Playing as the one and only Sonic, you must run through six levels, collecting the emeralds of course, to Robotnik's Sky Base and thwart his evil schemes. The question is, can Sonic do it? That depends on how YOU play the game...</font></table><p>

<a name="info1"><table border=0></a><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son1msinfo1.gif" alt="Hey, these fish are weeny! Ha Ha. CHOMP! ow."></table><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>If you haven't caught the concept of Sonic yet, then you have either been living under a rock for the past ten years or you were mentally ill. You play as Sonic the hedgehog (No duh!) and you must run to the end of each act with the aid of the super sonic spin and the vertigo inducing jumps that Sonic can perform. Things get nasty though as each of the six levels gets harder to complete the further you progress.</font>
</table><p><a name="info2"><table border=0></a><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son1msinfo2.gif" align=left alt="Come on sissy boy? What 'r ya gonna do? Run me Over? Mwahaha. That was the last we heard of Sonic the Hedgehog."></table><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>At the end of each zone (that's every three acts to everyone else) You have to face a boss in the form of an overweight
blimp in a hovercraft, Dr. Robotnik. Robotnik comes in a wide variety of guises at the end of every zone, each one harder than the last. You must 
overcome the piglet in his machine by figuring out what his pattern is, and then attacking when he is at his weakest. The final act consists of just
one mega boss, which you have to give quite a pounding to before he is down.</font></table>
<p><a name="info3"><table border=0></a><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son1msinfo3.gif" align=left alt="You realise that these rings spell 'SEGA'? Good innit? Well, you can only see the 'A' but, well."></table><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>Yes, this game can be tough at the worst of times, but all is not lost for Sonic. He can achieve extra continues if he completes a level with
over 50 rings. Then he must enter a special stage filled with bumpers and rings in order to find the Continue monitor, destroy it, and finish the level as normal. If afterwards Sonic has the misfortunate possibility to reach the pearly gates,
you have the chance to use up one of the continues you collected and start the level over again with three lives.</font></table>
<p><a name="info4"><table border=0></a><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son1msinfo4.gif" align=left alt="Look at that. See, easy to get innit? Erm, no." align=right></table><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>As explained above, to truly complete the game, Sonic must find the special chaos emeralds sneakily hidden within each zone. In either act One or Two of each zone, one of 
these treasures is to be found. Naturally, the further you progress throughout the levels, the harder it is to find these precious gems. Collect all six within the six levels - Green Hill Zone, Bridge Zone, Jungle Zone, Labyrinth Zone, Scrap Brain Zone and Sky Base 
and you are treated to a special ending when you complete the game.</font></table>
<p><a name="info5"><table border=0></a><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son1mscompare.gif" align=center alt="Hang on a second, this seems slightly different..."><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son1ggcompare.gif" align=right alt="Hey, that's a bit easier..."></table>
<table border=0 width=80%>
<tr><td><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><b>Similar as they may be, the Master System version of Sonic the Hedgehog differs vastly from the Game Gear version. Aswell as looking partially different, the levels that Sonic has to encounter are more or less simplified versions of the Master System levels.
The boss on the Bridge level, for example, you were situated on three dodgy platforms in the Master System , whereas you were standing between two bridges in the Game Gear counterpart. The second level of Jungle has been shortened on the Game Gear version than on the Master System, where you 
had to jump between three or four logs approx. to get to the finish. Why Sega did this? No clue. My prediction is that maybe because the Game Gear at the time was eating up batteries faster than the blue blur himself, the game was made shorter to give players a chance to actually complete it.
(that doesn't mean its any easier, though...)</table>
