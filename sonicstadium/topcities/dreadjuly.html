<div align=center>
<font size=2 color=#00B700><b><i>Q:</i> Do you know any codes or cheats for Sonic Adventure 2?<br>
<font color=orange>From kouleifohh<br>
<font color=white><i>A:</i> There are as yet no known cheats for SA2, kind of like the original SA before it, but there are certainly secrets to work for. You can get new skins in the 2-player mode. If you get Rank A's on all of Sonic's levels and missions, you'll be able to play as him in a PSO HuMAR Outfit, and as Amy Rose. If you do the same as Shadow, you can play as Metallix or Shadow in a PSO RaMAR outfit. Tails has a different coloured mech and a Chao, Eggman has a red mech and Big the Cat. Knuckles can become Tikal and in another PSO outfit and Rouge can transform into Chaos or she can slip into a kinky little number of hers. Finally, if you get Rank A's on every level and mission (except for Cannon's Core), you can play in a secret level titled only 'Green Hills Zone'. Yes, it is excactly the same as the Mega Drive 1st Act, only in proper 3D and with all the sound effects too. I'm only a doctor, but I'll threaten Dreadknux with a lethal injection so he can get a cheat VMU Save file for you all. How does that sound? Just keep your eyes glued to the Sonic Stadium.</font></table>

<font size=2 color=#00B700><b><i>Q:</i> On Sonic Adventure 1 is it possible to have a Chaos like Chao if so tell me how?<br>
<font color=orange>From tuckercorgimom<br>
<font color=white><i>A:</i> I believe you are referring to those special Light Chao, that look rather uncannily like the bad guy Chaos itself. Well, to grab yourself a Light Chao, go to your nearest Chao Centre as any player. Get any Chao baby to 'de-evolve' back into an egg, or make it reborn twice. To achieve this, first of all your Chao needs to be an adult, so it can mate. You have to be able to access a free VMU and play Chao Adventure also. Play through the Chao game on your VM until you get a Life Nut. Feed your adult Chao a minimum of three Life Nuts, making your Chao mate after you feed it each one. After a while, it should turn into an egg a couple of times. Hatch the egg again. A few tries later and your chao should have turned back into a baby. When this is done go out of the centre and give that Chao 1 of each of the 15 animals you can pick up throughout the levels (Destroying badniks). After that make sure it evolves and when it does, it will become a Light Chaos Chao. I explained this earlier, doesn't anyone listen to me!!!?? Erm, sorry, sanity pills...</font></table>
<p>

<hr width=90%><p><div align=center>
<font size=2 color=#00B700><b><i>Q:</i> I have heard that in Sonic 1, you can do a spin dash. I thought this must be a cheat or something. But I can't find out how to do it. Can you tell me?<br>
<font color=orange>From ???<br>
<font color=white><i>A:</i> Well, you heard right. But you're doing it wrong. You need a Sega Saturn and Sonic Jam. Once these have been prescribed play throughout Sonic 1 on the CD until the game is complete. Select Spin Dash from the menu after that. I thought people would have figured this out by now...</font></table>

<hr width=90%><p><div align=center>
<font size=2 color=#00B700><b><i>Q:</i> I am having a problem getting into the Black Market section on the sonic adventure homepage.It keeps telling me something about a wrong "cookie" and to cheack my Dreamcast clock. What do I do? <br>

P.S. :I'm talking about Chao. 
<br>
<font color=orange>From Morgan<br>
<font color=white><i>A:</i> Ah, it's this old symptom. This means that work on the Black Market must not have been finished, and sadly won't be finished. Unfortunately, it seems most likely that the Sonic Adventure website has closed down. This may explain the errors that you keep getting, it happens often on my browser too. The only thing I can prescribe is Sonic Adventure 2, as this also features the Black Market, although it is not finished yet on the SA2 webpage. Your best bet Morgan is to spend your cash on Sonic Adventure 2. But in all honesty, it's not as if no-one really wanted it... ^_^</font></table>

<hr width=90%><p><div align=center>
<font size=2 color=#00B700><b><i>Q:</i> What's your favourite out of UK or Archie Sonic comics?<br>
<font color=orange>From ???<br>
<font color=white><i>A:</i> Well, there had to be one question, didn't there? To be honest, I haven't read the US Archie comics, I live in the UK, although the fact that I prefer Sonic the Comic (UK) isn't based on bias. I simply feel that there was a lot more to STC than Archie. It seemed to me that Archie comics were just the brill SatAM on paper, hardly original, I like the cartoon better. And no, this doesn't mean I hate Americans, they're wonderful people. There, has that put your mind at rest? Can you sleep now? If not, take one sleeping pill before you go to bed... I said ONE, dammit!</font></table>

<font size=2 color=#00B700><b><i>Q:</i> How do I get a Light Chao?<br>
<font color=orange>From Kouleifohh<br>
<font color=white><i>A:</i> I assume you are referring to the original Sonic Adventure, rather than the recently released Sonic Adventure 2. Well, to grab yourself a Light Chao, go to your nearest Chao Centre as any player. 
Get any Chao baby to 'de-evolve' back into an egg, or make it reborn twice. To achieve this, first of all your Chao needs to be an adult, so it can mate. You have to be able to access a free VMU and play Chao Adventure also. Play through the Chao game on your VM until you get a Life Nut.
