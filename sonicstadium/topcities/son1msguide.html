Don't worry, it's not as hard as it sounds at all. All you need to do is concentrate, you don't want to be bouncing all over the place at breakneck speeds, you'll never get anywhere. Time your bounces, some springs may get you up higher than others, and for a big bonus at the end, collect as many rings as you can along the way.

<font size="2"><font color=black><b>There is a lightning bar that switches on and off that moves between Robonik's booth and the near left side of the screen. There is also a plunger that powers up and shoots a bolt of electricity when Robotnik presses it. Initially the lightning bar will move towards you with lightning and back to Robotnik with no lightning. It is when the bar moves back when you can hit Robotnik and run back to the left side of the screen, which is the safest place to be. At times the plunger will be pressed and a bolt of electricity will home in towards you. The best thing to do is to keepo running to the left of the screen, even if you are already as far left as you can be, and avoid the bolt of electricity as it comes for you. The bolt will disappear out of the screen and won't bother you until Robotnik presses the plunger again. After you have hit Robotnik a sufficient amount of times the lightning bar will move and stop with no lightning. Run and hit Robotnik, but don't run back until the lightning has been switched off as the bar is moving back towards Robotnik. Repeat this until you have to chase Robotnik out of the game.<p>

<font size="2"><font color=black><b>There are three flamethrowers on the floor, Robotnik is safely in a booth, and the bolt of electricity with the plunger is still present from the Master System version. The left flamethower will start first, so you can avoid it and hit Robotnik close up. hen the fire dies, get away as the flamethrower next to Robotnik will start. Remember to avoid the bolts of electricity, using the trick explained in the Master System guide to this boss above. Back to the flamethrowers, while the one next to Robotnik is going, you can still hit him by jumping over the fire. When the the flamethrower dies down, stay on the left side as the centre flamethrower will start. I would not advise hitting Robotnik at this point; its too risky. Once the middle flamethrower stops, the pattern will repeat, so follow the pattern again until Robotnik's booth is destroyed.
