<font size=3><b><a href="#challenge">Click HERE to head straight to the NEW CHALLENGE!</a>
<p>
<font size=2>Welcome to the Sonic World League. This is the place where you show your brute strength at playing Sonic games, and prove your might to the rest of the Sonic gamesplaying world. A new league will appear each month or so, depending on how well the current league is doing.<p>
So what do you do? Well, you look at the League Brief below, this'll tell you what you have to do. Then, collect the necessary Emus and Roms that the Brief specifies. When you fulfil the task, and you think it's good enough for the League, take a snapshot of your current position, and then e-mail the snapshot to Dreadknux. Unfortunately for the League I can only accept entries via e-mail, but snapshots can be EITHER Photo or Emulator Snapshot, unless specified.<p>

</table><br><font size=2 color=white><b>
<hr width=90%><p>
<font size=3 color=#00B700>Entry Requirements:</font><br>
<font size=2>Depending on what it says on the relevant section in your Challenge Brief, you can either take a snapshot of the required evidence via the PC Emulator you are playing, or you can take a photgraph of your TV Set or Game Gear at the relevant position that the Brief is asking for. Make sure however, that you take a photo that actually makes sense, otherwise there's no point in sending it in. Once you have the photograph, scan it into your PC, place it into a .zip file (MAKE THE ZIP FILE A REASONABLE SIZE PLEASE!!!) using Winzip or another Zipping utility. Then send it to Dreadknux, using the e-mail address at the bottom of the page.<p><hr width=90%><p>

<font size=3 color=#00B700>Cheating:</font><br>
<font size=2>Now come on, enough of you know how cheating just makes you a crap Sonic gamesplayer. Sure enough, yours truly, Dreadknux, will be refereeing each league, and just to let you know, I'm not thick as a brick, so don't bother cheating your way to an amazing high-score, and I can also tell if snapshots have been played with to give them the edge. None of this cheating lark will be allowed, and I won't put you up in the league. But to tell the truth TRUE Sonic fans wouldn't cheat their way to glory anyway, so if you do cheat, you're not really a Sonic fan, are you?<p><hr width=90%><p>

<p>
All that cheating crap aside, just try your best and who knows, you may be standing at the top of the League table. Beware though, although you may be at the top one month, someone can easily slip in a higher score, so practice is the best tactic here, even if you've made it to the top.

<div align=center><font size=2>
<font color=darkorange><i><b>Brief:</i></font><b> Since this is the first League Challenge, I've set you a relatively easy task. Just play through <u>the FIRST FOUR ACTS of Sonic 1</u> on the <u>Master System</u> OR <u>Game Gear</u>. </b><i>PLAY UP TO THE END OF BRIDGE ZONE ACT ONE!</i><b> Your task then is to obtain the <u>highest score</u> after the first four acts. Obviously the higher your score, the higher up the League table you go.<br>
<font color=darkorange size=2><i>Entry Requirements:</i><font color=#00B700 size=1><b> A snapshot of your score total at the end of Act 1 of Bridge Zone. You must have BOTH Chaos Emeralds in Green Hill and Bridge Act 1 at the bottom of the score screen to qualify. A photo will also do if you are not playing with an emulator. Just take a photgraph (quickly) of the End of Act 1 Bridge Zone Score Screen on your TV/Game Gear, scan it on your PC, and e-mail it to Dreadknux!<br>
<font color=darkorange size=2><i>Emus/ROMS needed:</i><font size=1 color=red><b> At the ROMS/Emus Page, you'll need Meka, and a copy of Sonic 1 on either Master System or Game Gear. Follow the links to Sonic Roms.Org<br>
<font color=darkorange size=2><i>Tips:</i><font size=1 color=#ffcc00><b> To help gain a meaty high score in each act, try (i) getting a fast time (ii) getting a ton of rings (iii) destroying a bunch of enemies.
