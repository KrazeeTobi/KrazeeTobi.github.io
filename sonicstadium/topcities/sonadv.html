<table border=0><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadv.gif" align=left alt="So, what're you gonna do Tails? I dunno what're you gonna do? Eh, now don't start that again!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><B>The first real Sonic Platform game in about three years (you can't really call Sonic Jam an original game), and the first on the new superpower console, the Sega Dreamcast. Sonic Adventure was released at the same time as the Dreamcast was, and the game went straight to the top of the charts and never moved from that spot for around three-four months.
</font><p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>
After a good long rest from badniks and the like, Sonic chills out in Station Square until a recent riot invites him to face off against a strange enemy made of water. When the creature is defeated, Sonic runs into Tails, who in turn finds a Chaos Emerald on his journey. The duo go to the Mystic Ruins. On the way, they meet Eggman, who introduces the two to 'Chaos', the water monster Sonic fought earlier.<p>
<font color=black>Nabbing the Chaos emerald found by Tails, Eggman feeds the gem to Chaos, who transforms into a bigger creature. According to the stone tablets, Robotnik finds out that every Chaos Emerald given to Chaos makes the monster stronger, and if he absorbs all of the seven emeralds' power, he'll be invincible. What's worse, Chaos plans on working for Eggman, whose plans will end with the destruction of Station Square and the 
building of his own city, 'Robotnikland' (Cheesy name, eh?). Sonic and Tails have a bidding to stop his raving madness, and yet again attempt to foil his evil plans. On the way Sonic and Tails encounter other characters, who each have a place in the story...

<a name="info1"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo1.jpg" alt="No doubts about it. This is the BEST Sonic game to date."></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><font color=black><B><div align=center>Well, Sonic Adventure sees Sonic and Tails once again
travelling to defeat Eggman, but this time the plot is
much worse. If you read the intro above, then you'll
know the basic story. But it doesn't end there. Oh no.
Some of the other four characters Sonic and Tails
encounter on their journey are from games old and past,
but some are new to the Sonic story. The classic
characters that do make an appearance are Sonic, Tails,
Knuckles, Amy (Ah memories of Sonic games past...), Big
the Cat and E-102 Gamma. What's more, aswell as these
six characters making an mere appearance, they also
take part in a piece of the story...
</table><p><a name="info2"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo2.jpg" alt="Run, Sonic, RUN! You can do it, boy!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><font color=black><B><div align=center>Sonic's side of the story is as explained above. Eggman,
Chaos. The more Chaos Emeralds Eggman feeds Chaos,
the more powerful he becomes. With all seven gems
inside him, he'll become 'Perfect Chaos', which is just
that, having all the Emeralds an' all. There are 10 levels
in Sonic's story and mostly involve getting to the end of
the level to collect a Chaos Emerald or to destroy
the capsule with the animals trapped at the end. Items
Sonic can collect that improve his chances of survival
are Light speed shoes, which make you follow a trail of
rings at light speed, a crystal ring, which reduces time
needed to store up power for the Light Speed shoes, and
the Ancient Light, which uses Sonic's Light Speed Dash
move as an attack move. </table>
<p><a name="info3"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo3.jpg" alt="Tails can fly. Note the motorway board in the background. Is Sonic Team just genius at plugging or what? I mean, Tails can fly... "></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><B><div align=center><font color=black>Tails' participation in this massive storyline is that of
Sonic's, only throughout the story Sonic and Tails get
seperated and Tails decides it's time to work on his new
tornado plane so he can find out where Sonic is and help
him! He also runs into a bit of trouble with Robotnik 
when he plans to blow up Station Square. Tails has 5
levels, which is pitiful to Sonic's 10, and most of them
involve going through Sonic's levels and getting to the
end of the level before Sonic does. Add-ons to Tails'
equipment include the Rhythm Badge, which makes Tails
attack rapidly, and sneakers which make him fly faster.</table>
<p><a name="info4"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo4.jpg" alt="Typical Station Square day..."></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><font color=black><B><div align=center>Knuckles' story is totally different from Sonic and
Tails'. It begins on his Floating Island guarding the
Master Emerald, when he spies an intruder. After the
intruder left, Knuckles found that the Master Emerald
was shattered. Pieces had flown across all of Adventure
Field, and as the Master Emerald's protector, Knuckles
vowed to collect all of the missing pieces... Knuckles'
levels are compact versions of the levels that Sonic has
been in, but instead the aim is to search for the pieces,
which appear in random places throughout the levels.
There are three Emerald shards in each level and
Knuckles plays through five levels. He can collect the
Shovel Claw, which enables him to dig through soil, and
Fighting gloves, which gives him a homing attack.</table>
<p><a name="info5"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo5.jpg" alt="Er, Amy, where is your birdy companion? Uh oh. You didn't leave him in the dodgems...did you?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black><B>Amy makes a comeback in this game and now she's got a
new storyline. While Sonic is battling Eggman, Amy is
left reminiscing of the good times she had with Sonic,
until a bird hits her. It seems that the bird is under
suspicion from Eggman to contain a Chaos emerald and is
under pursuit from Eggman's half-witted robot, Zero.
It's Amy's mission to protect the 'birdy' from
Robotnik's robot's clutches. Amy's levels are similar to
Sonic's (get to the end of the level), albeit different
routes from Sonic and you must evade Zero the robot
 and reach the balloon to get away. She has 3 levels and
can obtain weapons which include the Warrior Feather,
which enables Amy to do her Spin Hammer Attack, and
a larger hammer with more attack power.</table>
<p><a name="info6"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo6.jpg" alt="Froggy? Where are you Froggy!? You seen Froggy? 'Get away from me, you fat thing!' Thanks! Froggy?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><font color=black><B><div align=center>Big the Cat is a new addition to the Sonic Team
(geddit?), with his sole mission to get his dear friend
back, a frog curiously called 'Froggy'. Lately Froggy
has grown a strange tail and has been acting weirdly.
One day he runs away from Big and being the lonely
massive cat he is, can't bear to leave him, so he follows
him. The frog really contains a Chaos emerald, which is
the reason for the strange tail, and why Eggman is after
Froggy too. Since Big is so good at fishing, it is this
subject that forms all of his levels, which are a total of
4. They consist of fishing for a certain weight fish and
then for Froggy who is also swimming in the level. There
is a float to be obtained, which makes big float and fish
on water, and many many additions to his fishing rod.</table>
<p><a name="info7"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo7.jpg" alt="Name: E-102 Gamma. Objective: Rescue... friends... E-Series friends... Haha. Yeah, right, I'm gonna help my friends! Hohoho... I mean, E-Series friends..."></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><font color=black><div align=center><B>E-102 Gamma is another new recruit for the Sonic
group and is one of Eggman's robots (you would think
that, wouldn't you? ^_^). First of all he is controlled by
Eggman to retrieve Big's friend, Froggy. Once he does
this, he is ordered to get the birdie off of Amy (yes,
Amy runs into him. Everyone encounters each other at
one point or another). But Amy rebels this idea and
makes Gamma think about his life. He decides that the
rest of his E-Series robots need help (the animals
trapped inside them have a life y'know) and goes against
Eggman's wishes to free the birdies inside the other E-
Series robots. Most of Gamma's levels involve
destroying another E-Series robot at the end of each
level, of which he has 5. Other additions include a Jet
booster which makes him hover, and a better gun.</table>
<p><a name="info8"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo8.jpg" alt="Oh dear. Its, erm, Perfect Chaos. Er, lovely teeth you have there... help..."></table><table border=0 width=80%><B><font size="2"><font color=black><div align=center>In the way of bosses, you get your fair share, although
its not in the traditional Sonic manner, bosses usually
appear after every few cut-scenes and the bosses
consist of Eggman, Chaos in several stages, or mini-
bosses where you fight each other! It's quite groovy
actually, because its a step up from the Hidden Palace
Battle in Sonic and Knuckles. You get to find it almost...
enjoyable. Hearing Knuckles enthusiastically say 'Oh
no.' when he gets hit is particularly funny.</table>
<p><a name="info9"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo9.jpg" alt="Ah, look at the cute little chao... having fun... argh... I suddenly get the urge to... kill!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><font size="2"><font color=black><B><div align=center>One of the genius touches that Sonic Team always seem
to make in their Sonic games, and this one is no
exception. Introducing Sega's answer to Pikachu and the
Tamagotchi - the Chao! Yes, much better creatures I'd
wager. These chao can be found in special gardens in the
Adventure field and you take special care of them by
picking them up and cuddling them and feeding them at
the right time. The animals that are realeased from the
 badniks from the levels you have encountered earlier
 have a use in here. Collect them and they'll appear in
 the corner of your screen. Go to the Chao garden and
 you'll release the animals. Give these animals to the
 Chaos and they will gain special abilities, aswell as
 evolving into a different looking Chao, depending on how
 you treat it and what animals you give it. All Chaos are
 unique because of this. And you can even download them
 onto your VMU and play a game called 'Chao Adventure'
 which raises its status the more you play. Hell, you can
 even upload them onto the Internet, so that other people
 can download it and wonder in awe how you created that
 certain chao. A genius idea and welcome here in the
 Stadium. </table>
<p><a name="info10"><table border=0 width=80%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/sonadvinfo10.jpg" alt="Complete the game as everyone and you get to play as Super Sonic! Yeah! Go!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><B><div align=center><font size="2"><font color=black>The fun doesn't stop with just six characters. Nope.
 Complete the game with all six players and you get
 access to a special story called 'Super Sonic', which
 details the aftermath of Sonic's victory. It seems that
 even though Sonic defeated Eggman, Chaos is still on the
 loose - this time without Robotnik! Chaos has gone
 AMOK and has retrieved all of the seven Chaos
 Emeralds and has turned into Perfect Chaos. Only one
 dude can stop him, and it ain't Sonic. Play as Super
 Sonic to destroy this monster and you'll discover what
 happens afterwards! Play Sonic Adventure. Love Sonic
 Adventure.<br>
