Sonic Crackers was announced for the Sega Mega Drive soon after either Sonic 1 or 2 was released on the console. Before Crackers though this game used to go under the name of 'Sonic Stadium'. ^____^<p>
</font><p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>It featured much of the same capering that you had to deal with on Knuckles Chaotix, which came out later. Chaotix may have been the game that took this games place, as no-one heard a word about it a while after development, and not long after it was realised that the game had been canned for good. But, the ROM is here, and this page will tell you the odds and ends to this limited BETA.<p>
You can download the Sonic Crackers ROM, plus the Emulator needed to play it on the <a href="sonicroms.html"><font color=blue>Sonic ROMS and Emus</a></font> Page.</font></table><p>

<p><h2><font face="comic sans ms" color=green>*In Depth Information*</h2></font>

<a name="info1"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo1.gif" alt="Wheeeeeeeee....... arrrrrrghhhhhhhhh!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>The first thing this BETA reminds you of is Knuckles Chaotix, even though this was meant to be released before it. The first player controls Sonic, and you are holding a ring with Tails linked to another ring. Either the computer or a friend can control Tails, but this BETA is best played together, the computer is especially dumb. Your goal is to reach the end of the level before the time limit kills you. Well, not really kills you, more like crashes your Genecyst. Don't worry, just hit Reset, it's not a harsh crash.</font>
</table><p><a name="info2"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo2.gif" alt="*Sonic Adventure Eggman voice* Tails! Wait for me!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>At least you might have been able to reach the end in the time limit, but as soon as you reach the end, by cheating or otherwise, the BETA, again, crashes your ROM. Lovely. This game is really only for sightseeing, not for playing as such. Much is the emphasised to the point that there are only two potential levels. Yes, the screenshot above and the one before it are the only two level you can access, and you can only access the second level via the 'Select' option on the title screen.</font></table>

<p><a name="info3"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo3.gif" alt="Ah, I love you Tails! Give us a hug!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>
Playing the levels can be a tricky business, unless you're playing the second level, of course. If you're trying the second level, it's an impossible business. You have to get through the level with teamwork and co-operation, and with the computer in mind, you're better off with a chum as Tails. You can run with your partner along the screen, but when it comes to disagreements, the springy coil that connects the two rings together will bounce you around like a lemon being bounced around. You can also grab your friend and throw them up onto ledges, so that they can help you up using the coil.
</font></table>
<p><a name="info4"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo4.gif" alt="Arh! The yellow box of doom is after us! It's gonna squash us. Nargh!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>
If you think the computer is being a little bit nobbish, or if you either want to look around the level, struggle for survival or just cheat to get to the end, just pause the screen whatever you're doing, and you can re-position your characters anywhere on the level. Of course, it won't do much good trying to cheat to the end, for reasons explained above. The time stops aswell, so you don't have to worry about sightseeing one minute and the ROM crashing the next.

<p><a name="info7"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo5.gif" alt="Erm, excuse me, what the hell are you?"><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo6.gif" alt="Erm, excuse me, what the hell are you?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>Go to the 'Select' screen, and you'll find that levels are set in Attractions and Fields. Attractions are the main levels, whereas if you select the 'Field' option on any world, you'll be taken to a screen like the ones above. There's no point in it, Sega probably added this in as a level select, moving from level to level like in an RPG. There's only two of these Fields mind, both shown in the screenshots up there.</font></table>
<p><a name="info7"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo7.gif" alt="Erm, excuse me, what the hell are you?"><img src="pics/Screenshots/soncrackinfo8.gif" alt="Erm, excuse me, what the hell are you?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>The 'Select' screen looks pretty bland, but option screens don't make up gameplay, do they, so I should shut up about that for a start. There are many worlds to choose from, each with a field (but only two of them), and five Attractions. Only some of the Attractions are actually playable past the title cards, they crash or screw up in some way. If you do get past the title cards of death, then all you'll find are the same two levels explained earlier on the page, but with different colour schemes. Doesn't seem so interesting now, does it? If you fancy an unplayable, ring-bouncy (I don't know -_-) laugh, then check this out.</font></table>
