<font size=4 color=#00B700><b><div align=center><font color=red>NEW:</font> Super Sonic Fan #1's Game- New details!</font><br>
<font size=1 color=red>18 October 2001</font><p>
<font size=2><b>Super Sonic Fan #1 has truly taken a shine to games developing, as his first and most ambitious Fan Game proves. Here's the info from the e-mail straight from SSF#1:<p>
<i>"...First of all, it will be in full 3d, just like the 2 sonic 
adventure's, second, unlike the Dreamcast games, you will be able to play as supersonic in any of sonic's levels, I am also adding a new secret character to the mix, Ultrasonic, I won't get into details about him yet. Tails and Knuckles will be there as secret characters, the whole plot is simple, eggman has rebuilt the deathegg and its up to you to stop him, again. I will send you a demo when the first level is completed.The fight to get the chaos emeralds involves you racing against shadow to get more rings,(I know what happened to shadow in the end of SA2)...The first level will be a beach, just to let you know. Sonic will have all of his abilities from SA2, and his transformation to supersonic will be DBZ style, which I think will be cool, there will even be a 3D Flying battery zone if SEGA allows it." <p>

</i><p>
SSF#1's hopes are high, and so are mine - we may have a 3D Fan Game war on our hands. Since Sonic Team Junior's taking their time with their game, plus it's sprite rendered, making headaches liable (to me anyway), SSF#1 is opting for proper 3D meshes and the like. BUT WAIT! There's more from the big S:<p>
<i>"I'm sorry, but since I have yet to get past character development, I can't get any screenshots at this time, but I have got level designs on paper for levels 1-3. I'll tell ya, level three is MASSIVE! There is like, 70 robots throughout level 3. Hidden palace won't be too bad graphically, but it might be too easy. This will probably be the 
second 3d fangame out there. Mine might be better than Srb2, because my game will have camera rotation, as well as a homing attack."</i><p>

Meow! Catfight! ^_^ 'Better than SRB2' eh? Let's just hope so - maybe it sounds like it'll be on a par with SA! Plus, Demos will be going out to Sonic HQ, BUT stick with the Sonic Stadium, as Dreadknux will be getting his grubby mitts on a SPECIAL EDITION DEMO, including a first person view and the like, exclusive ONLY to this site! Wow indeed. More news as I get it.

<font size=1 color=red>6 October 2001</font><p>
<font size=2><b>After announcing that a text adventure of the Moogle Caverners' top online story - The Battle Of Cowkey - Dreadknux has canned the text adventure totally. BUT, don't worry, the text adventure idea has been replaced by an online comic. Because sifting through text is hardly an idea of a riveting adventure, I've decided to let sprites and backdrops do the talking. An idea I had a while ago was to be putting up a poll to determine where the Mooglers wish to go next, kind of the idea that H Hog had used in Mayneeyah before me. I'm in talks with H Hog about the idea now. So, expect a better adventure than before.

<font size=2><b>Freindly online guy, and Dreadknux's best online buddy H Hog, has made a winner. Online comics don't come close to this - Enter Mayneeyah, an online comic with a difference. Resembling characters from many an RPG such as Earthbound, Final Fantasy, and (YES!) Shining Force II [H Hog and I are both great SF2 lovers!], readers choose a path in which the story goes, using a poll at intervals to the story. Ingenious idea, and got to make the idea before Dread (see above). <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011113000000/http://www.fpforums.net/~hhog/mayneeyah.html" target=_blank>Have a look at Mayneeyah!</a>

<font size=1 color=red>6 October 2001</font><p>
<font size=2><b>BIG fan of the Sonic Stadium, SuperSonicFan #1 has released details of his new Sonic Fan Game. He has explained that it will be in 3D, much like Sonic Robo Blast 2, in development also (and for a very long time). At the moment, you can only play as Sonic the Hedgehog, and a provisional release date has been pencilled in for Christmas 2002, but SSF#1 doubts that he can meet that deadline, so expect it to change in the future. Obviously, being a Super Sonic Fan, the gold alter-ego is as much a fully fledged character in the game as Sonic himself. Hopefully, expect the game to be showcased at SAGE soon (depending on the progress)

No actual announcement from Roareye yet about the game, but it is said that the Fan Game is based more around the characters that he has created, himself, dragons called Karldes and Robtres, and other fictional characters. Voice Tests has already begun for the characters in the Moogle Cavern Message Board, with Insiders suggesting that Jamina Swiftrunner is in with a chance of making it into the final cast. More news as Roareye, or anybody else involved, gets in touch with Dread.</table>

<font size=1 color=red>20 September 2001</font><p>
<font size=2><b>H Hog has recently (well, a while ago, gimme a break here ^_^) stated that he may be considering canning the Final Fantasy NES Hack that he was planning, starring Moogle Caverners the like of Tenniru, Kulock, and Dreadknux to name a few. Instead he may be thinking about changing his game hack from Final Fantasy to Earthbound, the great SNES game. Places for the game have already been taken, and whether H can find the time to do that or finish the Final Fantasy will be anyone's guess. Hopefully, whatever H Hog's churns out with, MC fans will not be disappointed.

Obviously, the text adventure is to feature a lot more than just the basic plot, I am already adding little touches like City Banks to visit, Casinopolis Zones and much more... when I can think of any. :) I dunno when the Adventure will be finished, I will keep you posted right here...

<font size=2><b>Fellow webmaster and official affiliate H Hog, the brains behind the excellent Sonanoid and Hoax submitter, is in the process of making a ROM Hack for the popular NES game, Final Fantasy. Instead of the usual characters, the people involved are in fact, members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/20011113000000/http://www.mooglecavern.com">Moogle Cavern</a>, another affiliate of the Sonic Stadium. The demo version of the hack has been played, and it features Kulock, H Hog, Showoff Boy, Crazy Mr Leo (or CraZee Boy as he is now known) and Avolin as the enemy at this stage. H Hog has stated that Dreadknux (me ^_^) will even feature as a final level boss. Now that I can't wait to see. Roll on the hack H!
