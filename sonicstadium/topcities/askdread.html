<font size=2><b>Hello all and welcome to my little shack of questions, the virtual building of troubled queries, the big sea of... erm... damn, need another word for questions. Forgotten. Never mind. Anyway, I had to take a little leave for a while, as blatantly Dreadknux is promising big things for my clinic, but he hasn't even done a bit, so I left for a while, and NOW it's all done. Just bides his time. Just because it's the Stadium's 1st Birthday doesn't mean to say he can abandon his values. Honestly, that Dreadknux can really get on my nerves... Oh, and from what I hear, many of you have taken a fancy to calling me Dr. Dre. Why? It's insulting enough to even share half of a rappers last name (allegedly), but to be called a rap star is even... wait, I CAN be a rap star! Screw doctoring... oh, erm, yay, doctoring is the best... I can see no gun pointing at my head... ow.<br>

<i>A:</i>Unfortunately Niko, PSO is designed for play on only your Sega Dreamcast. The access codes are there simply to register you for the online part of PSO, so whatever you do, you must register on your own DC and not someone else's, otherwise you're in trouble when you play online. Not too certain if you really need the access code to play the offline game, I'm pretty sure you don't, but the whole point is the online bit, so unless you play PSO online, you can register both machines with the same code, provided someone else doesn't have the game either to register with. Otherwise, you can't. So the code is there for online play and for registering the game as yours. Sorry.

<i>A:</i>As Knuckles runs off to the distance, Dr. Dread consults you with an answer... <p>
Ugh, Knuckles can't even come round for a chat now can he without being asked questions? The Cheek!... *SLAP* Ow. Anyway... Your questions about my good friend, Knuckles the Echdina. About the battling thing on Sonic & Knuckles, I suppose it would have been better that way - to be quite honest, the whole storyline doesn't make much sense if you put the two storylines together like in Sonic Adventure. But maybe it's set out so that the two stories don't collide - either the story goes as Sonic or as Knuckles. Although why Knuckles probably doesn't want to fight Sonic in the Hidden Palace Zone at that time is either because at that moment Sonic is fighting Eggman in Lava Reef Act 2, or fear of Sonic beating him or something? Or maybe Knuckles thought that Sonic was in Sky Sanctuary, so he headed there only to find Metallix, that idea sounds more likely. <p>
Oh and for your last question - Knuckles and Julie-Su's daughter is called Lara-Su. Had the family over for Sunday tea the other weekend. Although don't tell Knuckles this, but his daughter isn't half loud...

<font size=3 color=orange><b><i>Q:</i> who makes better game graphics. Sega or Nintendo?
<br>
<font color=#00B700>From Ginger :)
<tr><td bgcolor=#00509F><div align=center><b>
<font size=2 color=white>
<i>A:</i>Well, looking at the two company's history in videogames, I would have to say that Nintendo would produce the better graphics out of the two companies, but only seeings as the NES and SNES were more powerful than Sega's Master System and Mega Drive respectively. But it should be noted Nintendo's attention to detail is apparent in all their games.<p>
Sega on the other hand, they were originally an Arcade company, dishing out arcade games by the truckload, even today, Sega's unrivalled in this area. Pushing the boundaries all the time, Sega's graphics are unrivalled naturally, being on an arcade machine and all. But the home consoles that Sega would churn out, no matter how popular, was capable of outstanding graphics, but not at the pace that Sega are advancing at the moment, therefore most games are either arcade style games or ports, and the conversion is slightly poor on the graphics side, compared to the arcade originals. Outrun on the Mega Drive, anyone? Nevertheless, Sega still bring massive attention to detail also, for example Crazy Taxi.<p>
I'm not going to do a 'Find out for yourself which is the better two' - because that will be unprofessional ['Any more than you are now?' - Dread] But, my honest opinion would be that Nintendo, being solely a home console company, pay more attention to the graphics on most of their games on their consoles, whereas comparing to the arcades (which I know is a bit unfair but still...) Sega come out on top. Sega are getting better though, and their in house development teams that make pure home console titles (Eg. Sonic ^_^) are at a match between the graphics side, but the majority of Sega's home console titles aren't as attentive as Nintendo's.
