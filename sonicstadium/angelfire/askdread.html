<font size=2 color=black><b>Welcome to Ask Dr. Dre(ad), and you are now within my clinic. I am of course, Dr. Dread, you can call me Dr. Dre if you like, but I'm a doctor, not a rap star. Let's just get that sorted. Hmmm? Why am I here? Because of you. Yes, you. I know that sometime in the not too distant future that you will have at least one question about Sonic the Hedgehog, just itching to ask someone, but then you can't be bothered and this leads to trauma, and constant head injuries involving a spade. Beleive me, in my experience, it has happened.</table><br>
<div align=center><font color=black><b>
And it may happen to you too, should you not ask anyone just a teeny tiny little Sonic question. And this could be anything. Maybe you wish to complete a level but are having difficulty. You might want to know a bit of Sonic's background story, or what's up with the Sonic cartoons such as Sonic Underground. You may even be wanting to find out the best bargains for online Sonic goods. You see, it doesn't matter if it's a silly question or not, as long as it has some relevance to a query about Sonic. Of course, if your questions are silly, I may have to prescribe a little bit of nerve tablets for the head, as something clearly may not be right up there.<br>
Nonetheless, a question about Sonic. From any aspect of Sonic, from video games to background knowledge. You'll suffer supreme mental illness if you don't confront someone with all this, and this person is me, Dr. Dread. Now, I hope this conversation between us has introduced my practice, and should you have a question, ask me either via e-mail or via the Universal Form. I look forward to seeing you again in my Doctor's offices. <br>
<font color=red>*Dr. Dre(ad)*</font></table>
<p><font color=black><b>Well, I think I'll show you the FIRST ever question posed to me. I'll admit, not when Dr. Dread had moved into the Stadium, this was a while ago, but just to get the ball rolling, here is the first question ever!<br>
<h3><font color=orange face="Comic Sans MS">And now for the first official Dr. Dre(ad) query EVER!</h3></font>
<font color=#ffc000><i>Q:</i> Do you have a Game Gear?</font><br>
<font color=green><i>A:</i> Yes. Yes I do. Yes, honest to God, this was a genuine<br> question to me in an e-mail I had one day.</font><p>Well, that was the FIRST EVER question bestowed upon me, Dr. Dread. If you have any more, slightly more significant Sonic questions, ask me via e-mail or via the Universal Form. I'm going to have my tea break.</font>
