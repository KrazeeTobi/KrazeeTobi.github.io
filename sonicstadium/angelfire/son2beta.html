<table border=0><tr><td><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmd.gif" alt="This was the shot that started it all off."></table><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td><font size="2"><b><div align=center><font color=black>This was the screenshot that started the whole conspiracy. Found in the Official Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Guidebook for the Sega Mega Drive, the booklet featured whole black and white maps to all the levels and included every cheat possible.</font> <p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>Of course, there was one little thing that no-one could quite figure out. In the middle of the booklet was a small colour section, and it was titled "Sonic the Hedgehog 2: The Lost Levels". The section featured screenshots of Dust Hill, Hidden Palace Zone upon many other canned Sonic 2 levels. This screenshot of the alternate title screen, with the alternate level select, was among these screenshots.</font><p>
<font size="2"><font color=black>About 1998 though, a Sonic ROM investigator called Simon Wai searched through Sonic 2 ROMS, cartridges, anything that could solve the mystery of the Lost Levels. Thankfully, Sonic Team had kept most of the canned levels and sprites in the ROMS and cartridges, to save time releasing the final version, as it was taking so long to release in the first place. It was at this time that Wai had discovered the left over missing pieces that was hidden in the cartridge and compiled them into a ROM for the Sonic gamesplaying public to play and test. It is on this page that Dreadknux will take you through the Sonic 2 BETA ROM, level by level.<p>
You can download the Sonic 2 BETA ROM, plus the Emulator needed to play it on the <a href="sonicroms.html"><font color=blue>Sonic ROMS and Emus</a></font> Page.</font></table><p>

<p><h2><font face="comic sans ms" color=green>*In Depth Information*</h2></font>

<a name="info1"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo1.gif" alt="Metropolis strangely, is only the third level you get to."></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>Well, thanks to Simon Wai, we can see what little secrets have been kept from us in the BETA version of Sonic 2. Well, to start off, when you play it initially, there are four Zones to play, but using the level select <font color=darkorange>*At the title screen hold 'A' and press START*</font>, we can get access to much more levels, as seen in the level select screenshot. Many of these however, have no sprites and backgrounds etc. So its basically a big black screen with Sonic in it. There is one level that has been canned, yet most of its sprites and backgrounds have been kept in... Metropolis is the 3rd Zone you encounter.</font>
</table><p><a name="info2"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo2.gif" alt="What the hell is this all about?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>Oddly, Aquatic Ruins is the first level you come across, and, as in the two zones after it, there are absolutely no enemies in the zones. In Aquatic Ruins there are several places where there's no floor. One example is the beginning of the 2nd Act, with the swinging platforms (remember that?). Well, if you fall into the water, you're as good as had it, mate.</font></table>

<p><a name="info3"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo3.gif" alt="??? The last level boss? Ha ha... Tails!"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>
The next level after Aquatic ruins is Casino Night, which isn't much different from the release version except for the flooring and sprites. The most strange is that the only boss in the entire BETA is the first one! And he appears... In the last level! Yes, the first level, Emerald Hill, is now the last level in this case. Bizarre that. AND, playing the 'game' is frustrating at times as, yes you guessed it from the screenshot, Tails can LOSE you rings. Instead of cheerily bumping into enemies and just getting off lightly, his foolishness punishes you by losing all your rings.
</font></table>
<p><a name="info4"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo4.gif" alt="Don't start son, I was boxing champion in my day..."></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>The canned level which you can freely play in Sonic 2 BETA is the Hidden Palace Zone. This level is only accessible via the level select, explained above. This level is very special to all Sonic fans, because this level has been the most talked about Sonic level ever on any game, and finally you can play this fantastic level.</table>
<p><a name="info5"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo5.gif" alt="Now, then... What the hell is this all about? EH?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>An interesting aspect of this level is explained in this little screenshot here. Clearly you are playing as Sonic, but it's a Tails Life icon. Could this mean that the Hidden Palace was a level only meant for Tails? Or maybe there's a much better explanation of it all. Also, you can find the Master emerald in the Hidden Palace Zone. So, what were Sonic Team thinking at this stage? Obviously they had the Master Emerald plan set up ages before Sonic 3, but maybe they held the idea back for a better storyline to link it with. Enter Knuckles...</font></table>
<p><a name="info6"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo6.gif" alt="Hello Mr. Bat. Look at me! I can walk on air! I'm a god! Heheheh..."></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>Everything is in this level, backdrops, cool effects, rings, even enemies can be found in here. In fact, the only part of the level that hasn't been completed was the very last part, a slope right at what seems to be the very end of the level. This kinda makes you wonder why Sonic Team would go out all their way to make a whole act, then at the very last part just scrap it and leave it in the cartridge. Curious....</font></table>
<p><a name="info7"><table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><div align=center><img src="pics/Screenshots/son2bmdinfo7.gif" alt="Erm, excuse me, what the hell are you?"></table><table border=0 width=80%><div align=center><b><font size="2"><font color=black>The last level when you play this through is the first level in the release version. Yes, Emerald Hill is the final Zone you come across in this ROM, and it may have been well placed at the end at the time, there are enemies unlike those seen in sonic 2 release version, and whenever you're about to hit the spikes, you feel glad that you have rings to protect you. Then a split second later, you hear Tails lose rings nearby, then YOU hit the danger and die from it. Typical.</font></table>
