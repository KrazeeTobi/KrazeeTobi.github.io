There you see Knuckles and Robotnik lying down after Chaos' return. After this clip, do a soft reset by pressing A+B+X+Y+Start.
Now choose Knuckles as your character. Go to the island, and you'll be able to see a double of Knuckles! This works with other characters aswell.</font></table>

<table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><font size="2"><font color=black><b><div align=center>When playing as either Tails or Knuckles, go to Station Square and find the 'Speed Highway' building, but DON'T GO IN IT. Instead, walk to the left of it to find a patch of grass. This will have a card spinning on the grass. Pick it up and take it to the Twinkle Park tower. Whereas you could not get in before, the tower will give you access. 
Still carrying the card, take it inside Twinkle Park towers and bring it up to the Twinkle Circuit door. the door will open, allowing you to ride the circuit as Tails or Knuckles.</font></table>

<h2><a name="shards"><font face="comic sans ms" color=green><a name="intro">*1 Minute Emerald Shards*</a></h2></font>
<table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><font size="2"><font color=black><b><div align=center>If you are finding it difficult to collect all three emblems in a level within the 1 minute time limit, here's what you do. Start a level as normal and take your time finding the first Emerald piece, but whatever you do DON'T COLLECT IT! Restart the level instead and race as fast as you can to that Emerald piece. When you collect an emerald piece, it acts as a save place when you die or restart, which is just what you need. when you've collected the first shard in a decent time, take your time finding the second piece, and repeat the process until you have gained all three pieces!</font></table>

<table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><font size="2"><font color=black><b><div align=center>While playing as Tails, find a patch of grass with weeds sticking out of it. Attack the weeds with your tails, and rings and even 1-Ups may appear. Alternatively, when you have found your Rhythm Badge in Tikal's Echidna Tribe, attack the circles on the floor for the same effect.<p>
Alternatively, if you are playing as Knuckles, when you have found the Shovel Claw, look for any kind of soil that you can dig into and dig there. You may find some rings, but if you can't dig where you are, Knuckles will wittingly say "It's no use!", so if you are in that situation don't bother digging. A good place to dig is in the place where you got your shovel claw, as you can uncover lots of rings and power ups of all kinds, even invincibility!</font></table>

In Ice Cap Zone, at the final stage (the snowboarding section), before you enter and see the avalanche, press X to gain Sonic's famous blue Snowboard (Sonic 3, Sonic Triple Trouble). Alternatively, press B to gain a new yellow Snowboard. <p>
<font size=3 face="comic sans ms" color=red><b><u>Gain more speed as Sonic!</u></B></font><br>Finding it difficult to get some of the Sonic time attack emblems? Then just use this simple trick. While running through a level, keep repeatedly pressing X or B to constantly do the Spin Dash, which in effect should make you go a lot faster and beat most time trials.<p>
<font size=3 face="comic sans ms" color=red><b><u>Play as Super Sonic!</u></B></font><br>If you manage to complete the whole game with all six characters, a new seventh character will appear in the character select screen, called Super Sonic.

<table border=0 width=90%></a><tr><td><font size="2"><font color=black><b><div align=center>At any point in your adventure, go to Station Square and go to the place where you fought Chaos 0 at the start. Look around the area until you find what looks like a Chao egg. Don't be fooled - it's a rock. But you can get a Golden Chao egg out of it! Pick up this rock and take it to the shop where you came out of after you have collected the Light Speed Shoes as Sonic. Go to the end of this shop and you'll find a podium with a Gold egg on it. Beforehand, if you picked up the egg, the alarm will sound and you'll have to put it back. Not the case this time - put down the rock and pick up the Gold egg. Again, the alarm will sound and you cannot get out. But once you have picked up the egg take it away from the podium and put the rock in its place. The alarm will be called off and you'll be free. Take this egg to a local Chao centre and hatch it for a wicked Gold Chao!</font></table>

After the cut scene, press the switch down outside the cage containing the egg to open it. Pick up the egg and take it to the nearest Chao sanctuary (on the Egg Carrier - the door with the buttons ouside. To get in press the buttons in order so that they spell 'Eggman'). Hatch it and a metallic Chao baby will pop out. You can collect this egg as any character, but its easier to get it as either Amy or Gamma.</font></table>

Oh I made it up!) back into an egg, or make it reborn twice. Hatch the egg again. When it does hatch go out of the centre and give that Chao 1 of each of the 15 animals you can pick up throughout the levels (Destroying badniks). After that make sure it evolves and when it does, it will become a Light Chaos Chao.</font></table>

Make sure you have a controller and amemory card plugged into socket D when you turn the Dreamcast on. after a while, a secret 'Chao Puzzle' game will appear on your VMU, where you use your controller to move tiles on a screen to create a picture. Unfortunately, this cannot be downloaded onto your VMU.<p>
<font size=3 face="comic sans ms" color=red><b><u>5 More Sonic Emblems</u></B></font><br>Having trouble finding all 130 emblems? Don't worry, you can get an extra 5 just by raising your chao baby just right. Train it so it can go very fast and then enter it for a race. Choose the tournament mode and choose your fast Chao. Win the four races and you gat four emblems. Once you have won all four courses a fifth one appears. Win this course
and you'll gain your fifth emblem.<p>
