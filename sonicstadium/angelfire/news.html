<font size=2 color=black><b>No, this is not a blatant lie, there is very heavy rumour that Sega and Nintendo are indeed in working on a game, but, and get this! This will be a game to be remembered in history, as this will be a title that'll bring Sonic. And! Mario! Together, in the same game, for the very first time! According to the latest issue of the UK 'N64' magazine by Future Publishing, the news sounded pretty much like it was no rumour, so if this is true, it will bring a tear to many feuding Nintendo/Sega fans of old. Truly remarkable news. Sonic and Mario, joining forces it seems, the thought of it is just... wow! And I mean WOW!

<font size=2 color=black><b>Flipping through recent Nintendo mags and other sources cough up more screenshots of SA Advance for the great Game Boy Advance. You can check them out in the <a href="sonadvance.html"><font color=blue>preview of Sonic Advance</a></font> on this site. Looking at the other, most important Sonic release this year on Dreamcast, Sonic Adventure 2 is near completion (so very near completion) and looking the bomb! Nearly out, fans, don't fret...

<font size=1 color=red>15 June 2001</font><p>
<font size=2 color=black><b>Remember me telling you about an RPG that Sega and Nintendo were rumoured on working on together? Well, a recent inerview of Yuji Naka himself claims that the rumours were indeed just mere speculation, and Sega and Nintendo are currently not making a game together. Naka-san also went on to say he respected Shigeru Miyamoto, (in my eye the second most greatest video games developer ever, next to Yuji the man!), and that Shigsy was a great mind in gaming, or something like that. How nice of him...

<font size=4 color=green><b><div align=center>Stick with Ninty for Sonic Team! Confused?</font><br>
<font size=1 color=red>12 June 2001</font><p>
<font size=2 color=black><b>Probably. But those of you that have a Sega Dreamcast, like me, you'll be thinking about what console to get next. Seeings as Sega are currently not making any more consoles, the sensible option would be to grab the machine that has the most Sega support going for it. Well, at this stage it's hard to tell, but in a recent interview led by <a href="http://www.igndc.com" target=_blank><font color=blue>IGN</a></font>, Yuji Naka, Sonic Team boss and God in many people's eyes, has said to stick with the Nintendo GameCube should you be a full on fan of Sonic Team. Still a while before the Dreamcast kicks it, and with the different Sega departments making sequels and games that are console specific (SmileBit are currently developing Jet Set Radio Future, but only for X-Box), things may change from now and in the future. But for now, if you savour that Sonic Team flavour, bag a GameCube when your DC runs outta life.

<font size=1 color=red>01 June 2001</font><p>
<font size=2 color=black><b>In a recent article in the UK edition of Nintendo Official Magazine, Sega and Nintendo are both working together on a top secret RPG for Ninty's new knight in shining armour, the GameCube. Top this off with as yet unannounced Sega games to be protruding its way onto GC and the GB Advance games, it seems that Sega have already landed on their feet running in third party development. Beware Electronic Arts!
