<h1 align="center"><i>2017</i></h1>
<p align="center">It all starts in May 2017. KrazeeTobi had just came up with his name (thanks to a friend of his) and is a semi-active player in the SRB2 scene. In around October, he would post the first video that would eventually become a distant relative to SRB20YA.</p>
<h1 align="center"><i>2018</i></h1>
<p align="center">Tobi had shaped up the world when he made the first widely-known SRB2 Christmas 0.92-0.94 videos, one of which showcasing what Greenflower 1 looked like in Christmas 0.93. The rest of the year went without much change. That wouldn't last much longer. In August/September 2018, bad news arrived, and Tobi became partially-blind. Determined than ever, he made sure to keep his eye peeled for any new revelation.</p>
<h1 align="center"><i>2019</i></h1>
<p align="center">2019 went uneventfully. At least as uneventfully as it could be. Tobi was thinking about things, and decided to start something after a fellow named SteleCat made a series called "Minecraft 10 Years Ago". Tobi had loved the idea and wanted to apply it to SRB2, but didn't think much people would bother with it. He had initially named the series "Sonic Robo Blast 2 Decades Ago", but thought it didn't sound right. The first video that was published originally had this name, and was the only version to use that name. A site was also worked on, it was a start.</p>
<h1 align="center"><i>2020</i></h1>
<p align="center">2020 rolled around and started alright. Just kidding. Problems with 000webhost and it's stingy no-EXE and 300MB rules made Tobi switch from it to NeoCities on May 15th. The site went live for good and hasn't stopped growing since. In December, SSNTails had joined the community, a milestone once thought impossible. He would be even more surprised in the next 2 months.</p>
<h1 align="center"><i>2021</i></h1>
<p align="center">The present year. Tobi is still hard at work, preparing the new site to open in June 2023. That is something for another day though.</p>
