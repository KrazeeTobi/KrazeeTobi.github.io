<h1 align="center">Joke Videos I made</h1>
<p align="center">Joke videos I have made (or seen, in the case of top 10 not fat foxes) through 2020 (nothing was funny about 2020).</p>
<p align="center"><a href=Penguins-of-Madagascar-FULL-MOVIE-2020.mp4>Early version of a joke video I made. I fucking hate the Persona series, I'm afraid.</a></p>
<p align="center"><a href=Penguins-of-Madagascar-WATCHFREECARTOONS-FULL-MOVIE-2020.mp4>The version I actually played, when we planned to watch the entirety of the Penguins in Madagascar movie. It happened, but not before I pissed myself laughing.</a></p>
<p align="center"><a href=zen.mp4>"top 10 not fat foxes"</a> The video that began the Top Ten Tailses series. Was made by <a href=https://twitter.com/AgentZennifer>Zen.</a></p>
<p align="center"><a href=TopTenTailses1.7z>Top Ten Tailses 1 production materials. This actually came about after the video above was sent to me.</a></p>
<p align="center"><a href=TopTenTailses2.7z>Top Ten Tailses 2 production materials.</a></p>
<p align="center"><a href=TopSixNuclids.7z>Top Six Nuclids production materials. This was made during a Discord call with RadiantNexus team members. It was fucking hilarious seeing the suggestions.</a></p>
