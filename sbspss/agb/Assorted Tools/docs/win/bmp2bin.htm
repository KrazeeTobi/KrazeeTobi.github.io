		<h2>bmp2bin<font size="3"> [Tool Command]</font></h2>
		<p><font color="red">Turns bitmaps into binary.</font></p>
		<h3>Syntax</h3>
		<pre><code>bmp2bin [-b/-p/-w/-h] input-file input-file ...</code></pre>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Converts bitmaps into binary and outputs the results.<br>
		Several things can be done with this tool: (1) the palette can be converted into binary and output, (2) the bitmap can be partitioned according to the size specifications and then divided and output in units of 8x8-dots so it can be used as object data, (3) 24bit images can be converted into binary and output in the color format for AGB, and (4) 8bit images can be output as-is for use in bitmap mode.</p>
		<p>The command arguments are described below:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>input-file </b>
			<dd>The input bitmap file. One binary file is output for every bitmap entered.
			<dt><b>-b </b>
			<dd>Outputs in bitmap mode. If this argument is not specified, then 4bit and 8bit bitmaps will be output as objects (8x8 dots output as 1 character). For 24bit bitmaps the argument is set automatically.
			<dt><b>-p </b>
			<dd>Outputs the palette in binary. The image is not output. If an image without a palette is input an error will occur.
			<dt><b>-w width </b>
			<dd>The per-unit width of objects that are output. Can be specified as 8, 16, 32 or 64. If no value is specified it is set to 8 as the default. Invalid if the -b argument has been specified.
			<dt><b>-h height </b>
			<dd>The per-unit height of objects that are output. Can be specified as 8, 16, 32 or 64. If no value is specified it is set to 8 as the default. Invalid if the -b argument has been specified.
		</dl>
		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p>Supports the 4bit, 4bit RLE-compressed, 8bit, 8bit RLE-compressed and 24bit image formats. 4bit images cannot be output as bitmaps. The output filename is set automatically using the base name of the input file and the appropriate extension. For palette output, the filename is given the <tt>.plb</tt> extension. For all other output, the name ends with the <tt>.imb</tt> extension. For object output, the <tt>-w</tt> and <tt>-h</tt> arguments are valid, and the image is first partitioned into parts of that size and then (to the AGB specifications) divided into 8x8 dots for output. Depending on <tt>-w</tt> <tt>-h</tt> the fractional part of the image will be enlarged.
