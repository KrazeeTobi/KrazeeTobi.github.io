		<h2>bin2h <font size="3">[Tool Command]</font></h2>
		<p><font color="red">Outputs to a C header file the array names generated when binary files are linked.</font>
		<h3>Syntax</h3>
		<pre>bin2h -o output-file filename filename ...</pre>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>When binary files are made into an object file using &quot;objcopy,&quot; special variable names are attached. This tool collects those names and outputs them to a header file.
		<p>The command arguments are described below:
		<dl>
			<dt><b>-o output-file</b>
			<dd>Specifies the name of the output file. The extension is automatically given as <tt>.h</tt></dd>
			<dt><b>filename</b>
			<dd>The name of a binary file. A list of &quot;extern&quot; declarations is created from the array names that are generated when an object file is made for the listed binary filenames, and this list is output to a C header.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p>This tool outputs to a header file, so you need to rewrite the actual routine in the program to correspond to its contents.
