		<h2>Previewer - Samples</h2>
		<p>
		<hr size="3">
		<h3>1. Description</h3>
		<p>A number of samples have been prepared in order to help you gain a better understanding of the Previewer. These include <tt>sample1.txt</tt>, <tt>sample2.txt</tt>, <tt>sample3.txt</tt>, <tt>sample4.txt</tt> and <tt>anim_sample.txt</tt> in the Previewer folder and the &quot;sample&quot; folder images.</p>
		<h3>2. How to Use the Samples</h3>
		<p><tt>sample1.txt</tt> -- A simple object sample<br>
		<tt>sample2.txt</tt> -- This sample uses the include file<br>
		<tt>sample3.txt</tt> -- A BG sample<br>
		<tt>sample4.txt</tt> -- A composite sample of objects and BG<br>
		</p>
		<p>For <tt>sample1.txt</tt> and <tt>sample3.txt</tt>, enter separately as<br>
		&gt;<tt>prev.sh sample1.txt</tt><br>
		&gt;<tt>prev.sh sample3.txt</tt><br>
		to make an <tt>agbprev.bin</tt> AGB execution file in the same folders, which you then send to the emulator.<br>
		For <tt>sample2.txt</tt> and <tt>sample4.txt</tt>, first enter<br>
		&gt;<tt>prevprep sample2.txt -o sample_tmp.txt</tt><br>
		&gt;<tt>prevprep sample4.txt -o sample_tmp.txt</tt><br>
		to pass through the preprocessor, and then execute<br>
		&gt;<tt>prev.sh sample_tmp.txt</tt><br>
		This command makes an <tt>agbprev.bin</tt> file as mentioned above, which you then send to the emulator.<br>
		<br>
		The latter two files reference <tt>anim_sample.txt</tt> for the animation data. The preprocessor incorporates this into the sample. The same file is referenced, so in sample2 and sample4 different characters are animated the same way.
