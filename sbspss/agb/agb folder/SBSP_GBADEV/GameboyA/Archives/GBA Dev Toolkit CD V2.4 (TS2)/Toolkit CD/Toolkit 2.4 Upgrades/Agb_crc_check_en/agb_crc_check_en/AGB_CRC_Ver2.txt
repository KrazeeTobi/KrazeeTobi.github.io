 The attached utility, "nrdc" is used for the CRC calculation of 
 the AGB Master Data.  

 Originally, "nrdc" was a utility that was only used for master data management 
 and  Nintendo 64.  However, the function to "calculate CRC of data" can also be 
 used for AGB Master Data.

 [Note] Other functions of "nrdc" like "Patch in the ROM registration data area"
 and "Dump the ROM registration data" cannot be used for AGB Master Data because 
 these functions are used exclusively for Nintendo 64 Master Data. 
	
          Usage:	

          This command line utility is executed from the DOS prompt in Windows.  

       	  nrdc [Option] [Filename]

          The following options can be used with AGB:

               -h          Help display 
               -l          Specify as little endian 
               -c          CRC calculation

  [Note] Using other options is prohibited with AGB.  

  About Endianness 

  This program is based on the condition that the order in which the file data is 
  stored is handled by little endian.   
      	  
  The mask ROM for Nintendo 64 has 16 bit wide data.  Therefore, in case of big 
  endian, the upper byte is stored in the even number address of the file, and 
  the lower byte is stored in the odd number address of the file.  In case of 
  little endian, it will be opposite. When neither "-b" nor "-l" is specified, it 
  checks the last one character of the file name.  If "B", it's identified as big 
  endian, and if "L", it's identified as little endian. 

          Reference:

     	  >nrdc -c -l ******.SRL

  *Unify the extension of a file name for the AGB Master Data as "SRL".  
  *Get a result of the calculation for the AGB Master Data by little endian. 
  *Since the result may not be accurate if an extension is changed, 
   specify little endian by adding  "-l" (lower case l) option as much  
   as possible.
