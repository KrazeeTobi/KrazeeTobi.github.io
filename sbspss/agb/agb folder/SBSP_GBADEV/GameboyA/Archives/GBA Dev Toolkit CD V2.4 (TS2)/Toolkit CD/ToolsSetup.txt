<Introduction>

Here we will explain how to set up the GameBoy Advance (hereinafter AGB) 
development environment. 

<Operating Environment>

Operating system: Windows95/98/NT4.0 SP3 or later
Recommended machine: Machine equipped with at least a Pentium processor
Recommended memory: 64MB or more main memory, 4096 initial environment variables 
                    for DOS (Windows 95/98)
Recommended HDD space: There should be at least 900MB free space on the hard 
		       drive (if including all the GnuPro tools)
Minimum HDD space: 420MB

* UNIX-based operation and building are not supported.
* Windows 2000 is not supported. 

<Setup Wizard>

1. Double-click on AGBLibrary.exe from the CD (Game Boy Advance Developers ToolKit
   2.0) and install the software as instructed by the installation program.  Once 
   setup is completed, the libraries, macros, headers, various samples, and all 
   manuals that are necessary for development of AGB applications will have been 
   installed under the [drive name]:\agb directory. 

2. Next, double-click on GNUPro.exe from the CD (Game Boy Advance Developers 
   ToolKit 2.0) and install the software as instructed by the installation program.  
   Once setup is completed, the 16-bit command build environment of thumbelf-000512
   for Cygnus Solutions' ARM7TDMI and native-99rl (BASH shell) are installed under
   the [drive name]:\Program files\cygnus directory. 

* When changing the install directory, you need to change the setting of 
  AGBDIR,CYGNUSDIR in AgbGNUProBash.bat. This is because the default path of the 
  environmental parameter CYGNUSDIR is presumed to be in the same directory. 
 
* The 32-bit command building environment armelf-XXXXXX is in the root directory of 
  the CD as armelf-000512.zip.  It can be copied and used as necessary. (Free space
  of 460MB is necessary to decompress this file.)


3. This completes installation of the software. 
   Now, turn off the power to the personal computer (PC). 

4. Now set up the hardware. 
   Have the following items ready.
   -IS-AGB-EMULATOR (or DEBUGGER or CHARACTER or ANIMEVIEWER, etc.)
    {The hardware for which the AGB is set up will be indicated by a checkmark 
    on the label on the back of the unit.}
   -SCSI cable (purchase separately) 
   -Generic SCSI2 card for PC (purchase separately) 
   -AGB target board (A special AGB adapter is included)
   -WIDEBOY-AGB (necessary and included when the target board does not have an LCD)
   -NINTENDO64 (necessary along with the WIDEBOY-AGB when the target board does 
    not have an LCD.  Standard commercial product must be purchased separately.) 
   -TV monitor (necessary when the target board does not have an LCD)

5. With the power to the PC off, connect the SCSI card and the IS-AGB-EMULATOR 
   with as short a cable as possible.  See the included manuals for details. 

6. Connect the ribbon cable included with the IS-AGB-EMULATOR to P8 on the AGB 
   target board. Next, connect the red and black cable included with the target 
   board to the white 6-pin connector on the AGB Game Pak.  Connect the other end 
   of this cable to the P5 connector on the AGB target board.  (Resets and 
   interrupts will have no effect unless this is connected.)  
   Finally, attach one of the included AC adaptors.

   If there is no LCD on the target board, install a dedicated cable between the 
   special WIDE-BOY64 for the AGB target board and the P7 connector on the target 
   board. Then, connect the WIDE-BOY64 to the NINTENDO64 to complete hardware setup. 

7. Turn on the power to the IS-AGB-EMULATOR and the target board.  
   The power switch for the target board is the large sliding switch (SW1) at 
   the front of the board.  Then, turn on the power to the PC. 

8. Install the emulator from the CD included with the IS-AGB-EMULATOR. 
   (See the IS-AGB-EMULATOR documentation for details.)

9. Select [Start]->[Program]->[IS-AGB-EMULATOR]->[IS-AGB-EMULATOR] to check 
    operation. 

10. Select [File]->[Open] and select BIN from the dialog box.  Then, select 
    [Browse]->[C:\agb\src\samples\functional_sample\fncsample.bin]. 

11. Once the IS-AGB-EMULATOR has been initialized, data will be transferred to the 
    AGB-target board.  It is functioning normally if the menu is displayed on AGB 
    target board and each function is working. 

12. Next, try compiling the source code. 
    From the Explorer, double click on: 

    {installed drive}:\Program files\cygnus\thumbelf-000512\AgbGNUProBash.bat and 
    start the batch file.

13. The BASH shell will start in the DOS window. 
    If "[/Program Files/Cygnus/thumbelf-000512]" is displayed at the prompt, 
    everything is normal.  In the following description, the prompt will be shown 
    as $. 

* If "Out of environment space" is displayed, either press the 
  Properties button for the AgbGNUProBash.bat batch file, or right click 
  on AgbGNUProBash.bat to select Properties and open a dialog box. 
  Change the parameter of [Memory]->[Environment Variables] to 4096, or something
  similar. 

14. $ cd /agb/src/samples/functional_sample
    $ make

    Execute the above two commands in order to perform make. 
    Confirm that fncsample.bin and fncsample.elf are created in the same directory. 

15. Execute fncsample.bin according to the procedure described in step 10 and check 
    its operation. 

16. The preceding confirms that the system is operating under the AGB 
    development environment. 

    Then, from Explorer, open: {installed drive}:\agb\doc\AGB.htm for use in AGB 
    development. 

* This text is stored in the ROOT directory of the CD, as well as in the 
  {installed drive}:\agb\doc directory.
