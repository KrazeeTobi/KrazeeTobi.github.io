---------------------------------AVI2BMP.zip------------------------------------
06.23.00
 - Updated output files to work with TS2 board libraries.
 - Also made some minor modifications to the makefile output to work with the 
   new version of BMP2AGB.exe.

06.16.00
 - Added WAV file exportation for AVI files with audio data in WAV format (most 
   AVIs are set up like this anyway.)
 - Made minor corrections to closing of child windows in the application. An 
   assertion error was occuring in the Debug build. Added a destroy window 
   function call to fix this issue.
 - Began cleaning up my code and moving functions around so it will be easier
   to read.


---------------------------------Player.zip-------------------------------------
06.23.00
 - Updated the program to work with the new TS2 libraries.

06.16.00
 - Added profiler information. It now prints out de-compression time for each 
   frame, maximum de-compression time, minimum decompression time, average 
   decompression time for each pass through the AVI, frames per second and 
   frame count tp the screen. All times are in micro-seconds, for better
   calculation of actual frames being used - each frame takes 16,743 usec to
   process.
 - Cleaned up code :).
