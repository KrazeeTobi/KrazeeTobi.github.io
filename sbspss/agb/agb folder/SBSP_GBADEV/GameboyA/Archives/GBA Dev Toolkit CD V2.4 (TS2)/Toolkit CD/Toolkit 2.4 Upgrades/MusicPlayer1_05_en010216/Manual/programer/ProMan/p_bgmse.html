<td>In this system, there is absolutely no distinction between background
music, sound effects and other kinds of sounds in the song data.
<p>Whether it is a work with full orchestration or a sound effect like
the beep of a button being pushed, all song data is constructed according
to the same format.
<p>For this reason, all works in this manual, whether they are theme songs, background music or sound effects, are described as "songs." In this system, a "song" is any song data played on the Music Player.</td>
