 The game:

 "Pikachu ga Pokeboru o aishimasu" is Japanese and means "Pikachu loves
Pokéballs". The goal of the game is to catch as many falling-down Pokéballs
as possible. Red Pokéballs give you 1 point, blue ones, 3 and golden ones, 5.
There are three stages. Press enter on the title screen and then use the left/right
keys to move Pikachu. Have fun with high-score breaking.
