rules are rules written with ‘</FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>::</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’
instead of ‘</FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>:</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’
after the target names. They are handled differently from ordinary rules
when the same target appears in more than one rule.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When a target appears in
multiple rules, all the rules must be the same type: all ordinary, or all
double-colon. If they are double-colon, each of them is independent of
the others. Each double-colon rule’s commands are executed if the target
is older than any dependencies of that rule. This can result in executing
none, any, or all of the double-colon rules.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Double-colon rules with the
same target are in fact completely separate from one another. Each double-colon
rule is processed individually, just as rules with different targets are
processed.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The double-colon rules for
a target are executed in the order they appear in the makefile. However,
the cases where double-colon rules really make sense are those where the
order of executing the commands would not matter.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Double-colon rules are somewhat
obscure and not often very useful; they provide a mechanism for cases in
which the method used to update a target differs depending on which dependency
files caused the update, and such cases are rare.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Each double-colon rule should
specify commands; if it does not, an implicit rule will be used if one
applies. See <FONT COLOR="#008000"><A HREF="makeUsing_Implicit_Rules.html">Using
implicit rules</A></FONT>.</FONT></FONT>
