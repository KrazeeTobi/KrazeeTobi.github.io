		<p>Game Boy Advanced (AGB) stresses portability and focuses on 2D rather than 3D image processing functions, resulting in a cutting-edge portable game device with revolutionary capabilities.</p>
		<p>It provides window-like functions, rotation, scaling, <img src="alpha.gif"> blending, and fade-in/fade-out features that can be combined to produce exactly the image representations desired.</p>
		<p>Additionally, the bitmap image-rendering function, with its two modes (double buffering mode for rewriting full-screen images in real time and single buffering mode for stills), can be used to handle realistic images that are indistinguishable from actual photographs.</p>
		<p>The 2.9-inch-wide reflective TFT color LCD screen provides a clear display with little afterimage.</p>
		<p>In addition to Game Boy Color compatible sound, AGB has a PCM stereo sound generator. Multiple tracks can be played simultaneously by overlapping them using the CPU. L and R buttons have been added to the Controller. The broader range of control provided also expands the breadth of game designs possible.</p>
		<p>Although AGB uses a 32-bit RISC CPU whose computing performance and data processing capabilities far surpass those of Game Boy Color, it consumes little power, allowing approximately 20 hours of continuous play. This is made possible by the inclusion of the various types of RAM on a single custom chip.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, software for AGB can be developed using the C language, minimizing the cost of development equipment. This favorable development environment and the high level of freedom of the system configuration allow one to build a profound world of play in which anyone can become absorbed.</p>
		<p>With its extremely high-performance computational and data processing capabilities as a foundation, AGB provides greater image and sound representation capabilities, making the pursuit of fun its essential aim.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this high level of performance is to bring unique game ideas fully to life.</p>
		<p>AGB is an innovation born from experience. While providing backwards compatibility with the enormous software resources available for the millions of Game Boy units in use worldwide, it also breaks new ground for portable game devices.
