illustrate the output of </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff3</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and how various options can change it. The first two files are the same that
we used for </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difTwo_Sample_Input_Files.html">Two Sample Input Files</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">).

</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3"><B>The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way; 
<BR>The name that can be named is not the eternal name. 
<BR>The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; 
<BR>The named is the mother of all things.
<P>
Therefore let there always be non-being, 
<BR>  so we may see their subtlety, 
<BR>And let there always be being, 
<BR>  so we may see their result. 
<BR>The two are the same, 
<BR>But after they are produced, 
<BR>  they have different names.
