<div CLASS="Heading2"><a NAME="Year_2000_compliance"></a><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Year
2000 compliance</font></font></i></b></div>

<div CLASS="Body"><font size=-1>This and all subsequent releases of the
GNUPro Toolkit products are <i>Year 2000 Compliant</i> (Y2K).</font>
<br><font size=-1>For more information regarding Cygnus development and
Y2K issues, see:</font>
<br><tt>http://www.cygnus.com/y2k.html</tt>
<br><font size=-1>Cygnus Solutions defines a product to be Year 2000 Compliant
(Y2K) if it does not produce errors in recording, storing, processing and
presenting calendar dates as a result of the transition from December 31,
1999 to January 1, 2000.</font>
<br><font size=-1>A Year 2000 compliant product will recognize the Year
2000 as a leap year.&nbsp; This compliance is contingent upon third party
products that exchange date data with the Cygnus product doing so properly
and accurately, in a form and format compatible with the Cygnus product.</font>
<br><font size=-1>GNUPro Toolkit processes dates only to the extent of
using the date data provided by the host or target operating system for
date representation used in internal processes, such as file modifications.
Any Y2K issues resulting from the operation of the Cygnus products, therefore,
are necessarily dependent upon the Y2K compliance of relevant host and/or
target operating systems. Cygnus has not tested all operating systems and,
as such, cannot assure that every system and/or environment will manage
and manipulate data involving dates before and after December 31, 1999,
without any time or date related system defects or abnormalities, and without
any decreases in functionality or performance.&nbsp; Cygnus cannot assure
that applications which you modify using Cygnus products will be Year 2000
compliant.</font></div>
