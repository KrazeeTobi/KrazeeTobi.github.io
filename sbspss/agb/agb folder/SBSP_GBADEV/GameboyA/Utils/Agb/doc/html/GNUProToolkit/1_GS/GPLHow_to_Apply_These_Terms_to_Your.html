<HR SIZE=6 WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If you
develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>To do so, attach the following
notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each
file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the
full notice is found.</FONT></FONT>

you use may be called something other than </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">show

a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. The following is
a sample (when copying, alter the names).</FONT></FONT>
