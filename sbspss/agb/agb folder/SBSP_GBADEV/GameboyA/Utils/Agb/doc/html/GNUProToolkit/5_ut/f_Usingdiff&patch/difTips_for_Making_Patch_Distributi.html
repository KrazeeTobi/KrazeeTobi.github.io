<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">The following are some things you should keep in mind if you are going to
distribute patches for updating a software package. 
<P>
Make sure you have specified the file names correctly, either in a context
diff header or with an '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">Index:</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' line. If you are patching files in a subdirectory, be sure to tell the patch
user to specify a '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">-p</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' or '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">--strip</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' option as needed. Take care to not send out reversed patches, since these
make people wonder whether they have already applied the patch. 
<P>
To save people from partially applying a patch before other patches that
should have gone before it, you can make the first patch in the patch file update a
file with a name like '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patchlevel.h</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' or'</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">version.c</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">', which contains a patch level or version number. If the input file contains
the wrong version number, patch will complain immediately. 
<P>
An even clearer way to prevent this problem is to put a '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">Prereq:</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' line before the patch. If the leading text in the patch file contains a line
that starts with '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">Prereq:</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">', </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> takes the next word from that line (normally a version number) and checks
whether the next input file contains that word, preceded and followed by either
white space or a newline. If not, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> prompts you for confirmation before proceeding. This makes it difficult to
accidentally apply patches in the wrong order. 
<P>
Since </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> does not handle incomplete lines properly, make sure that all the source
files in your program end with a newline whenever you release a version. 
<P>
To create a patch that changes an older version of a package into a newer
version, first make a copy of the older version in a scratch directory. Typically
you do that by unpacking a </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">tar</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> or </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">shar</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> archive of the older version. 
<P>
You might be able to reduce the size of the patch by renaming or removing some
files before making the patch. If the older version of the package contains
any files that the newer version does not, or if any files have been renamed
between the two versions, make a list of </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">rm</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">mv</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> commands for the user to execute in the old version directory before applying
the patch. Then run those commands yourself in the scratch directory. 
<P>
If there are any files that you don't need to include in the patch because
they can easily be rebuilt from other files (for example, '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">TAGS</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' and output from </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">yacc</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">makeinfo</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">), replace the versions in the scratch directory with the newer versions,
using </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">rm</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">ln</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> or </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">cp</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">.
<P>
Now you can create the patch. The de-facto standard </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> format for patch distributions is context format with two lines of context,
produced by giving </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> the '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">-C</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">2</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' option. Do not use less than two lines of context, because patch typically
needs at least two lines for proper operation. 
<P>
Give diff the '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">-P</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' option in case the newer version of the package contains any files that the
older one does not. Make sure to specify the scratch directory first and the
newer directory second. 
<P>
Add to the top of the patch a note telling the user any </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">rm</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">mv</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> commands to run before applying the patch. Then you can remove the scratch
directory.
