How to upgrade GNUPro-98r2-->GNUPro-99r1 (Example: yoshi)


** We no longer prefix  "_" to symbols referred between GAS<---->GCC.  

crt0.s

    .EXTERN     IntrTable

        ldr     r1, =IntrTable          @ jump to user IRQ processing 

** Conversely, when referring symbols created by OBJCOPY using GCC or GAS, you 
   need to prefix "_" to symbols.   

menu_dat.c

    _binary_yoshi_island_990907_0_1_imb_start,


** When the main symbol is defined, a library that is not being used will be 
   linked.  You can cut down the code size by adopting other symbols.  

crt0.s

    .EXTERN     AgbMain

        ldr     r1, =AgbMain            @ Start & switch to 16 bit code  

main.c

void AgbMain(void)
{
}
