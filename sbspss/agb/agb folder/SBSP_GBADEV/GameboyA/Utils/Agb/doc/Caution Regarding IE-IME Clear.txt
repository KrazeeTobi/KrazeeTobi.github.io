Interrupts may occur during execution of instructions to clear the IE or IME flag.

If you would like to clear the IE flag, clear the IME flag first, so that an inconsistency
in interrupt checking will not occur.

When using multiple interrupts, and an interrupt coincides with clearing the IME flag,
the interrupt routine will still occur, even though interrupts are disabled
( IME flag is cleared ). This will cause the interrupt routines to become "out of sync"
with the IME flag. Therefore, please program the interrupt routines to save the IME flag
and IE/IF registers, and then re-enable the IME flag so that multiple interrupts can occur.
This condition is pretty rare, but must be considered when programming your game.
