<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">The following are two sample files that we will use in numerous examples to
illustrate the output of </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and how various options can change it. The following is the file, '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3"><B>lao</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">'.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3"><B>The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way; 
<BR>The name that can be named is not the eternal name. 
<BR>The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; 
<BR>The Named is the mother of all things. 
<BR>Therefore let there always be non-being,
<BR>   so we may see their subtlety,
<BR>And let there always be being,
<BR>   so we may see their outcome. 
<BR>The two are the same, 
<BR>But after they are produced,
<BR>   they have different names.

<BR>Deeper and more profound, 
<BR>The door of all subtleties!
