<BR>
<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Information
can be lost during output</I>. The output formats supported by BFD do not
provide identical facilities, and information which can be described in
one form has nowhere to go in another format. One example of this is alignment
information in </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>b.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>.
There is nowhere in an </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>a.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>
format file to store alignment information on the contained data, so when
a file is linked from </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>b.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>
and an </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>a.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>
image is produced, alignment information will not propagate to the output
file. (The linker will still use the alignment information internally,
so the link is performed correctly).</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Another example is COFF section
names. COFF files may contain an unlimited number of sections, each one
with a textual section name. If the target of the link is a format which
does not have many sections (e.g., </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>a.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>)
or has sections without names (e.g., the Oasys format), the link cannot
be done simply. You can circumvent this problem by describing the desired
input-to-output section mapping with the linker command language.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Information can be lost
during canonicalization</I>. The BFD internal canonical form of the external
formats is not exhaustive; there are structures in input formats for which
there is no direct representation internally. This means that the BFD back
ends cannot maintain all possible data richness through the transformation
between external to internal and back to external formats.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This limitation is only a
problem when an application reads one format and writes another. Each BFD
back end is responsible for maintaining as much data as possible, and the
internal BFD canonical form has structures which are opaque to the BFD
core, and exported only to the back ends. When a file is read in one format,
the canonical form is generated for BFD and the application. At the same
time, the back end saves away any information which may otherwise be lost.
If the data is then written back in the same format, the back end routine
will be able to use the canonical form provided by the BFD core as well
as the information it prepared earlier. Since there is a great deal of
commonality between back ends, there is no information lost when linking
or copying big endian COFF to little endian COFF, or </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>a.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>
to </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>b.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>.
When a mixture of formats is linked, the information is only lost from
the files whose format differs from the destination.</FONT></FONT>
