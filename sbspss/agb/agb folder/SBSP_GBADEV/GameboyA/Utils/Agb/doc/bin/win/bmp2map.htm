		<h2>bmp2map<font size="3"> [Tool Command]</font></h2>
		<p><font color="red">Converts a Bitmap assembled from 8x8-dot parts into AGB BG data.</font></p>
		<h3>Syntax</h3>
		<pre><code>bmp2map [-o/-f/-p/-c/-b/-B/-P/-M] input-file</code></pre>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>AGB BG data is formed from the assembly of 8x8-dot parts. This tool divides the parts out from a Bitmap previously assembled from parts, and then outputs map data based on these parts. The output format can be binary or C source. If a parts file has not been input, this tool also will automatically create the parts. This parts data will be the same as that created by the &quot;agbparts&quot; tool.</p>
		<p>The command arguments are described below:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>input-file </b>
			<dd>Inputs a bitmap assembled from parts.
			<dt><b>-o output-file </b>
			<dd>Specifies the name of the output file. If no name is specified, it will take the base name of the input file plus the extension appropriate for that output format.
			<dt><b>-f </b>
			<dd>Treats parts and their vertical &amp; horizontal mirrors as the same. This argument is set automatically when the input bitmap is 4bit.
			<dt><b>-p palette-number </b>
			<dd>The palette number that is set when the input bitmap is 4bit. All map palette numbers are set to be the same. The default value is 0.
			<dt><b>-c parts-file </b>
			<dd>Inputs a bitmap expressing parts data. Specify this argument when you want to output map data put together from parts you have set yourself. When a character which is not in this parts data is used, the character will be added to the parts data.
			<dt><b>-b </b>
			<dd>Outputs in binary. If this argument is not specified the data is output in C source.
			<dt><b>-B </b>
			<dd>Outputs characters in binary output mode. The filename automatically takes the <tt>.imb</tt> extension.
			<dt><b>-P </b>
			<dd>Outputs palettes in binary output mode. The filename automatically takes the <tt>.plb</tt> extension.
			<dt><b>-M </b>
			<dd>Outputs map data in binary output mode. The filename automatically takes the <tt>.mpb</tt> extension. This argument is set automatically when <tt>-b</tt> is set and <tt>-B</tt> <tt>-P</tt> are not.
		</dl>
		<h3>Note</h3>
		<p>Supports the 4bit, 4bit RLE-compressed, 8bit and 8bit RLE-compressed image formats. An error will occur if the parts exceed the useable limit on the AGB. If more parts are used than were input, the 'number of added parts' and the 'total number of parts' are displayed. The inputted parts data is not optimized.
