</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">There are several ways to think about the differences between two files. One
way to think of the differences is as a series of lines that were deleted from,
inserted in, or changed in one file to produce another file. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> compares two files line by line, finds groups of lines that differ, and
reports each group of differing lines. See </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difHunks.html">Hunks</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> for more documentation. It can report the differing lines in several formats,
which have different purposes.
<P>
GNU </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> can show whether files are different without detailing the differences. It
also provides ways to suppress certain kinds of differences that are not
important to you. Most commonly, such differences are changes in the amount of white
space between words or lines. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> also provides ways to suppress differences in alphabetic case or in lines
that match a regular expression that you provide. These options can accumulate;
for example, you can ignore changes in both white space and alphabetic case.

Another way to think of the differences between two files is as a sequence of
pairs of characters that can be either identical or different. For more, see </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difBinary_Files_and_Forcing_Text_Co.html">Binary Files and Forcing Text Comparisons</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">cmp</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> reports the differences between two files character by character, instead of
line by line. As a result, it is more useful than </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> for comparing binary files. For text files, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">cmp</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> is useful mainly when you want to know only whether two files are identical. 
<P>
To illustrate the effect that considering changes character by character can
have compared with considering them line by line, think of what happens if a
single newline character is added to the beginning of a file. If that file is then
compared with an otherwise identical file that lacks the newline at the
beginning, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> will report that a blank line has been added to the file, while </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">cmp</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> will report that almost every character of the two files differs.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff3</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> normally compares three input files line by line, finds groups of lines that
differ, and reports each group of differing lines. Its output is designed to
make it easy to inspect two different sets of changes to the same file.
