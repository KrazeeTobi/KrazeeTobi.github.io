<BR><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This section is a political
message from the League for Programming Freedom to the users of GNU CC.</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>We have included it here
because the issue of interface copyright is important to the GNU project.</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Apple, Lotus, and now CDC
have tried to create a new form of legal monopoly: a copyright on a user
interface.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>An interface is a kind of
language—a set of conventions for communication between two entities, human
or machine. Until a few years ago, the law seemed clear: interfaces were
outside the domain of copyright, so programmers could program freely and
implement whatever interface the users demanded. Imitating de-facto standard
interfaces, sometimes with improvements, was standard practice in the computer
field. These improvements, if accepted by the users, caught on and became
the norm; in this way, much progress took place.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Computer users, and most
software developers, were happy with this state of affairs. However, large
companies such as Apple and Lotus would prefer a different system—one in
which they can own interfaces and thereby rid themselves of all serious
competitors. They hope that interface copyright will give them, in effect,
monopolies on major classes of software.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Other large companies such
as IBM and Digital also favor interface monopolies, for the same reason:
if languages become property, they expect to own many de-facto standard
languages. But Apple and Lotus are the ones who have actually sued. Apple’s
lawsuit was defeated, for reasons only partly related to the general issue
of interface copyright.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Lotus won lawsuits against
two small companies, which were thus put out of business. Then they sued
Borland; they won in the trial court (no surprise, since it was the same
court that had ruled for Lotus twice before), but the decision was reversed
by the court of appeals, with help from the League for Programming Freedom
in the form of a friend-of-the-court brief. We are now waiting to see if
the Supreme Court will hear the case. If it does, the League for Programming
Freedom will again submit a brief.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The battle is not over. A
company that produced a simulator for a CDC computer was shut down by a
copyright lawsuit by CDC, which charged that the simulator infringed the
copyright on the manuals for the computer.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If the monopolists get their
way, they will hobble the software field:</FONT></FONT>
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Gratuitous incompatibilities
will burden users. Imagine if each car manufacturer had to design a different
way to start, stop, and steer a car.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Users will be “locked in” to
whichever interface they learn; then they will be prisoners of one supplier,
who will charge a monopolistic price.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Large companies have an unfair
advantage wherever lawsuits become commonplace. Since they can afford to
sue, they can intimidate smaller developers with threats even when they
don’t really have a case.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Interface improvements will
come slower, since incremental evolution through creative partial imitation
will no longer occur.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If interface monopolies are
accepted, other large companies are waiting to grab theirs:</FONT></FONT>
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Adobe is expected to claim a
monopoly on the interfaces of various popular application programs, if
Lotus ultimately wins the case against Borland.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Open Computing magazine reported
a Microsoft vice president as threatening to sue people who imitate the
interface of Windows.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Users invest a great deal of
time and money in learning to use computer interfaces. Far more, in fact,
than software developers invest in developing and even implementing the
interfaces. Whoever can own an interface, has made its users into captives,
and misappropriated their investment.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>To protect our freedom from
monopolies like these, a group of programmers and users have formed a grass-roots
political organization, the League for Programming Freedom.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The purpose of the League
is to oppose monopolistic practices such as interface copyright and software
patents. The League calls for a return to the legal policies of the recent
past, in which programmers could program freely. The League is not concerned
with free software as an issue, and is not affiliated with the Free Software
Foundation.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The League’s activities include
publicizing the issues, as is being done here, and filing friend-of-the-court
briefs on behalf of defendants sued by monopolists.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The League’s membership rolls
include Donald Knuth, the foremost authority on algorithms, John McCarthy,
inventor of Lisp, Marvin Minsky, founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence
lab, Guy L. Steele, Jr., author of well-known books on Lisp and C, as well
as Richard Stallman, the developer of GNU CC. Please join and add your
name to the list. Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers,
managers and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Activist members are especially
important, but members who have no time to give are also important. Surveys
at major ACM conferences have indicated a vast majority of attendees agree
with the League on both issues (interface copyrights and software patents).
If just ten percent of the programmers who agree with the League join the
League, we will probably triumph.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>To join, or for more information,
phone (617) 243-4091 or write to the League at the following address.</FONT></FONT>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Tell your friends and colleagues
about this issue and how it threatens to ruin the computer industry.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Mention that you are a League
member in your ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>.signature</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>,’
and mention the League’s email address for inquiries.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Ask the companies you consider
working for or working with to make statements against software monopolies,
and give preference to those that do.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When employers ask you to sign
contracts giving them copyright on your work, insist on a clause saying
they will not claim the copyright covers imitating the interface.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When employers ask you to sign
contracts giving them patent rights, insist on clauses saying they can
use these rights only defensively. Don’t rely on company policy,” since
policies can change at any time; don’t rely on an individual executive’s
private word, since that person may be replaced. Get a commitment just
as binding as the commitment they get from you.</FONT></FONT></LI>

the importance of these issues.</FONT></FONT></LI>
