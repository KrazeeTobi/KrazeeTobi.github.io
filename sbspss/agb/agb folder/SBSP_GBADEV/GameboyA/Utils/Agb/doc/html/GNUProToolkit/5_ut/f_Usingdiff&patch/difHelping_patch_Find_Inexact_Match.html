</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">For context diffs, and to a lesser extent normal diffs, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> can detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and it
attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch. As a first
guess, it takes the line number mentioned in the hunk, plus or minus any
offset used in applying the previous hunk. If that is not the correct place, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> scans both forward and backward for a set of lines matching the context given
in the hunk. 
<P>
First </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> looks for a place where all lines of the context match. If it cannot find
such a place, and it is reading a context or unified diff, and the maximum fuzz
factor is set to 1 or more, then patch makes another scan, ignoring the first and
last line of context. If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2
or more, it makes another scan, ignoring the first two and last two lines of
context are ignored. It continues similarly if the maximum fuzz factor is larger. 
<P>
The '</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">-F</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3"><I>lines</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' or'</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">--fuzz=<I>lines</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">' option sets the maximum fuzz factor to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3"><I>lines</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">. This option only applies to context and unified diffs; it ignores up to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3"><I>lines</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> lines while looking for the place to install a hunk. Note that a larger fuzz
factor increases the odds of making a faulty patch. The default fuzz factor is
2; it may not be set to more than the number of lines of context in the diff,
ordinarily 3. 
<P>
If </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> cannot find a place to install a hunk of the patch, it writes the hunk out to
a reject file (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difReject_File_Names.html">Reject File Names</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> for information on how reject files are named). It writes out rejected hunks
in context format no matter what form the input patch is in. If the input is a
normal or </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">ed</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> diff, many of the contexts are simply null. The line numbers on the hunks in
the reject file may be different from those in the patch file; they show the
approximate location where </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file rather than in the old one. 
<P>
As it completes each hunk, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> tells you whether the hunk succeeded or failed, and if it failed, on which
line (in the new file) </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> thinks the hunk should go. If this is different from the line number
specified in the diff, it tells you the offset. A single large offset may indicate that </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> installed a hunk in the wrong place. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> also tells you if it used a fuzz factor to make the match, in which case you
should also be slightly suspicious.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">ed</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> script, and can only detect wrong line numbers in a normal </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> when it finds a change or delete command. It may have the same problem with a
context diff using a fuzz factor equal to or greater than the number of lines
of context shown in the diff (typically 3). In these cases, you should probably
look at a context diff between your original and patched input files to see if
the changes make sense. Compiling without errors is a pretty good indication
that the patch worked, but not a guarantee.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> usually produces the correct results, even when it must make many guesses.
However, the results are guaranteed only when the patch is applied to an exact
copy of the file that the patch was generated from.
