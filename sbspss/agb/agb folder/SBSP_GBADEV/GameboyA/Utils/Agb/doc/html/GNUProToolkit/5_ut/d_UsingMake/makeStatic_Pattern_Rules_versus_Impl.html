<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A static
pattern rule has much in common with an implicit rule defined as a pattern
rule (see <FONT COLOR="#008000"><A HREF="makeDefining_and_Redefining_Pattern_.html">Defining
and redefining pattern rules</A></FONT>). Both have a pattern for the target
and patterns for constructing the names of dependencies. The difference
is in how </FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>make</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>
decides <I>when</I> the rule applies.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>An implicit rule can apply
to any target that matches its pattern, but it <I>does</I> apply only when
the target has no commands otherwise specified, and only when the dependencies
can be found. If more than one implicit rule appears applicable, only one
applies; the choice depends on the order of rules.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>By contrast, a static pattern
rule applies to the precise list of targets that you specify in the rule.
It cannot apply to any other target and it invariably does apply to each
of the targets specified. If two conflicting rules apply, and both have
commands, that’s an error. The static pattern rule can be better than an
implicit rule for the following reasons.</FONT></FONT>

usual implicit rule for a few files whose names cannot be categorized syntactically
but can be given in an explicit list.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If you cannot be sure of the
precise contents of the directories you are using, you may not be sure
which other irrelevant files might lead make to use the wrong implicit
rule. The choice might depend on the order in which the implicit rule search
is done. With static pattern rules, there is no uncertainty: each rule
applies to precisely the targets specified.</FONT></FONT></LI>
