patches for GNU CC&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;</font></font>
<hr SIZE=6 WIDTH="100%">
<br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you would like to write
bug fixes or improvements for the GNU C compiler, that is very helpful.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Send suggested fixes to the
bug report mailing list:</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0><a href="mailto:bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu">bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Please follow these guidelines
so we can study your patches efficiently. If you don’t follow these guidelines,
your information might still be useful, but using it will take extra work.
Maintaining GNU C is a lot of work in the best of circumstances, and we
can’t keep up unless you do your best to help.</font></font>
<ul TYPE=SQUARE>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Send an explanation with your
changes of what problem they fix or what improvement they bring about.
For a bug fix, just include a copy of the bug report, and explain why the
change fixes the bug.</font></font></li>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>(Referring to a bug report is
not as good as including it, because then we will have to look it up, and
we have probably already deleted it if we’ve already fixed the bug.)</font></font></dt>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Always include a proper bug
report for the problem you think you have fixed. We need to convince ourselves
that the change is right before installing it. Even if it is right, we
might have trouble judging it if we don’t have a way to reproduce the problem.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Include all the comments that
are appropriate to help people reading the source in the future understand
why this change was needed.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Don’t mix together changes made
for different reasons. Send them <i>individually</i>.</font></font></li>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you make two changes for
separate reasons, then we might not want to install them both. We might
want to install just one. If you send them all jumbled together in a single
set of diffs, we have to do extra work to disentangle them—to figure out
which parts of the change serve which purpose. If we don’t have time for
this, we might have to ignore your changes entirely.</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you send each change as soon
as you have written it, with its own explanation, then the two changes
never get tangled up, and we can consider each one properly without any
extra work to disentangle them. Ideally, each change you send should be
impossible to subdivide into parts that we might want to consider separately,
because each of its parts gets its motivation from the other parts.</font></font></dt>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Send each change as soon as
that change is finished. Sometimes people think they are helping us by
accumulating many changes to send them all together. This is absolutely
the worst thing you could do. Since you should send each change separately,
you might as well send it right away. That gives us the option of installing
it immediately if it is important.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Use ‘</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>diff
-c</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>’ to make your
diffs. Diffs without context are hard for us to install reliably. More
than that, they make it hard for us to study the diffs to decide whether
we want to install them. Unidiff format is better than diffs without context,
but not as easy to read as ‘</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>-c</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>’
format.</font></font></li>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you have GNU diff, use a
‘</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>diff -cp</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>’
declaration, which shows the name of the function that each change occurs
in.</font></font></dt>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Write the change log entries
for your changes. We get lots of changes, and we don’t have time to do
all the change log writing ourselves.</font></font></li>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Read the ‘</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>ChangeLog</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>’
file to see what sorts of information to put in, and to learn the style
that we use. The purpose of the change log is to show people where to find
what was changed. So you need to be specific about what functions you changed;
in large functions, it’s often helpful to indicate where within the function
the change was.</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>On the other hand, once you
have shown people where to find the change, you need not explain its purpose.
Thus, if you add a new function, all you need to say about it is that it
is new. If you feel that the purpose needs explaining, it probably does—but
the explanation will be much more useful if you put it in comments in the
code.</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you would like your name
to appear in the header line for who made the change, send us the header
line.</font></font></dt>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When you write the fix, keep
in mind that we can’t install a change that would break other systems.</font></font></li>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>People often suggest fixing
a problem by changing machine-independent files such as ‘</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>toplev.c</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>’
to do something special that a particular system needs. Sometimes it is
totally obvious that such changes would break GNU CC for almost all users.
We can’t possibly make a change like that. At best it might tell us how
to write another patch that would solve the problem acceptably.</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Sometimes people send fixes
that <i>might</i> be an improvement in general—but it is hard to be sure
of this. It’s hard to install such changes because we have to study them
very carefully. Of course, a good explanation of the reasoning by which
you concluded the change was correct can help convince us.</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The safest changes are changes
to the configuration files for a particular machine. These are safe because
they can’t create new bugs on other machines.</font></font></dt>

<br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Please help us keep up with
the workload by designing the patch in a form that is good to install.</font></font></ul>
