<font size=-2>Source-Navigator™ is a trademark of Cygnus Solutions.</font>
<br><font size=-2>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY
BEFORE OPENING THE PACKAGE CONTAINING THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR PROGRAM DISK
OR BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE FROM CYGNUS’&nbsp;&nbsp;
WEBSITE OR INSTALLING THAT SOFTWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER. YOUR OPENING OF THIS
PACKAGE OR DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING OF THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE INDICATES
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE WITH THEM, YOU SHOULD PROMPTLY RETURN THE PACKAGE UNOPENED FOR
A FULL REFUND OR, IF YOU ARE RETRIEVING THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE FROM
CYGNUS’ WEBSITE, YOU SHOULD NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL SUCH SOFTWARE.</font>
<br><font size=-2>1. LICENSE TO USE. The Source-Navigator software program
is copyrighted and title to all copies is retained by Cygnus and/or its
licensors.</font>
<blockquote><font size=-2>a. You are granted a nonexclusive and nontransferable
personal license to download (if you are retrieving the software from Cygnus’
Website), to install and use the Source-Navigator software in machine-readable,
object code form only, or together with accompanying user documentation
(only on “per seat” basis; that is, installing the software on a single
computer to be used by a single user at any one time). You are not authorized
to use the Source-Navigator software concurrently on two or more computers
or in a networked environment without separate authorization from Cygnus
and the payment of applicable license fees.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>b. You may make one copy of the Source-Navigator software
in machine-readable, object code form solely for backup purposes. You may,
for your internal use only, make copies of the printed or on-line versions
of the user documentation, provided that you reproduce all proprietary
rights notices included therein.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>c. You agree not to transfer, electronically transmit
from one computer to another over a network, rent or lease your copy of
the Source-Navigator software or copy (except as permitted in paragraph
b., above), distribute, modify, create derivative works of, decompile,
disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer that software program, in whole
or in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have lawfully acquired
a copy of the Source-Navigator software outside of the United States within
a jurisdiction which is a member of the European Community (EC) subject
to the Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs dated May
14, 1991 (the “Directive”), you agree that within that jurisdiction you
will not, and will not allow any other party on your behalf, to attempt
to reverse engineer or decompile the Source-Navigator software into another
computer language, except as expressly and specifically provided in the
Directive. Any and all information obtained during such lawful reverse
engineering and/or decompiling activities, including but not limited to,
the organization, logic, algorithms and process of the Source-Navigator
software, shall be deemed to be the confidential and proprietary information
of Cygnus and/or its licensors, which you agree to maintain in confidence
and not disclose to any third parties without Cygnus' consent, which consent
may be withheld by Cygnus in its sole discretion. Furthermore, you agree
not to sell, distribute, assign, sublicense or create derivative works
of the documentation.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>d. You agree and certify that neither the Source-Navigator
software nor any other technical data received by you from Cygnus, nor
the direct product thereof, will be exported outside the United States
except as authorized and as permitted by U.S. law. If the foregoing software
has been rightfully obtained by you outside of the U.S., you agree that
you will not re-export that software nor any other technical data received
from Cygnus, nor the direct product thereof, except as permitted by U.S.
law and the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which you obtained
that software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Source-Navigator
software nor any other technical data received by you from Cygnus, may
be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national
or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Iran, Syria
or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to
anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals
or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders. By downloading
or using the Source-Navigator software, you are agreeing to the foregoing,
and you are representing and warranting that you are not located in, under
the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any
such list.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>e. The availability of the Source-Navigator software via
Cygnus’&nbsp; website shall not be deemed to constitute advertising in
such countries where such form, manner or method of advertising is prohibited
by the laws of that foreign country.</font></blockquote>
<font size=-2>2. TERMINATION. This license is effective until terminated.
You may terminate this license at any time by (i) deleting the Source-Navigator
software, and other data made available or supplied to your by Cygnus,
residing in electronic form, (ii) destroying all tangible copies of the
software and the accompanying documentation, and (iii) certifying in writing,
upon request by Cygnus, that you have taken all of the foregoing actions.
This license will also automatically terminate immediately, without notice
from Cygnus, if you fail to comply with any term or condition set forth
herein.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>3. LIMITED WARRANTY. If you are acquiring the Source-Navigator
software on a program disk or other tangible media, Cygnus warrants that
the media on which your copy of that software is furnished will be free
from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period
of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt by you of that media. This
warranty extends only to you as the original end user licensee. Your exclusive
remedy, and Cygnus' entire liability, under this warranty will be the replacement
of any defective media. If Cygnus is unable to correct or replace the defective
media within a reasonable period after receiving your request, you may
terminate this license by returning your copy of the Source-Navigator software
for a full refund of the license fees paid. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS
LICENSE, THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AND LICENSED “AS IS”,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT,
ARE EXCLUDED.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>4. EVALUATION OR “DEMO” VERSIONS. If the copy of the Source-Navigator
software is being used by you for evaluation purposes, you should be aware
that this copy will operate for no longer than the specified evaluation
period. If you have obtained a copy of the “DEMO” version of the Source-Navigator
software, you should be aware that this copy does not contain all of the
features or functionality of a full-featured version. You are responsible
for backing up all of your work created in connection with your use of
such software. CYGNUS SHALL IN NO WAY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR
INFORMATION ON ACCOUNT OF THE USE OF AN EVALUATION, “DEMO” OR FULL-FEATURED
PURCHASED COPY OF THE SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL CYGNUS BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST REVENUES, PROFITS, DATA OR
OTHER INFORMATION, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOURCE-NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE, EVEN IF CYGNUS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or
consequential damages or limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts,
so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty
gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that
vary from state to state.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>6. GOVERNING LAW. The terms of this license shall be construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding (i) that
body of law known as conflicts of law and (ii) the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the Sale of Goods.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This license shall constitute the
entire agreement between Cygnus and you with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between us,
whether written or oral, with respect hereto. No modification to this license
shall be of any force or effect unless made in writing signed by each party.
You agree that you have not relied on any representation in entering into
this license other than those set out herein.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. If the Source-Navigator
software is being acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the United
States Government, the following provisions apply: The Source-Navigator
