<HR SIZE=6 WIDTH="100%">
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The licenses for most software
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change free software— to make sure the software is free for all
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the
GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,
too.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When we speak of free software,
we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software
or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>To protect your rights, we
need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or
to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, if you distribute
copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>We protect your rights with
two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Also, for each author’s protection
and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there
is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors’ reputations.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, any free program
is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger
that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses,
in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made
it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not
licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
