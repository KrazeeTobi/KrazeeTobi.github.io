		<h2>Functional samples: COLOR SPECIAL EFFECT</h2>
		<p><font color="red">This is a sample of color special effects.</font></p>

		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>This is a sample of color special effects.<br>
		In this sample you can change the type of color special effects and turn OBJ semi-transparency ON/OFF.<br>
		BG0 is on the ground to the bottom-right, BG1 is in the air to the top-left, and the three Yoshis starting from the left are OBJ0 and OBJ1 and OBJ2.<br>
		The part falling off the lower-right side is a window, inside which the color special effects are OFF.<br>
		<br>
		When OBJs are made semi-transparent and the color special effect is set to Luminosity UP or Luminosity DOWN, you will see no change in luminosity for parts of the OBJ that are semi-transparent. But you will notice a change in luminosity for those parts that are not semi-transparent (where the pixels directly underneath are not the second object).<br>
		<br>
		Color special effects are OFF inside the Window, so they will have no effect.<br>
		However, a semi-transparent OBJ on top of the second object will be semi-transparent.<br>
		If there is no second object, semi-transparency will not arise.<br>
		Even if a moving OBJ overlaps a fellow OBJ, that fellow OBJ will not become semi-transparent.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>How to operate</h3>
		<p>SELECT button ... Return to Title Menu<br>
		START button ... Change the special effect setting (Normal -&gt; Alpha blend -&gt; Luminosity UP -&gt; Luminosity DOWN)<br>
		START button while pressing B button ... Switch OBJ semi-transparency ON/OFF<br>
		Control Pad ... Move Yoshi 0<br>
		Control Pad while pressing B button ... Move Yoshi 1<br>
		Control Pad while pressing A button ... Move Yoshi 2<br>
		L button ... Make EVA -1 and EVB +1<br>
		R button ... Make EVA +1 and EVB -1<br>
		L button while pressing B button ... Make EVY -1<br>
		R button while pressing B button ... Make EVY +1<br>
		(EVA = coefficient for 1st (upper) object of alpha blend; EVB = coefficient for 2nd (lower) object of alpha blend; EVY = coefficient for change in luminosity.)<br>
