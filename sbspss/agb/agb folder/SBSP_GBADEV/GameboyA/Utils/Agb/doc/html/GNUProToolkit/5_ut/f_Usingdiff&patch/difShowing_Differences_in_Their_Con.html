<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">Usually, when you are looking at the differences between files, you will also
want to see the parts of the files near the lines that differ, to help you
understand exactly what has changed. These nearby parts of the files are called the <I>context</I>.
<P>
GNU </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> provides two output formats that show context around the differing lines: <I>context format</I> and <I>unified format </I>(for more, see </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difContext_Format.html">Context Format</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difUnified_Format.html">Unified Format</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">). It can optionally show in which function or section of the file the
differing lines are found (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difShowing_Which_Sections_Differenc.html">Showing Which Sections Differences Are in</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> and </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difShowing_Alternate_File_Names.html">Showing Alternate File Names</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">. 
<P>
If you are distributing new versions of files to other people in the form of </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> output, you should use one of the output formats that show context so that
they can apply the diffs even if they have made small changes of their own to the
files. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> can apply the diffs in this case by searching in the files for the lines of
context around the differing lines; if those lines are actually a few lines away
from where the </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> says they are, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> can adjust the line numbers accordingly and still apply the </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">diff</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> correctly. See </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="difApplying_Imperfect_Patches.html">Applying Imperfect Patches</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> for more information on using </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">patch</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"> to apply imperfect diffs.
