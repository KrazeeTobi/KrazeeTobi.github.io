<br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A <i>breakpoint</i> makes
your program stop whenever a certain point in the program is reached. For
each breakpoint, you can add conditions to control in finer detail whether
your program stops. You can set breakpoints with the </font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>break</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>
command and its variants (see <font color="#008000"><a href="gdbSetting_breakpoints.html">Setting
breakpoints</a></font>) to specify the place where your program should
stop by line number, function name or exact address in the program.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In languages with exception
handling (such as GNU C++), you can also set breakpoints where an exception
is raised (see <font color="#008000"><a href="gdbBreakpoints_and_exceptions.html">Setting
catchpoints</a></font>).</font></font>
<p><font size=+1><font face="Times New Roman">In HP-UX SunOS 4.x, SVR4,
and Alpha OSF/1 configurations, you can set breakpoints in shared libraries
before the executable is run. There is a minor limitation on HP-UX systems:
you must wait until the executable is run in order to set breakpoints in
shared library routines that are not called directly by the program (for
example, routines that are arguments in a </font><tt>pthread_create call</tt><font face="Times New Roman">).</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A <i>watchpoint</i> is a
special breakpoint that stops your program when the value of an expression
changes. You must use a different command to set watchpoints (see <font color="#008000"><a href="gdbSetting_watchpoints.html">Setting
watchpoints</a></font>), but aside from that, you can manage a watchpoint
like any other breakpoint: you enable, disable, and delete both breakpoints
and watchpoints using the same commands.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A <i>catchpoint</i> is another
special breakpoint that stops your program when a certain kind of event
occurs, such as the throwing of a C++ exception or the loading of a library.
As with watchpoints, you use a different command to set a catchpoint (see
<font color="#008000"><a href="gdbBreakpoints_and_exceptions.html">Setting
catchpoints</a></font>), but aside from that, you can manage a catchpoint
like any other breakpoint. (To stop when your program receives a signal,
use the handle command; see <a href="gdbSignals.html">Signals</a>.)</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>GDB assigns a number to each
breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint when you create it; these numbers
are successive integers starting with one. In many of the commands for
controlling various features of breakpoints you use the breakpoint number
to say which breakpoint you want to change. Each breakpoint may be <i>enabled</i>
or <i>disabled</i>; if disabled, it has no effect on your program until
you enable it again.</font></font>
