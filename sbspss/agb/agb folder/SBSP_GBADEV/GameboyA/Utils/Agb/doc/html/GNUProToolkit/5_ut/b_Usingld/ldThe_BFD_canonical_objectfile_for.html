greatest potential for loss of information occurs when there is the least
overlap between the information provided by the source format, that stored
by the canonical format, and that needed by the destination format. A brief
description of the canonical form may help you understand which kinds of
data you can count on preserving across conversions.</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Information stored on a
per-files basis includes target machine architecture, particular implementation
format type, a demand pageable bit, and a write protected bit. Information

file would have both the demand pageable bit and the write protected text
bit set. The byte order of the target is stored on a per-file basis, so
that big- and little-endian object files may be used with one another.</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Each section in the input

the object file, size and alignment information, various flags, and pointers
into other BFD data structures.</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Each symbol contains a pointer
to the information for the object file which originally defined it, its
name, its value, and various flag bits. When a BFD back end reads in a
symbol table, it relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base
of the section where they were defined.</FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Doing this ensures that each
symbol points to its containing section. Each symbol also has a varying
amount of hidden private data for the BFD back end. Since the symbol points
to the original file, the private data format for that symbol is accessible.

can operate on a collection of symbols of wildly different formats without
problems.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Normal global and simple
local symbols are maintained on output, so an output file (no matter its
format) will retain symbols pointing to functions and to global, static,
and common variables. Some symbol information is not worth retaining; in
</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>a.out</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>,
type information is stored in the symbol table as long symbol names.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This information would be
use-less to most COFF debuggers; the linker has command line switches to
allow users to throw it away.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>There is one word of type
information within the symbol, so if the format supports symbol type information
within symbols (for example, COFF, IEEE, Oasys) and the type is simple
enough to fit within one word (nearly everything but aggregates), the information
will be preserved.</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Each canonical BFD relocation
record contains a pointer to the symbol to relocate to, the offset of the
data to relocate, the section the data is in, and a pointer to a relocation
type descriptor. Relocation is performed by passing messages through the
relocation type descriptor and the symbol pointer. Therefore, relocations
can be performed on output data using a relocation method that is only
available in one of the input formats. For instance, Oasys provides a byte
relocation format. A relocation record requesting this relocation type
would point indirectly to a routine to perform this, so the relocation
may be performed on a byte being written to a 68k COFF file, even though
68k COFF has no such relocation type.</FONT></FONT>

<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><B>line numbers</B></FONT></FONT></I></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Object formats can contain,
for debugging purposes, some form of mapping between symbols, source line
numbers, and addresses in the output file. These addresses have to be relocated
along with the symbol information. Each symbol with an associated list
of line number records points to the first record of the list. The head
of a line number list consists of a pointer to the symbol, which allows
finding out the address of the function whose line number is being described.
The rest of the list is made up of pairs: offsets into the section and
line numbers. Any format which can simply derive this information can pass
it successfully between formats (COFF, IEEE and Oasys).</FONT></FONT></UL>
