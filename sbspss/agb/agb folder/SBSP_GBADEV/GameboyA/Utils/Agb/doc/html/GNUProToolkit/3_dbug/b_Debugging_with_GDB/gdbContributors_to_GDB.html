to GDB&nbsp;</font></font></font></b>
<hr SIZE=6 WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Richard Stallman was the
original author of GDB, and of many other GNU programs. Many others have
contributed to its development.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The following documentation
attempts to credit major contributors. One of the virtues of free software
is that everyone is free to contribute to it; with regret, we cannot actually
acknowledge everyone here. The file ‘</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=+0>ChangeLog</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>’
in the GDB distribution approximates a blow-by-blow account. Changes much
prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><i>Plea</i>:</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Additions to this documentation
are particularly welcome. If you or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded)
have been unfairly omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>So that they may not regard
their long labor as thankless, we particularly thank those who shepherded
GDB through major releases: Stan Shebs (releases 4.1.4, 4.1.5, 4.1.6 and
4.1.7), Fred Fish (releases 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9), Stu Grossman
and John Gilmore (releases 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, and 4.4), John Gilmore (releases
4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, and 3.9); Jim Kingdon (releases 3.5, 3.4, and 3.3);
and Randy Smith (releases 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0). As major maintainer of GDB
for some period, each contributed significantly to the structure, stability,
and capabilities of the entire debugger.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Richard Stallman, assisted
at various times by Peter TerMaat, Chris Hanson, and Richard Mlynarik,
handled releases through 2.8.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Michael Tiemann is the author
of most of the GNU C++ support in GDB, with significant additional contributions
from Per Bothner. James Clark wrote the GNU C++ demangler. Early work on
C++ was by Peter TerMaat (who also did much general update work leading
to release 3.0).</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>GDB 4 uses the BFD subroutine
library to examine multiple object-file formats; BFD was a joint project
of David V. Henkel-Wallace, Rich Pixley, Steve Chamberlain, and John Gilmore.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>David Johnson wrote the original
COFF support; Pace Willison did the original support for encapsulated COFF.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1><font face="Times New Roman">Adam de Boor and Bradley
Davis contributed the ISI Optimum V support. Per Bothner, Noboyuki Hikichi,
and Alessandro Forin contributed MIPS support. Jean-Daniel Fekete contributed
Sun 386i support. Chris Hanson improved the HP9000 support. Noboyuki Hikichi
and Tomoyuki Hasei contributed Sony/News OS 3 support. David Johnson contributed
Encore Umax support. Jyrki Kuoppala contributed Altos 3068 support. Jeff
Law contributed HP PA and SOM support. Keith Packard contributed NS32K
support. Doug Rabson contributed Acorn Risc Machine support. Bob Rusk contributed
Harris Nighthawk CXUX support. Chris Smith contributed Convex support (and
Fortran debugging). Jonathan Stone contributed Pyramid support. Michael
Tiemann contributed SPARC support. Tim Tucker contributed support for the
Gould
NP1 and Gould Powernode. Pace Willison contributed Intel 386 support. Jay
Vosburgh</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">contributed
Symmetry support.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Rich Schaefer and Peter Schauer
helped with support of SunOS shared libraries.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jay Fenlason and Roland McGrath
ensured that GDB and GAS agree about several machine instruction sets.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Patrick Duval, Ted Goldstein,
Vikram Koka and Glenn Engel helped develop remote debugging. Intel Corporation
and Wind River Systems contributed remote debugging modules for their products.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Brian Fox is the author of
the readline libraries providing command-line editing and command history.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Andrew Beers of SUNY Buffalo
wrote the language-switching code, the Modula-2 support, and contributed
the Languages chapter of this manual.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Fred Fish wrote most of the
support for Unix System Vr4. He also enhanced the command-completion support
to cover C++ overloaded symbols.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Hitachi America, Ltd. sponsored
the support for Hitachi microprocessors.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Kung Hsu, Jeff Law, and Rick
Sladkey added support for hardware watchpoints.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1><font face="Times New Roman">Stu Grossman wrote </font><tt>gdbserver</tt><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Michael Snyder added support
for tracepoints.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jim Kingdon, Peter Schauer,
Ian Taylor, and Stu Grossman made nearly innumerable bug fixes and cleanups
throughout GDB.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The following people at the
Hewlett-Packard Company contributed support for the PA-RISC 2.0 architecture,
HP-UX 10.20, 10.30, and 11.0 (narrow mode), HP’s implementation of kernel
threads, HP’s a C++ compiler, and the terminal user interface: Ben Krepp,
Richard Title, John Bishop, Susan Macchia, Kathy Mann, Satish Pai, India
Paul, Steve Rehrauer, and Elena Zannoni. Kim Haase provided HP-specific
information in this documentation.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Cygnus Solutions has sponsored
GDB maintenance and much of its development since 1991.</font></font>
