to report bugs</FONT></FONT></B>

<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A number
of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products. If you obtained
GDB from a support organization, we recommend you contact that organization
first.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>You can find contact information
for many support companies and individuals in the file ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>etc/SERVICE</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’
in the GNU Emacs distribution.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In any event, we also recommend
that you send bug reports for GDB to one of these addresses:</FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>bug-gdb@prep.ai.mit.edu</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>{ucbvax|mit-eddie|uunet}!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gdb</FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Do not send bug reports
to</I></B> ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>info-gdb</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’,
<B><I>or to</I></B> ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>help-gdb</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’,
<B><I>or to any newsgroups</I></B>. Most users of GDB do not want to receive
bug reports. Those that do have arranged to receive ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>bug-gdb</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The mailing list ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>bug-gdb</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’
has a newsgroup ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>gnu.gdb.bug</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’
which serves as a repeater. The mailing list and the newsgroup carry exactly
the same messages. Often people think of posting bug reports to the newsgroup
instead of mailing them. This appears to work, but it has one problem which
can be crucial: a newsgroup posting often lacks a mail path back to the
sender. Thus, if we need to ask for more information, we may be unable
to reach you. For this reason, it is better to send bug reports to the
mailing list. As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>GNU Debugger Bugs</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>Free Software Foundation
Inc.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The fundamental principle
of reporting bugs usefully is this: <B><I>report all the facts</I></B>.
If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it out, state it!</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Often people omit facts because
they think they know what causes the problem and assume that some details
do not matter. Thus, you might assume that the name of the variable you
use in an example does not matter. Well, probably it does not, but one
cannot be sure. Perhaps the bug is a stray memory reference which happens
to fetch from the location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps,
if the name were different, the contents of that location would fool the
debugger into doing the right thing despite the bug. Play it safe and give
a specific, complete example. That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Keep in mind that the purpose
of a bug report is to enable us to fix the bug if it is new to us. Therefore,
always write your bug reports on the assumption that the bug has not been
reported previously.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Sometimes people give a few
sketchy facts and ask, “Does this ring a bell?” Those bug reports are useless,
and we urge everyone <I>to refuse to respond to them</I> except to chide
the sender to <B><I>report bugs properly</I></B>.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>To enable us to fix the bug,
you should include all the following things.</FONT></FONT>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The version of GDB. GDB announces
it if you start with no arguments; you can also print it at any time using
</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>show version</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Without this, we will not
know whether there is any point in looking for the bug in the current version
of GDB.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The type of machine you
are using, and the operating system name and version number.</FONT></FONT>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>What compiler (and its version)
was used to compile GDB—e.g., “gcc–2.0”.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>What compiler (and its version)
was used to compile the program you are debugging—e.g., “gcc–2.0”.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The command arguments you gave
the compiler to compile your example and observe the bug. For example,
did you use ‘</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>-O</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>’?
To guarantee you will not omit something important, list them all. A copy
of the Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If we were to try to guess
the arguments, we would probably guess wrong and then we might not encounter
the bug.</FONT></FONT>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A complete input script, and
all necessary source files, that will reproduce the bug.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A description of what behavior
you observe that you believe is incorrect. For example, “It gets a fatal
signal.” Of course, if the bug is that GDB gets a fatal signal, then we
will certainly notice it. But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong. You might as well not give us
a chance to make a mistake.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Even if the problem you experience
is a fatal signal, you should still say so explicitly. Suppose something
strange is going on, such as, your copy of GDB is out of synch, or you
have encountered a bug in the C library on your system. (This has happened!)
Your copy might crash and ours would not. If you told us to expect a crash,
then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not happening
for us. If you had not told us to expect a crash, then we would not be
able to draw any conclusion from our observations.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If you wish to suggest changes
to the GDB source, send us context diffs. If you even discuss something
in the GDB source, refer to it by context, not by line number.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The line numbers in our
development sources will not match those in your sources. Your line numbers
would convey no useful information to us.</FONT></FONT></UL>
</UL>
</UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The following describes some
things that are not necessary:</FONT></FONT>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A description of the envelope
of the bug.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Often people who encounter
a bug spend a lot of time investigating which changes to the input file
will make the bug go away and which changes will not affect it.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This is often time consuming
and not very useful, because the way we will find the bug is by running
a single example under the debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction
from a series of examples. We recommend that you save your time for something
else.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course, if you can find
a simpler example to report <I>instead</I> of the original one, that is
a convenience for us. Errors in the output will be easier to spot, running
under the debugger will take less time, and so on.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>However, simplification
is not vital; if you do not want to do this, report the bug anyway and
send us the entire test case you used.</FONT></FONT>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A patch for the bug.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A patch for the bug does
help us if it is a good one. But do not omit the necessary information,
such as the test case, on the assumption that a patch is all we need. We
might see problems with your patch and decide to fix the problem another
way, or we might not understand it at all.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Sometimes with a program
as complicated as GDB it is very hard to construct an example that will
make the program follow a certain path through the code.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If you do not send us the
example, we will not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to
verify that the bug is fixed.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>And if we cannot understand
what bug you are trying to fix, or why your patch should be an improvement,
we will not install it. A test case will help us to understand.</FONT></FONT>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A guess about what the bug is
or what it depends on.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Such guesses are usually
wrong.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Even we cannot guess right
about such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.</FONT></FONT></UL>
