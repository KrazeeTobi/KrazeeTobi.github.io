mlibsrc folder------------------------

mpr folder---------------

background.c   Functions that handle background structures.

bgmanage.c     Conducts setting of background, adjustment of parameters and transfers.

ch_alloc.c     Obtains character number. If the character number range that can 
               use this engine is specified, the unused numbers can be obtained. 
        
datatrans.c    Functions for data transfer.  Carries out data transfer at once when a 
               data transfer is registered and transfer function is called.  There 
               are DMA and rectangle area transfers.

mpr.c          There are initializations and V Blank Functions that should be called 
               at the beginning of the loop.

node.c         Besides defining the node structure, this conducts analysis of the initial 
               stage of the node and calls the node evaluation function.

node_animation.c Animation Evaluation Functions.
                 Evaluates Switch, MultiSwitch, Scale, Rotation, Move, Offset,
                 Flipbool, and PaletteAnimation
               
node_background.c  Evaluation function of Background node.

node_image.c    The image here is the 2D image that has width and height.
                Not only character data, but also BG data and Palette data use this.
                The first address can be obtained by using such information as the size 
                of one image, which image is used, and the coordinates.

node_object.c   Evaluation Function of Object Node.

object.c        Handle object structure.

objmanage.c     Registers object, calculates scaling/rotation, and sorts OAM into an 
                appropriate order.
