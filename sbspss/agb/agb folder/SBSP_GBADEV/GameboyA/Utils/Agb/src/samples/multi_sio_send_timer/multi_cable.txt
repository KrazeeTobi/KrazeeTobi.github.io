How to correctly connect AGB multi-cable (for development)
-------------------------------------------------

Introduced here is how to connect AGB multi-cable (hereinafter "cable") to 
multiple target boards.

(1)
This is a problem particular to target board TS2.  First, turn on the power
of the target board.  While turning on the power of the target board when cable 
is already connected, turn on the power of slaves, starting with the furthest one
in order.  This is because the LCD of the target board may not be displayed.


(2)
Connect the AGB multi-cable (for development) to the 6-pin connector of the 
master AGB.Be sure to connect the connector that is away from branch connector PCB. 
(It does not operate if not connected right.) For slaves, connect the connectors 
that are close to branch connector PCB.

*Caution: As the terminals of the cable for development are exposed, be careful
 not to short circuit the target board.

For the proper connection layout of cable, see the layout in "13.2 16-bit 
Multi-play Communication" in the programming manual for reference.
