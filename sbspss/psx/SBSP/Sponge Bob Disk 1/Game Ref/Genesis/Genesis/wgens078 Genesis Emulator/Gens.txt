(06/04/2000) Changes Gens 0.4 <- Gens 0.39 :
--------------------------------------------
A lot of changes for this new release :

- Gens configuration saved in file ! (finally)
  (You can specify your own file name for special configuration)
- SRAM fixed and entierely implemented (saved in file).
- Mouse cursor now hidden in Full-Screen then you must use
  the right mouse button to access at popup menu  !
- Perfect recovering of sound after 'load state' (only with MZ80 core).
  Saves files are now bigger, but there are compatible with old format.
- DAC (few) noises fixed.
- Some little bugs with VDP DMA fixed.
- Others bugs fixed .....

About 80% (little more) of roms work correctly !
No error messages anymore (like "Starscream core error ...").
If an error occurs, emulation attempt to continue even if can crash.

(01/04/2000) Changes Gens 0.39 <- Gens 0.36 :
---------------------------------------------

  and it corrects some sound bugs !
- Fixed special version auto-detection (Toy Story ...)
- SRAM implemented (Landstaker, Light Crusader ... now work correctly !)

- Sound timing for some games (vector man ...) fixed.
- Fixed switch state shortcut.
- Fixed the stupid bug which exits after setting keys !
- Fixed load state crashes with starscream.
- ...

Joystick support not yet available :(

(21/03/2000) Changes Gens 0.34 <- Gens 0.3 :

  - More roms work fine (about 75% :)
  - Faster than mine !

- Sound is now stopped when clicking on menu or resizing the window ...
- Current directory stored (but not yet in a file, just when you keep gens running)

  implemented but deactivated, it'll be active in the next version !
- DAC works now perfectly (can hear 'SEGA' chord in sonic games :)
- Many many fixes in sound and CPU timings:
  - All chips (68000, Z80, YM2612, PSG ...) are synchronized depending on the
    game type (PAL 50Hz / SECAM 60Hz) and PAL games work at 50 FPS in
    auto-frameskip mode.
  - Fix YM2612 timers.
  - Fix PSG rate.
- Can choose sound sample rate (you must reload the rom for that to take effect !)
- Some little others...

There are some glitches with the DAC speed with some games (just hear the voices in
aladdin, cool-spot, lemmings ...)

(08/03/2000) Changes Gens 0.24 <- Gens 0.2 :

    No more bad colors on some video cards :)
- Fixed the VSRam read and write (vertical scrollings are now okay)
- I'm using RAZE (Richard Mitton richard.mitton@bigfoot.com) z80 emulator instead of MZ80
 (Neil Bradley neil@synthcom.com) due to unworking games with MZ80 (I may not use it correctly).
- Some changes in DMA transfers. (sprites of mario (no commercial) rom are okay).
- Full-Screen now works correctly.
  Full-Screen is faster than Windowed mode, just use it !
- Some others ...

Sorry, once again, the sound is not implemented, may be in the next release !

(08/02/2000) Changes Gens 0.141 <- Gens 0.12 Beta :

- HalfBlur effect added for smooth graphics !

(03/02/2000) Changes Gens 0.12 Beta (Win9X) <- Gens 0.15b (DOS):
----------------------------------------------------------------

First important change: Gens works now under win9X and using DirectX !, Then some bugs appeared
and some roms that worked on Gens 0.15b don't work anymore :(

- Screen size * 1; * 2; * 3; * 4.
- No V-Sync possibility for now.
- Debugger is missing because a lot of work is needed to make it work !
- Save/Load state added !
  I'm using Genecyst format, there are some bugs due to lack of info.
- The transparencies effects due to palette changes during H-Blanking work !

No sound yet !


 -----------------------------------
| What I need to get Gens working ? |
 -----------------------------------

On my machine (Celeron @464 Mhz & 64 Mb), most roms works at 60 FPS or more.
(20 FPS when I use size * 3).

* Minimun Machine

- Pentium 166 (MMX is required for 2xSaI Kreed's engine)
- 16 Mb de Ram
- Video card that supports DirectDraw and 15/16 bpp mode
- Win9X / Win2000
- DirectX 5.0


* Recommended Machine (if you want 60 FPS)

- Pentium II 300 Mhz
- A good video card like tnt or G400 ...
  If you have a bad video card like SIS, Virge ... I recommended strongly you to use Full Screen
- 32 Mb Ram
- Win9X / Win2000
- DirectX 5.0

Compatibility :
---------------

Red5 from the Genesis Project has tested 0-A and T-Z games with Gens v0.6
92% of games work perfectly + 4% are playables with some glitches.
Then 96% of games are playables :)

You can see these results at http://www.genesisproject.co.uk

The compatibility of Gens v0.78b is better. (about 97% of games playables)
