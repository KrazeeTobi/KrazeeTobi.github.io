What's New :
------------

v0.900c- Fixed another sprite priority bug
       - HBlank is supposed to be noticed during VBlank
       - Fixed an IRQ bug that occured between v0.715 and v0.800
       - Fixed a 65816 DPage usage bug that occured between v0.715 and v0.800
       - Rewrote 65816 flag handling system.
       - Optimised SA-1 emulation
       - Optimised the 65816 main loop.
       - Implemented Surround Sound.  It is defaulted off since it seems
         to create some bad static in some games.  Thanks to Crono for
         info!
       - Wrote Interpolation in MMX.  MMX cpu is required.
       - Implemented MMX auto-detection for MMX Interpolation and MMX Copy.
       - Fixed an 224HDMA line bug, thanks to Gary Henderson!
       - Optimised 320x240x16b and 640x480x16b for ARGB cards.
       - Removed Snow
       - Clock option is now visible to anyone.  You can enable the in-game
         clock through the GUI in Config->Options.
       - Altered method of writing to file in Movie Recording mode, hoping
         that it will fix some problems after recording movies for a long
         period of time.
       - Altered data alignment size in source
       - Fixed a VESA2 divide by 0 bug in Banshee cards by checking the
         scanline length instead of setting it immediately.  Thanks to
         Crono for some help!
       - Altered sound echo volume
       - Added sound interpolation based on Crono's code.
         Thanks to Crono for his help!
       - Added an option to turn off sound interpolation for speed
       - Implemented Pitch Modulation, thanks goes to Gary Henderson for
         clarification info!
       - Implemented an option in the GUI (Config->Options) to allow the
         Fast Forward key to act as a toggle (disabled by default)
       - Fixed a bug that prevented high resolution to sometimes not display
         in a 16bit video mode
       - Fixed a game stalling bug when pressing F3 during games that are
         sensitive to changes in the ENVX DSP register (Bomberman Series)
       - Added a hack for the graphic glitches in Dragon Quest 6
       - Fixed up in-game clock in the new gfx 16bit engine
       - Fixed a nasty bug in the ADSR engine.  It was sometimes using
         an incorrect decay value, causing the sound to stick instead
         of fading out
       - Slightly fixed ADSR by completely skipping the attack stage when
         the attack duration is 0
       - Fixed a GAIN decrease->increase bug
       - Implemented a safe recovery feature for those computers that don't
         support the CPUID instruction (used for MMX detection).  If ZSNES
         crashes at the very start, just re-run it.
       - Fixed a fixed color dual windowing bug in the subscreen which
         caused transparency to sometimes shift unexpectedly when the
         background scrolls
       - Implemented 50% Scanlines (Lance McKay's idea) and 25%
         Scanlines (Similar to Snes9x TV-Mode's scanline intensity)
         in 640x480x65536 video mode.  These modes don't work on videocards
         with an ARGB setting yet.
       - Added MMX Support to 50% and 25% Scanlines modes
       - Implemented back buffer clear in MMX
       - .CHT files now saves to the proper save directory
       - Implemented the 2xSaI graphics engine (MMX Only).  Many thanks
         to Kreed for this wonderful engine and source code!
       - Implemented Kreed's Super Eagle engine.  Note that for both
         2xSaI and Super Eagle, you need an MMX processor, enough RAM for
         the new gfx 16bit engine, and also be in 640x480x65536 video mode.
       - Implemented an option to auto-load a .cht file whenever a game
         is loaded.  You can find this option at the bottom of the Cheat
         Window in the GUI.
       - Optimised Non-MMX Interpolation
       - Fixed a bug that caused save states to not save correctly after
         attempting to load a non-existing .cht file
       - Added a Quick SnapShot Key.  You can set this key in the
         Misc -> GameKeys menu in the GUI.  This key allows you to take
         a snapshot with just a press of a key.
       - Implemented .ZIP support.  Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly, Mark Adler,
         and Gilles Vollant for the ZIP routines!
       - Fixed a bug where pressing PageUp/PageDown in the cheat window
         went over by 3 entries.
       - Implemented longer cheat descriptions.  The cheat window and the
         .cht file format had to change a bit, however, ZSNES automatically
         converts any old formats to the new formats when it detects it.
       - Allowed the IRQ to be executed more than once on the same line
         through HIRQ.  Fixes the flickering problems of Doom/Offroad Baja.
       - NMI now executes at line 225 instead of 224.
       - Saving/Loading the state causing the control to stop or skip has
         been fixed again.
       - .ZIP files can now be run from the commandline
       - Implemented an option for ZSNES to automatically save the save data
         approx. 5 seconds after it detects writes to it.  This will not
         work for SuperFX or SA-1 special chip games, however.  This option
         is disabled by default and can be enabled through the option window.
       - Implemented an option in the sound window to re-initialize the sound
         card after every 25-30 seconds.  Hopefully fixes the problems where
         the sound gets staticy after a certain amount of time.
       - Newest Save Slot will now appear as orange in the Save State
         Select (F3) window
       - Fixed a spc700 <-> 65816 sync bug during movie (.ZMV) playback
       - Implemented an option to enable Old Gfx Engine Mode 2 (Accessible
         through the options window in the GUI).  This mode fixes many
         transparency problems in 16bit modes, but can also create some
         and is also at times slower than the original engine.
       - Implemented 640x480x65536 VESA 1.2 support.  Currently supports
         Full Scanlines and Smallscreen modes.  However, it is strongly
         recommended that you only use VESA 1.2 support if your card cannot
         support VESA 2.0 (w/ linear framebuffer) since VESA 1.2 runs slower.
       - Implemented an option to disable Pitch Modulation
       - Sound card is now not re-initialized whenever a state is saved/loaded
         since some sound cards seems to have problems with it.
       - Implemented Single Windowing in the New Gfx 8bit engine, 8x8
         and 16x16 tile modes only
       - Fixed 64k SRAM support when loaded from the GUI
       - Optimised high resolution new gfx modes in 640x480x256
       - Fixed the graphic glitches in x488 snes vertical resolution modes
         in 640x480x256 new gfx mode
       - Optimised 640x480x256 Eagle Engine
       - Fixed the GUI background display bug in the new gfx engine
       - Fixed .SPC capture in the new gfx engine
       - Added an option to start with the newest save state when the game
         is loaded.  It can be enabled in Config->Options window in the GUI
       - Slightly optimised new gfx 8bit engine
       - Fixed several Mode 7 problems in the New Gfx 8bit engine
       - Changed DSP1 variables to use double instead of floats for a small
         speed increase.  Thanks to Gary Henderson for this tip!
       - Fixed up the Mode 7 slowdown bug when the scale ratio becomes small
         in most graphics modes
       - Optimised some Mode 7 transparency modes
       - Implemented EXTBG mode 7 into the newgfx 8bit engine
       - Fixed the 'FIX' feature in the cheat menu.  Seems like it wasn't
         writing any value to memory when it was clicked.
       - Game Genie codes are now defaulted to the 'FIX'ed mode.  Seems like
         most of the codes needs this.
       - Implemented windowing to Mode 7, New Gfx Engine 8bit
       - Added support for .SPC v0.2 format
       - Added an option in zsnes.cfg to disable configuration saving for
         those who want to store zsnes.exe in a read-only storage area
       - Fixed GameKeys display in the GUI for certain keys (such as the
         snes parallel adapter keys)
       - Implemented hi-res mode 7 (vertical expand only).  Currently only
         works in 640x480x256 newgfx engine (w/ Eagle and Scanlines disabled).
       - Fixed an offset per tile mode bug in the new gfx 8bit engine
       - Implemented dual windowing modes into the new gfx 8bit engine
       - New Gfx 8bit engine is now the default graphics engine in 256 color
         modes.  It still lacks sprite windowing and also has some sprite
         flicker issues, but it's overall more stable, faster, and has
         more features.  You can still switch back to the old gfx engine by
         pressing '8'.
       - Looks like Pitch Modulation was causing more sound problems than
         what it's worth.  It's now disabled by default, but you can reenable
         it through the GUI.
       - Added auto save/load state feature where ZSNES will automatically
         loads back the previous state when you last properly exited ZSNES.
         This feature is disabled by default.
       - Compressed the executable using UPX

v0.800c- Fixed up sound speeds.  Timers were computed incorrectly.
       - Fixed a sprite priority bug
       - Fixed up a bug that prevented the gui to be disabled
       - Fixed up SPC capture
       - Fixed a bug when VIRQ is set on the same scanline as NMI
       - Implemented an automatic .IPS patcher.  Just rename your .IPS
         file to the rom filename with the .IPS extension and ZSNES will
         patch the rom realtime without modifying the rom file's contents.
         Thanks to Neill Corlett for most of the .IPS info!
       - Snapshot capture/skip 2 frames option now returns back to
         the proper menu item
       - Fixed a calibration bug with 6/8button joysticks
       - Fixed up display in 640x480x8 new gfx engine
       - Fixed up hi resolution displays in all 640x480x8b modes
       - Fixed up a bug where Mode 7 becomes corrupt after selecting
         Save CFG from the GUI
       - Fixed a memory map bug in lorom DSP1 games
       - Fixed a potential DSP1 crashing bug where a negative value is
         being square rooted
       - Hopefully fixed the modem bug when using an IRQ that is bigger than 7
       - Fixed up an ADSR bug for games that changes ADSR mid-sample
       - Fixed up echo emulation (possibly slowed down emulation)
       - Fixed up a sprite caching bug
       - Fixed up a DSP1 byte check stall bug
       - Implemented a commandline to disable spc700 speed hacks (-7)
         Might help with some compatibility
       - Implemented SA-1 support (most functions emulated)!  Unfortunately,
         it's still buggy.  Thanks to the snes9x team for providing info!
       - Fixed a bug when selecting drive A/B while a disk is not
         in the drive caused a long check sequence
       - Implemented Keyboard support to most of Option, Sound, and GUI
         Option configurations in the GUI
       - Changed sound init code a bit.  Hopefully improves sound card
         compatibility, but might also ruin it.
       - Implemented off by 1 line fix (-9).  This may help compatibility and
         fix some minor graphic glitches, but may also ruin some too.

v0.715 - Fixed a crashing bug when 16bit back window clipping was using
         an undefined windowing clip buffer
       - Added spc program counter check to the spc stall detection to
         reduce false alarms
       - Tweaked IRQ processing a bit
       - ZSNES.CFG and ZGUICFG.DAT are now fixed so that they will use
         the current directory when the SET CMDLINE detection fails
       - Fixed several mode 7 bugs in the new graphic engines
       - Implemented an option to save the configuration files in the
         MISC menu
       - Added a shadow to the in-game text displays
       - Fixed a bug created in v0.700 where pressing F3 while sound
         is disabled crashes zsnes
       - Fixed up player 4 and player 5 so they now work again
       - Fixed up color a bit in the old graphics 16bit engine
       - Added gamma control to 16bit old graphics engine
       - Fixed a cheat code bug where pressing the down key in the
         browser overflows by 3 rows
       - Fixed up a bug where any memory allocation below 48mbit support
         crashes
       - Added out of memory error when loading a file from the gui
       - Fixed a minor off by 1 pixel windowing bug
       - Fixed up memory requirements in the readme.txt.  It seems like
         compiling with C takes up 3.0 more megs.  It shouldn't though.
         An asm only version will be release later without dsp1/ipx support
         unless the reason is figured out.
       NOTE : It seems like IPX mode randomly loses packets in certain
              configurations so IPX isn't recommended to use yet.

v0.700 - Fixed another offset per tile mode bug
       - Fixed up joystick button update rate
       - Fixed a bug that caused sound buffer dump option to crash
       - Fixed a minor sound initialization bug
       - ZSNES now compiles with C code!
       - Fully rewritten commandline parser routines
       - Partially rewritten SET BLASTER/SET CMDLINE detection
       - Implemented partial DSP1 support.  Seems to have some
         precision problems.  Thanks to the snes9x team for the info!
       - Fixed a mode 7 nonrepeat mode off by 1 tile bug
       - Implemented snapshot/increment by 2 frame feature in the F1 menu
         for those interested in producing animations
       - Added variable sound buffer size to reduce static in higher
         sampling rates
       - Changed method of reading the mouse cursor position in the GUI.
         Hopefully, this fixes those mouse crash problems when zsnes is
         run in pure dos and sometimes win95.
       - Added a commandline to disable palette 0 (back color) modification
         in 256 color modes
       - Implemented Turbo Buttons for buttons A,B,X, and Y.  Use the GUI to
         define those keys
       - Added the ability to toggle Turbo Change speed to 30hz instead
         of 60hz in the Options menu
       - Started C4 chip emulation.  Nothing is playable yet.
       - Fixed up SET CMDLINE detection.  Hopefully, zsnes.cfg and
         zguicfg.dat will now end up in the correct directory.
       - Started Modem Support (direct modem to modem).
         DOS-Compatible modem required!  Thanks to Dark Force for helping
         out on getting a bug that kept USR's and other modems from working!
         Also thanks to The Minder for a lot of help testing!
         Note : Modem mode isn't free of bugs
       - Added in-game chat key to the GUI keys for modem/net support.
         Currently defaulted to 't'
       - Forgot to add EMMS after any MMX routines that seems to cause
         any FPU instructions to crash
       - Fixed an interrupt re-enable bug in the Gamepad Pro code which
         seems to have eliminated the locking bugs when it's not set on
         GrIP mode
       - Implemented keys to adjust Frame Rate up or down during
         gameplay.  You can define them through the GUI under Gamekeys
       - Implemented keys to slide the volume level up or down during
         gameplay
       - Fixed a small HDMA screw up bug when using Save/Load states
         which caused the screen to flicker once in many games
       - Finally fix up 48mbit mapper support!  Many thanks to Dark Force,
         Mike Gilroy, and Frank Hughes for a lot of help on this!
       - Several fixes to register 4211h
       - Rewrote IRQ timing handler (not perfect, but better)
       - Implemented Fossil Driver support to the modem support.
       - Fixed an IRQ reenable bug
       - Increased default cycles a bit
       - Fixed some major mode 7 rotation bugs
       - Added support for uninterleaved 48mbit roms
       - Added a FIX option to the cheat code to correct incorrectly
         converted codes
       - Implemented Mode 7 horizontal flip
       - Implemented primitive IPX support.  It is very primitive at
         the moment and may not work since it isn't really tested much.
       - Optimised some 65816 direct page addressing modes
       NOTE : .ZMV (Movie) files recorded under v0.635 has good potential
       on becoming obsolete in this version because of the timing changes
       NOTE : IPX support and Modem support may be buggy since it hasn't
       been tested on multiple types of connections yet.

v0.635 - Sidewinder fix options are now swapped since the majority seems
         to work better with the other sidewinder routine.
       - Implemented EXTBG mode7 in 256 color old graphics engine.
       - Fixed a DSP Sound bug where some sound effects weren't played in
         certain games
       - Tweaked joystick routines again
       - Fixed up a bug where sometimes loading a game after playing
         another game screws up emulation
       - Optimised 640x480x8, 512x384x8, and 512x384x16 video modes
       - Implemented EXTBG mode7 in 65536 color old graphics engine.
       - Fixed an offset per tile mode range clipping bug
       - Fixed up offset per tile mode in new gfx 8bit engine
       - Fixed a bug which caused a crash when a state is loaded while
         playing/recording a movie file
       - Optimised new gfx 16bit non-transparency mode
       - Implemented SPC700 stall detection/recovery attempt
       - Fixed up a new header detection bug in v0.625
       - Modified memory allocation routines.  Hope this fixes those
         random crash problems that some people seem to have
       - Fixed a sound bug where the song leaks after it ends,
         sometimes producing an unwanted beep
       - Optimised new gfx 16bit transparency modes
       - Multiple DSP sound bug fixes
       - Implemented transparencies in high res 16x8 tiles
       - Implemented a command line to disable the sound DSP (-dd).  Use
         -s and -dd if you want spc700 emulation to be enabled without sound
         to improve compatibility
       - Fixed a bug where joystick support makes the emulation slow
       - Had to remove some memory allocated variables and convert them
         to arrays since they were causing random crashes on specific
         computers.
       - Fixed up pressing save state/load state in game so that it doesn't
         clear any key presses

v0.625 - Fixed up a major speed drop bug by just adding some empty space.
         Most likely a cache/alignment problem.
       - Used an older version of wdosx because the new version sometimes
         crashes during compiling
       - Executable is now uncompressed.  It's 3 megs, but it provides a
         much faster start up time.
       - Seems like EPACK can only support a maximum of 6 commandlines.
         Fixed after executable is decompressed
       - Fixed a bug where buttons 7 and 8 of 8 button joystick support
         sticks once pressed
       - Swapped button 5/6 and 7/8 in the default joystick configuration
         for 8 button joysticks
       - It seems like 16bit HDMA < 5 was causing problems with some
         sound cards.  It now reroutes back to 8bit DMA like how v0.400
         did it.
       - Implemented a new offset per tile mode engine into the old
         graphics engine (mostly transferred from 8bit newgfx engine)
       - Implemented Horizontal offset per tile mode in both 8bit and
         16 bit old graphics engine (Mode2/8x8 only)
       - Implemented Horizontal offset per tile mode in 8bit new graphics
         engine (Mode2/8x8 only)
       - Tweaked sidewinder routines.  Hopefully, this will help those who
         have troubles using sidewinder support
       - For those with sidewinder pads who has troubles with the tweaked
         routines, a 'Sidewinder Fix' option in the GUI is added in the
         Config/Options menu
       - Commandline -i now uninterleaves an incorrectly interleaved rom
       - Tweaked GamePad Pro routines.  Not exactly sure if this will help
         those with 2 GPP joysticks though
       - Fixed up sticky buttons in the GUI cheat menu when no cheat
         codes are present
       - Fixed a bug where using -1 and -2 in the commandlines didn't
         activate the joystick movement/buttons
       - Fixed an offset per tile mode wrapping bug
       - ZSNES will now not crash when zsnes.cfg and zguicfg.dat are
         write protected files
       - Fixed up the GUI when 239 y resolution is used in the game
       - Optimised some minor mode 7 routines
       - SNES Header display in the GUI now displays the filename for
         blank headers.  This will fail for headers with garbled header
         names
       - Inserted an extra reminder in the cheat menu
       - Implemented 239 y-resolution support for .PCX snapshots
       - Implemented 239 y-resolution support for .BMP snapshots
       - Added multiple .SPC saves (Up to 10 saves only)
       - Save State Selection Menu (default F3) now highlights used
         state boxes in red
       - Tweaked 2player/6button/8button joystick routines a bit
       - Fixed a cheat code bug where pressing TAB adds an extra character
         at the end of the address
       - Removed the blank line from the .PCX and .BMP snapshots
       - Implemented Joystick Calibration for non digital joysticks
       - Fixed a bug where parallel port LPT2 player 2 wasn't selectable
         in v0.605
       - Stabilized the joystick code a bit
       - Fixed up a cheat code bug where using a PAR code that accesses
         RAM doesn't freeze when the .cht file is loaded
       - Added a small delay to play a note when a key on is issued from
         the sound DSP.  Not sure if this fixes anything though
       - Fixed some sound compatibility problems when RESET is used
       - Implemented Movie Record/Playback support.  Read GUINotes.txt
         for details.
       - Added a small detection for long filenames and prevented users from
         selecting it when it isn't detected
       - Fixed a bug where max frame skip didn't save
       - Fix a timing bug where running a game off the gui ran 1 less
         line in the 65816 than running off the commandline
       - Implemented FPS at start option in the Config/Options menu
       - Fixed a bug in the newgfx16bit engine where 8bpp tiles displayed
         incorrectly
       - Reduced the filesize by 1200k through many changes in the code
         (filesize is now 2.0 megs)
       - Fixed some VIRQ bugs that caused certain games to crash
       - Added DMA area execution for IRET
       - Added a 'Bugs Section' in the readme.txt
       - Show all extensions is now disabled when snes header view is
         selected in the GUI
       - Implemented partial Direct Color mode in Mode 7 (no transparencies
         yet, only works in 16bit old gfx engine)
       - Improved header detection a bit
       - Fixed up a sprite bug in games which changes the address in
         the middle of the screen

v0.605 - Fixed up a FPS display bug when switching between auto frame rate
         and manual frame rate in the GUI
       - Cheat Codes can now be toggled ON/OFF by double clicking on them
       - Tab key now switches from the Cheat Code enter box to the
         Description box
       - Fixed a Save State/Load State bug in the menu where it saved
         in the load directory instead of the save directory
       - Implemented 8button joystick support (Not tested)
       - Implemented an option in the .cfg file to enable reversed
         stereo sound (ReverseStereo)
       - Implemented an option in the .cfg file to share Player 1 and
         Player 2 controls with Player 3 and Player 4's controls.  This
         option allows you to use 2 devices (Joystick and Keyboard) for
         both player 1 and player 2, but this also disables MultiTap
         support. (Pl34to12Share)
       - Added Reverse Stereo to the GUI under config/sound
       - Added Player 3, Player 4 to use as Player 1, Player 2 in the
         GUI under config/options
       - Compiled under a new version of wdosx.  Hope this doesn't cause
         any problems

v0.601 - Fixed up a sound card deinit bug that sometimes caused ZSNES to
         crash in certain sound cards
       - Disabled Autoinit mode when a low sampling rate is used in 8bit
         sound.  Probabily was also causing problems in some cards

       Note : The offset per tile mode in the 16bit oldgfx engine seems
         to randomly crash sometimes for an unknown reason.  If 16bit mode
         crashes for you and 8bit doesn't, press the '0' key in 16bit mode
         to disable that mode.

v0.600 *** ADDED A NEW MEMBER TO THE ZSNES TEAM! ***
       Welcome Pharos to the team, his role is currently a coding assitant.
       So far, he helped us objectize the zsnes source code which greatly
       helped in the compile time, provided assembly help, and helped us
       prepare on linking C code to zsnes (not completely there yet).

       Note : It is strongly recommended to not use the 16-bit new
              graphics engine yet because of bugs and speed concerns.  It
              is enabled only in 320x240x65536 for those who are interested.

       - Added partial 65816 execution in the DMA registers (doesn't seem to
         fix mucht due to some other problem) Thanks to Alucard for this
         info!  This also slowed down emulation a bit.
       - Implemented sprite priority correction into the new graphics engine
       - Implemented mosaic into the new graphics engine
       - Implemented true 512 horizontal resolution into new graphics
         engine (both 16x8 and 16x16 tile modes)
       - Implemented interlaced 448 vertical resolution into new graphics
         engine
       - Implemented offset per tile mode into the new graphics engine
         (Mode 2/Vertical only).  More accurate compared to the old
         graphics engine. (seems to be a bug where the game gets very
         slow sometimes though)
       - Started 16-bit new graphics engine
       - Implemented sprite priority correction in 16bit new gfx engine
       - Implemented palette raster effects in 16bit new gfx engine
       - Fixed a minor bg enable/disable bug in the new gfx engine
       - Multiple SPC700 bug fixes.  More games run now!
       - Implemented SPCPlay sound engine into zsnes :
           - Echo & FIR Filter Support (Slowed down emulation, but
             gives better sound) Thanks to feenix65 for info on FIR Filter!
           - Volume fixes
           - Rewrote ADSR/GAIN engine
           - Added Adjustable Volume through the commandline and zsnes.cfg
           - 16000 and 32000 extra sampling rates
           - Many other bug fixes
       - Fixed a minor HDMA bug
       - Fixed an old style joystick read bug that prevented the joypad
         from functioning in certain games
       - Several optimisations on Echo & FIR Filter
       - Several Sound DSP Fixes
       - Temporarily fixed a V-latch bug in some games that don't update the
         display at every frame
       - Add/Removed some game hacks for compatibility
       - Modified Song Start Search in .spc capture.  Should be much better now.
       - Fixed a sprite window clipping bug where it was used when it's not
         supposed to be.
       - Modified memory allocation technique in zsnes.  This should now
         eliminate some random crash errors.  Thanks to Y0SHi for this
         info!
       - -c now does full screen instead of small screen in 640x480 modes.
         For small screen, use -cc
       - Fixed a back area 1/2 addition bug which caused the background
         to be sometimes darker than usual
       - Fixed a mode 7 transparency bug
       - Added 8-bit stereo sound and 8-bit sound high speed mode support
         (high speed mode support is just the implementation of 8bit 44100khz
          or 22050khz stereo)  Thanks to Crono for a lot of help on this!
       - Fixed up sound blaster deinit code
         Thanks again to Crono!
       - Wrote an entirely new GUI :
           - Mouse driven GUI/Menu Based
           - Full Keyboard Support in all the Quick (Arrow Menu), Load,
             and Cheat menu items
           - Ability to display load names under 8.3 filename format, snes
             header name, and win95 long filenames
           - Support for Save State, Load State, and Select State through
             menu items
           - Quick Load Menu (Arrow menu) which allows you to quickly load
             the last 10 games loaded
           - Ability to Freeze or Clear the Quick Load Menu
           - An Options menu which allows you to configure settings such
             as video mode, sound settings, frame skip, etc.
           - Added the ability to customize the game keys such as
             the save state key, misc toggles, etc.
           - Ability to use those keys as joystick buttons
           - Customizeable background palette displacement
           - Several minor GUI customization features
           - Ability to quickly exit/enter the GUI with the right
             mouse button (Disabled by default)
           - Ability to Enter Game Genie, Pro Action Replay, or Game
             Finger Cheat Codes
           - Ability to browse the cheat codes and Toggle or Remove
             the codes
           - Ability to Save/Load Cheat Codes (saves them as .CHT files
             in the same directory as the .SRM/.ZST files)
           - Ability to Select Input Devices for each joypad
           - Ability to Define Keys/Button configuration for each joypad
           - Joypad can now move in the GUI (disabled by default)
           - Added some future reserve menus (Netplay, Cheat Search Engine)
             But they are NOT implemented in zsnes yet.
       - Fixed a bug when clearing the screen in 640x480x65536
       - Implemented full add, half add, full subtract, and
         half subtract into the new 16bit graphics engine
         Not sure why, but some transparency modes are actually slower
         than the old engine.  Most likely flushing the cache a lot
         somewhere.
       - Implemented background transparencies into new 16bit graphics engine
         (implemented incorrectly at the moment.  Some transparency modes
         also is slower than the old graphics engine, but that will change
         in the future)
       - Implemented fixed color transparencies (very incorrect because of
         lack of windowing)
       - Fixed a minor bug in the fast forward routines
       - Rewrote most of the 65816 speed hack.  It should now be a lot
         more friendly with games (reduced graphic glitches/increased
         compatibility).
       - Fixed a bug in Mode7 with Windowing and Transparency enabled
       - Allowed 16bit HDMA sound blaster values less than 5 to be used.
         Not exactly sure if this works though.
       - Implemented Mouse Disable Command Line (-j)
       - Rewrote Input Device Routines (Keyboard, Joystick, SNES Mouse,
         and Super Scope Handlers)
       - Added GamePad Pro Support (Don't know if it works on a standard
         GrIP system though).  Thanks to Marius Fodor for the code!
       - Added Snes Parallel Port Support for both LPT1 and LPT2.
         Thanks to Karl for the code!
       - Added MultiTap (Multiplayer 5) Support!  (Only up to 4 players at
         the moment though)
       - Joystick Port 209h support
       - Fixed an overflow caching bug in the new gfx engine where a few games
         run very slow
       - Added some C -> ASM converted DSP1 functions.  Some functions
         were unable to convert properly so no DSP1 games are playable until
         the actual C code is in
       - Executable is now compressed using epack
       - Implemented sprite transparency into the 16-bit new graphics engine
       - Implemented mode7 transparency into the 16-bit new graphics engine
       - Higher memory requirements (Sorry, but this is unavoidable as long
         as ZSNES keeps expanding)
       - Implemented Echo Disable in the zsnes.cfg for those who want some
         extra speed in return for lost sound quality
       - A bunch of other fixes that we forgot to list

v0.400 - Fixed a dual windowing bug in mode 7 in 65536 color mode
       - Re-added FPU Copy due to a demand
       - Implemented MMX Copy.  Use -om to enable.  Thanks to Angels Holocaust
         for this info!
       - Fixed a bug when writing to .bmp files
       - Added (buggy) SuperFX support (9.5MB memory required)
         Special thanks to the snes9x team for all the info and help!
       - Fixed up sprite windowing.  Should hopefully be correct now
       - Added a commandline to show all file extensions through the GUI
         Use -sa to enable
       - Added Noise to the Sound DSP
       - Added a Fast Forward key.  Use the Tilde Key (~) located at the
         top-left of your keyboard.
       - Added Sprite Priority Correction
       - Fixed a tile caching bug that caused some tile corruption
       - Fixed a 65816 bug in XCE on the x flag.  Thanks to ]SiMKiN[ for this!
       - Implemented Interleaved format and a simple auto detection.  In case
         autodetect fails, use -i.  Thanks to feenix65 for this info!
       - Improved header detection.  Should now work better with demos
         and games with weird filesizes
       - Added a new graphics engine in 256 color mode.  It should be much
         faster in areas that don't use mode 7, but lacks a lot of features
         such as windowing, mosaic, and sprite priorities so it is disabled
         by default.  It can be enabled by pressing 8 during gameplay.
         (~40-100% faster)
       - Optimised Mode 7 in 256 color mode
       - Implemented dual windowing to color window clipping
       - Fixed several color window clipping bugs
       - Added full resolution screenshot capture in 640x480x65536 mode
         To activate while in that mode, hold backspace and press F1

       - Added NewGfx to zsnes.cfg which determines if the new graphics
         engine is enabled at start
       - Added CopyMethod to zsnes.cfg which can default the copy method
         as either fpu copy or mmx copy
       - Allowed systems with 5.5MB of RAM free to load 2mbit roms
       - Fixed sidewinder support when sound is set at a high sampling
         rate.  Thanks to Marius Fodor for the source!

       - Added Save SPC Data which saves the contents of the SPC700/DSP
         of the beginning of the next song (Future Reserved)
       - Add Sound Buffer Dump which dumps the decompressed sound buffer
         as raw pcm.  This can become quite inaccurate due to the way how
         zsnes stores its decompressed sounds.
       - Added MenuItem Sound Buffer Dump into the F1 Menu
       - Added MenuItem Save SPC Data into the F1 Menu
       - Added a key to disable offset mode.  Press 0 key to
         activate/deactivate
       - Added small screen support in 640x480VESA2 modes.  This mode
         should be much faster for those who use 640x480.
         Use the -c commandline to enable this when in 640x480.
       - Added an option for centered small screen.  Use the -cc commandline.
       - Fixed up 320x240x65536 support for ARGB cards again.  It now
         should be working. (No, seriously!)
       - Removed some static from the sound.

       - DSP : Fixed a divide by 0 bug when key on is set without any sound
         variables initialized
       - Increased default cycles executed in FastROM.
       - Added ZSNES.FAQ .  Read this if you have troubles!
       - Added a key to disable/enable Windowing.  Press 9 to
         activate this.
       - Implemented EAGLE algorithm in 640x480x256 video mode.  Use
         -y to enable.  Thanks to A CoolMan for the algorithm!
         Later on, we'll implement his code which has MMX acceleration!
       - Implemented FPU copy.  Use -o to enable.  Used only when copying
         buffer to video in 320x240 vesa2 modes.
       - Re-wrote Windowing routines for speed and expandability
       - Added Dual Windowing on BGs in all logic modes
       - Added Dual Windowing on Sprites
       - Added some minor stuff to the header displayer
       - Added partial offset per tile mode. (Mode 2/Vertical/8x8)

       - Improved color intensity in the back area
       - Fixed a sram directory bug where the save state didn't save in the save
         directory when the game is specified from the command line
       - Fixed a keyboard bug when left-shift is selected as a key.
         Thanks to Pharos for help on this!
       - Some DMA speedups
       - Some optimisations to OAM/VRAM write
       - Sorry, but SuperFX emulation is disabled for this public version.

       - Hopefully fixed 6-button joystick support.
       - Fixed a little memory overflow bug which caused some games to not
         work
       - Forgot to clear NMI wait substitute variables when another game
         is loaded from the GUI

         you want to go back to v0.300 sound engine, use -x as a command line
       - Added Cursor Mode Button to the Super Scope.  Never thought it was
         necessary until recently.  Use the =/+ key.

         crashing/rebooting problems under dos.  Thanks to Sardu for some
         help on this!
       - Fixed some VRAM accessing bugs
       - Several fixes to the sound DSP
       - Optimised SPC700 a bit
       - Implemented primitive Mode 5, 512 horizontal resolution.  To get
         full potential of this mode, use 640x480 resolutions except for
