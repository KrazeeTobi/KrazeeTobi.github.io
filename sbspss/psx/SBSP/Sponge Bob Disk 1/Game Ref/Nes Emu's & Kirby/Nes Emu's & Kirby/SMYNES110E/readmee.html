<p>Introduction of Nintendo Family Computer :</p>

<p>&nbsp; The Nintendo Family Computer was published during the 80s by Japanese Nintendo 
company as a family game computer. At that time, the field of computer games were 
intensively competed with one another. With various well representive works published , 
the Nintendo Family Computer became the most active family computer during the 80s and 
90s. Basically, the structure of Nintendo machine is not complicate after all. It uses the 
6502 CPU. In the aspect of sound, it uses two square waves, one triangle wave, one noise 
and one PCM (two types). However, game suppliers were asking for the perfection towards 
Nitendo games, and most of them added the extra sound chips into game cards. If those extra 
sound chips were not emulated, then that particular games would appear the problem of 
absence of sound. Not only that, various Nintendo games also included hardware equipments 
while they were published. For example, &quot;mahjong joystick&quot;, &quot;swipping card 
machine&quot;, &quot;stuff puff motorbike&quot;, &quot;shrewmouse joystick&quot;, 
&quot;dancing board&quot; and &quot;ray gum&quot;, etc. If these peripheral equipments 
were not emulated, then the games might not be able to function properly. </p>

<p>SMYNES FEATURES : </p>

<p>&nbsp; SMYNES Emulates the master piece of Japanese Nintendo Family Computer. For that reason, 
the accuracy of hardware emulation is therefore very high. Not only the difficulties in emulating the 
Vbank and NMI have been solved, but also the sound probelm has been worked out by checking 
against the actual Nintendo machine. These sound emulations are therefore not captured from the 
spreaded infromation of internet. Since the sound was 100% emulated from the original 
Japanese Nintendo Family Computer, please do have confidence in what you hear! So far, 
some of the Taiwanes made and pirated Nintendo machines have abridged materials in making 
the sound parts for saving money. The natural sounds of those Nintendo machine are of 
course not as nice and accurate. Other than that, SMYNES has built in with the most 
Japanes original verion of game database. As long as your games are dumped from the 
correct Japanese verion roms, the information of games should be able to be displayed for 
the convenience of everyone. In the case of European version, the complete infromation is 
currently short of. Therefore, only English names are provided in the datatbase.
For those Japanese verion games that ought to have supported information, but those
information are not displayed, that means 90% of your roms have dumping problems. Surely, it
could also be our carelessness in missing typing some information. Nevertheless, we will continuely update the
database information. If you are definite that those games are dumped by yourself without problems, then please contact us 
for the updating of new database. At the moment we are still searching for the rom of 
mapper 2 &quot;Athena&quot; that was dumped from the original version card. We know that 
this mapper 2 &quot;Athena&quot; is the only one with the problems in our emulation so 
far. </p>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img src="2.gif" align="right" width="638" height="415">(Picture 2) This 
    is a very important setting image. If all the function keys have not been set then they 
    will not be to function, because SMYNES doesn't have the default key setting. We hope to 
    provide a most flexible conditions for the users to set functions for the keys. All the 
    function keys have &quot;Keyboard&quot; and &quot;Joystick&quot; these two parts for 
    setting. That means users don't have stick to keyboard setting. Some most common function 
    keys like &quot;Chat Enable Switch&quot; can also be set on the Joystick (as you wish).

    function of &quot;Cheat Edit&quot; to capture the information of the selected characters, 
    you only have to press &quot;Cheat Enable Switch&quot; button for the information to 
    disable temporary, until you press &quot;Chat Enable Switch&quot;, then it will recapture

    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Screen Shot Save</font> : After pressing this button, the images 
    of the game will be presented with the less information, but the best qulity of PNGcc 
    format for the output. It will also be saved in the path that was set at the begining.</p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Input Barcode :</font> This function can only be used under 
    Mapper 16 of DATCH swipping card machine that was publised by Bandai company. While you 
    are swipping the card character, you only need to press this button for a small window to

    switch between window and full screen </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">ROM Information :</font> Display the infromation of selected

    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Frame Skip Up</font> : If the speed of the game is too slow¡Ayou 
    can press this button to omit certain part of images. Too much omission will have serious 
    jumping problems¡Aand lead to block situation. However, this function can be used to 
    quickly jumped out those sections that you don't want to see.</p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Frame Skip Down :</font> It is opposite to the &quot;Fram Skip 
    Up&quot;</p>

    you the speed of how many pictures execute per second on the frame while the game is 
    progressing. If everything progresses smoothly, the number should be about 60. However, 
    the number is mostly displayed between 58~60. The smaller the number is displayed, the 
    worst the frame block problem appears. Users can use this function in the beginning to 
    help them contrasting among different display mode, to find out what display mode will 
    present the best frame condition.</td>

    column with information of Japanese files is therefore no as necessary. These columns can 
    be adjusted according to your needs. You simply need to drag mouse to the column that you 
    don't need or want to change the size, the sign of mouse will become adjustable left and 
    right arrow for you to adjust the column. And this adjusted columns will be recorded by 
    SMYNES. So there is no need for resetting when next time you execute SMYNES.</td>

<p><font color="#FF8080"><big>Usage Query FAQ¡G</big></font></p>

<p>Q1 : Why my game in SMYNES cannot be showen with game information?<br>
A1 : The most possible answer towards this problem is that your rom is not dumped from a 
Japanese version game card. Our game information has currently stored only 1245 Japanese 
version games. Of course, it could be our carelessness in omitting some of game 
information. However, it could also be the problems with the version of which game was 
dumped from.</p>

<p>Q2 : SMYNES execute so slow on my computer. Is there any way to improve it?<br>
A2 : Currently SMYNES is obviously slower in the S3 series of video cards. I don't really 
have answers for a such situation, but you can try to go to &quot;Emulator Setting&quot; 
and choose the second function &quot;NES Emulator Video Setup&quot;. After that, please 
follow the picture below for the rest set up - tick the bottom function &quot;Default 
Fullscreen Mode&quot; , and this will make some sort of speed improvement.<br>
<img src="6.gif" width="589" height="165" alt="6.gif (4667 bytes)"></p>

<p>If it is still too slow, please select &quot;NES Emulator Sound Setup&quot; Setupand 
change &quot;Sound ngine Select&quot; to &quot;Engine 2 (Fast)&quot; (As the image below) 
This should improve the speed, but diminishes the quality of sound.<br>
<img src="7.gif" width="165" height="69" alt="7.gif (848 bytes)"></p>

<p>Q3 : Why the games of Mapper 5, 6, 8, 17, 96, 188 cannot be executed?<br>
A3 : At the moment, SMYNES hasn't emulated 3 mappers - Mapper 5, 96, 188. However, the 
next SMYNES version might do it. About other 3 mappers- Mapper 6, 8, 17, the files of 
those games are reconstructed by &quot;FFE&quot; family computer disk system, and those 
games themselves have been changed. Therefore, SMYNES is not going to support those 
changed, reconstructed and error version of those Mapper 6, 8 and 17 games at the moment. 
In fact the correct version of those games can be easily find from the internet.</p>

<p>Q4 : How can you use the cheat function that is provided by SMYNES?<br>
A4 : While you are playing games, what you need to do is to press the set &quot;Cheat 
Editor&quot; button. Then, it will pop up the picture just like below<br>
<img src="5.gif" width="320" height="238" alt="5.gif (8349 bytes)"><br>
For the first searching, please press &quot;Reset Search&quot; and then press 
&quot;Exit&quot;. When the searched infromation is changed after playing games, you need 
to call the editing image, like increasing and decreasing. Of course, you can straight 
choose &quot;Value&quot; to enter number if you know what is the correct number. Please be 
awared that the number is made up by 16 bites. The search might not be able to carry out 
if the number is bigger than 9. Then press &quot;Search&quot; after finish chosing, the 
searched numbers will be appeared in the middle section of the image. Repeat the above 
actions by trying to change the locked information while playing the games. When there is 
only one set (or less) left in the middle section, you can then click twice in this 
section. At that moment, &quot;Lock Address (Hex)&quot; will appear in this section. You 
then only need to enter the lucked number in the &quot;Lock Valu (Hex) below, and press 
&quot;Add&quot; . If you want to stop the lock while playing the game, you can press the 
self pre-set button Cheat Enable Switch. However, you will get the hand of it with several 
practices. Also, these searched cheats will be automatically saved. They will be loaded 
when next time you start the game, which no search is required.</p>

<p>Q5 : Can I change the screen color of the game if I don't like it?<br>
A5 : YES¡ASMYNES has 9 types of color pallets, and it also includes most color pallets 
that are used by other famous emulators! You are free to choose any kind of color pallets. 
Of course, SMYNES also provides two self defined color pallets for users (No.0 and No.1 
color pallet). These two set color pallets can be freely defined, and save and read 
functions can also be perfomed there. </p>

<p>Q6 : Why is there a word &quot;DEMO&quot; in the middle of screen?<br>
A6 : SMYNES is a software that needs to be registed. There will be a word &quot;DEMO&quot; 
in the middle of the screen before the registration, and a 5 minutes limiation for playing 
games. If you believe SMYNES is a good software, please support me by registrations. This 
will also help me to build up my confidences to complete other better emulators. :)</p>

<p>Q7 : How much is the registration fee? How can I register SMYNES? Is the later updated 
version of SMYNES free of charge? How about if SMY has published other registered EMU in 
the future, would SMYNES registered users get certain kind of discount?<br>
A7 : The registration fee is NT$300 (New Taiwanese Dollars). There are two ways to be 
registered - by sending the actual money or transfering the account. Please refer to the 
end of this text for the more detailed information. :) That's right! Once you have 
registered SMYNES, any updated SMYNES will be free of charge. If SMYNES registeration has 
been strongly supported by everyone, we will shortly develop more of best EMU. All SMYNES 
members will get discount by that time. :)</p>

<p>Q8 : Why SMYNES is carried out by the registration way? Isn't free of charge great?<br>
A8 : After you have executed SMYNES, if you find that other version of EMU - which are 
free of charge - are either no difference or even better than SMYNES, then there is no 
needed for you to use SMYNES. Frankly, there are already many good and free of charge NES 
EMU existed in this field, such as Famtasia, Fwnes, NESten, Nesticle, etc. However, only 
the developing process of SMYNES have already spent us more than thousands of working 
times and countless Taiwanese money (such as buying the equipment of Nintendo Family 
Computer, making hareware testing cards, etc). The fees are all very dear! Because of 
these investement, SMYNES has reached an estimated of 97% accuracy in emulating Nintendo 
Family Computer. Only some of the errors of computers that are either too difficult or 
almost impossible to be adjusted are left currently, such as in the games of car racing in 
making a turn that sometimes lead to the disturbance of images. If you appreciate SMYNES, 
please support us in developing other even better emulators. :)</p>

<p>Q9 : May I please ask whether SMY has plans in developing other types of EMU?<br>
A9 : There is none currently as SMYNES has already spent too much my effort and money. At 
this stage, I'll only hope to present a even better version of SMYNES to those registered 
users. After all, I want to present the best! Of course when the developing of SMYNES has 
reached a certain limit, I'll then consider to develop other EMU.</p>

<p>Q10 : What is the function of <a href="http://smy.billyjr.com/JALECO1.ZIP">Mapper 86 
Jaleco sound file</a> that is provided on the website?<br>
A10 : This is the file especially supported&quot;Moero!! Pro Yakyuu&quot;, because there 
is a special sound chip in &quot;Moero!! Pro Yakyuu&quot;. So far, there is not other 
emulators to support such function. If you have this game, then you will be able to 
listen a real person's recorded voice just like from a real card while you are playing the 
game! You must try it :) However, other versions of &quot;Moero!! Pro Yakyuu&quot; will 
not have a such function supported at the moment. They will be supported in the next 
version of SMYNES. </p>

<p>Q11 : Why I can't play Disk System roms ?<br>
A11 : Well, you will need DISKROM.SYS file, this is a BIOS image frome the the Family 
Computer Disk System, you can find this file on the net very easy, and FWNES also use this 
file to load Disk System roms :)</p>

<p>Q12 : Where can I get the help if I still have other questions?<br>
A12 : I already asked Billy Jr. to help me to insert a discussion board on the net. 
Therefore, you can express any kind of questions when the discussion board is ready. </p>
