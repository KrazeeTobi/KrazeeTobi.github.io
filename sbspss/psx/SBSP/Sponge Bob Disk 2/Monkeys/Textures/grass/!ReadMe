Define                    =======================
|
| This directory contains a large number of demonstration textures designed to
| be used in conjunction with the Texture Garden program.  They are all plain
| text files.  To examine the textures they produce, load Texture Garden and
| drag the files into its main window.

Define Filtering | These are some textures that use filtering techniques.
|                  Many of these textures were degigned to simulate the effect
|                  of lightsourcing.  Now that Texture Garden supports
|                  a wide variety of bumpmapping and raytracing techniques,
|                  many of these textures are largely of historical interest.

| Enjoy.
