<h2 align="center"><b><i>Description</i></b></h2>
<p>While not an official contest, this was the first mapping contest for SRB2 and the inspiration for starting the OLDC. It was held between May and June 2003 by SRB2 developer a441 on his website, SRB2 World. Final Demo 1.01 was released during the submission period. The goal of the contest was to get more people interested in creating maps for SRB2, which only a few community members knew how to do at the time.</p>
<p>As with the first few OLDCs, only Match maps were accepted. As an additional constraint, only flats, textures and scenery items from Greenflower Zone were allowed to be used. Authors were not allowed to show their maps to other users before the submission deadline. a441 later regretted this, stating that some of the maps could have been improved by playtesting. Mystic incorporated this lesson into the OLDC, where it was encouraged to let other users test the maps before submission.</p>
<p>Voting for the contest occurred on the SRB2 Message Board. Since all message board records from before October 2003 were lost due to a crash, it is not known which voting system was used and which scores the maps received. Information about this contest was retrieved from the SRB2 World website and the now-defunct addons section of the SRB2 homepage, which were archived by Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, as well as the recovered contest WAD file provided below.</p>
<p>a441 submitted four of the five accepted maps himself. It is not known which map was not submitted by a441 and who created it. A sixth map was submitted by Mystic, but it was disqualified because it used the GFZ bridge textures, which a441 had forgotten to specify in the list of allowed textures. The map was added to SRB2 in v1.08 as Sapphire Falls Zone and is included in the game to this day. a441 later re-released two of his maps in the addons section of the SRB2 homepage, under the names Paragon Valley Zone and Stone Quadrant Zone. Stone Quadrant Zone was changed significantly for the re-release.</p>
<p>The contest file includes two bonus levels: the disqualified Sapphire Falls Zone as well as Two D Battle Zone, an experimental Match level in 2D mode.</p>
